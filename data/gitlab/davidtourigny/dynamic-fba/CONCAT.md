# Summary

Flux-balance analysis (FBA) is a computational method based on linear programming (LP) that has had enormous success modeling the metabolic behaviour of organisms and cellular systems existing in steady state with their environment [@Varma94; @Orth10]. Representing the corresponding biological model as an LP problem means that FBA can be used to study metabolism at genome-scale. Unfortunately, the underlying assumption of an unchanging environment means that FBA is not immediately applicable to systems with dynamics where, for example, environmental conditions may vary in time. Extensions of FBA, including dynamic FBA (DFBA) [@Mahadevan02], have therefore been developed in order to accommodate temporal dynamics into the framework of genome-scale metabolic modeling.

Although DFBA is well-defined mathematically as an LP problem embedded in a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), numerical simulation of DFBA models proves particularly challenging (as described in @Harwood16). Consequently, @Harwood16 proposed an algorithm for efficiently simulating DFBA models based on reformulating the ODE system as a differential algebraic equation (DAE) with root detection and representing solutions of the LP problem using an optimal basis formulation. An initial implementation of this algorithm has been provided in the software package DFBAlab [@Gomez14] written in MATLAB and using commercial LP solvers.

Increasingly, researchers engaged in metabolic modeling prefer open source software. Python is quickly becoming their platform of choice [@Carey20]. Among other packages, open source resources for building and simulating FBA models using Python can be found in the COBRApy [@Ebrahim13] package which is part of the openCOBRA organization [@opencobra]. Until now, COBRApy lacked an efficient implementation of DFBA using the DAE formulation.

## Statement of need:
_Researchers wanting to build and simulate specific models of interest often lack the background in numerical analysis or high-performance computing required to overcome the numerical challenges of DFBA_.

We have solved this issue by developing a software package based on open source libraries GLPK [@glpk] and SUNDIALS [@Hindmarsh05] that implements the most efficient algorithms in a compiled programming language that is made accessible to users through a simple and intuitive pybind11 [@pybind11] interface with pandas [@McKinney11] and the openCOBRA Python module COBRApy [@Ebrahim13]. ODEs are constructed using the symbolic expression enabled by optlang [@Jensen16], SymPy, and SymEngine [@Meurer17].

This project provides an object-oriented software package for dynamic
flux-balance analysis (DFBA) simulations using implementations of the direct
method or Algorithm 1 described in the paper `Harwood et al., 2016`_. The main
algorithms for solving embedded LP problems are written in *C++* and use the GNU
Linear Programming Kit (GLPK_) and the Suite of Nonlinear and
Differential/Algebraic Equation Solvers (SUNDIALS_) CVODE or IDA. Extension
modules to cobrapy_ are provided for easy generation and simulation of DFBA
models.

Installation
============

.. _GLPK: https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/
.. _SUNDIALS: https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials
.. _Python: https://www.python.org/
.. _cobrapy: https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy
.. _optlang: https://github.com/biosustain/optlang
.. _symengine: https://github.com/symengine/symengine

Currently, we do not provide Python wheels for this package and therefore `Installing from source`_ is a bit more involved. However, the package is now available on `conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dfba>`_ and can be installed in a conda environment. First, create an environment with Python_ (e.g. version 3.7):

.. code-block:: console

    conda create --name dfba python=3.7
    

Next, activate the environment using

.. code-block:: console

    conda activate dfba
    
and install `dfba <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dfba>`_ using

.. code-block:: console

     conda install -c conda-forge dfba
     
You can then use the software within the environment on the examples in the repository as well as your own DFBA models.


The quickest way to run the software without building anything locally
is from the provided `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/>`_ image:

.. code-block:: console

    docker run --rm -it davidtourigny/dfba:latest


Installing from source
----------------------

Currently this package is compatible with most UNIX-like operating systems.
Provided the following `Dependencies`_ are installed, the module
can be installed from source using the command:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install dfba

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _`build_glpk.sh`: https://gitlab.com/davidtourigny/dynamic-fba/tree/master/scripts/build_glpk.sh
.. _`build_pybind11.sh`: https://gitlab.com/davidtourigny/dynamic-fba/tree/master/scripts/build_pybind11.sh
.. _`build_sundials.sh`: https://gitlab.com/davidtourigny/dynamic-fba/tree/master/scripts/build_sundials.sh
.. _Dockerfile: https://gitlab.com/davidtourigny/dynamic-fba/tree/master/Dockerfile
.. _`pybind11`: https://github.com/pybind/pybind11


* A version of Python_ 3.6 or higher is required
* You need `cmake <https://cmake.org/>`_ for the build process
* You will need `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ to clone this repository to access
  the scripts and build files
* You need a working compiler with C++11 support, for example, by installing
  ``build-essential`` on Debian-derived Linux systems
* GLPK_ version 4.65 is required or can be installed using `build_glpk.sh`_
* SUNDIALS_ version 5.0.0 or higher is required or can be installed using `build_sundials.sh`_
* pybind11_ is required or can be installed using `build_pybind11.sh`_

Be aware that some of these packages have their own dependencies that must
therefore be installed also (e.g. GLPK_ depends on `GMP <https://gmplib.org/>`_
and pybind11_ requires `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_).


Alternatively, a Dockerfile_ is provided for building a `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/>`_
image to run the software from an interactive container. The `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/>`_ image can be
built in one step by issuing the command:

.. code-block:: console

    make build

from the root of this repository. It can then be started using:

.. code-block:: console

    make run

    conda activate dfba
    
and install `dfba <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dfba>`_ using

.. code-block:: console

     conda install -c conda-forge dfba
     
You can then use the software within the environment on the examples in the repository as well as your own DFBA models.


The quickest way to run the software without building anything locally
is from the provided `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/>`_ image. There are several ways to do this; we suggest using the following command to run Example 1 from the root of this repsitory:

.. code-block:: console

    docker run -it -v ${PWD}:/opt/examples davidtourigny/dfba python3 examples/example1.py

Provided `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/>`_ is installed correctly, the first time you run this command the latest image will be pulled from dockerhub (unless you have previously pulled or built it yourself using the instructions at the bottom of this page). All subsequent runs will use this same image, and you can replace  ``examples/example1.py`` with the path to a Python_ script containing your own DFBA model. To access results of each simulation, we recommend including the pandas_ method  ``to_csv()`` inside your script in order to write the data frame of results to a csv file (e.g., see :doc:`example1` or uncomment lines 107 and 108 in script example1_).

* A version of Python_ 3.6 or higher is required
* You need `cmake <https://cmake.org/>`_ for the build process
* You will need `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ to clone this repository to access
  the scripts and build files
* You need a working compiler with C++11 support, for example, by installing
  ``build-essential`` on Debian-derived Linux systems
* GLPK_ version 4.65 is required or can be installed using `build_glpk.sh`_
* SUNDIALS_ version 5.0.0 or higher is required or can be installed using `build_sundials.sh`_
* pybind11_ is required or can be installed using `build_pybind11.sh`_

Be aware that some of these packages have their own dependencies that must
therefore be installed also (e.g. GLPK_ depends on `GMP <https://gmplib.org/>`_
and pybind11_ requires `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_).


Alternatively, a Dockerfile_ is provided for building a `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/>`_
image to run the software from an interactive container. The `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/>`_ image can be
built in one step by issuing the command:

.. code-block:: console

    make build

from the root of the `repository <https://gitlab.com/davidtourigny/dynamic-fba>`_. It can then be started using:

.. code-block:: console

    make run
.. dfba documentation main file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Thu Nov 28 10:05:22 2019.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

This project provides an object-oriented software package for dynamic
flux-balance analysis (DFBA) simulations using implementations of the direct
method or Algorithm 1 described in the paper `Harwood et al., 2016 <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-015-0760-3>`_. The main
algorithms for solving embedded LP problems are written in C++ and use the GNU
Linear Programming Kit (GLPK_) and the Suite of Nonlinear and
Differential/Algebraic Equation Solvers (SUNDIALS_) CVODE or IDA. Extension
modules to cobrapy_ are provided for easy generation and simulation of DFBA
models.

Overview
========

.. _`pybind11`: https://github.com/pybind/pybind11
.. _examples: https://gitlab.com/davidtourigny/dynamic-fba/tree/main/examples

This software package implements the fastest and most robust DFBA simulation algorithms in a compiled programming language that is made accessible to users through a simple and intuitive interface with cobrapy_. The target audience is researchers wanting to build and efficiently simulate specific DFBA models of interest, but not spend their time wrestling with the numerical challenges of DFBA. Users are not expected to interact directly with the lower-level *C++* interface
and once installed the package should ideally remain untouched. Instead, the
classes and functions for solving embedded LP problems have been exposed to
Python_ using `pybind11`_. Combined with the provided cobrapy_ extension
modules, this provides the user with the ability to build their own DFBA model
exclusively in Python_.  

The Python_ class :class:`dfba.DfbaModel` intuitively encapsulates
all the data required for a full definition of a DFBA model by combining an
underlying cobrapy_ object with instances of the :class:`dfba.KineticVariable` and
:class:`dfba.ExchangeFlux` classes. The :class:`dfba.DfbaModel` class instance ensures all user data are
consistent with the initialization and simulation requirements of an embedded LP
problem. User data are passed directly to the algorithms and symbolic functions
are dynamically compiled and loaded prior to simulation.  

The directory examples_ also contains scripts for the examples described in the :doc:`examples` section,
and details on how the user can adapt these to build and simulate their own model are outlined in the section :doc:`example1`.

Source files contained within the directory src_ are split between two
sub-directories separated by their language of implementation.

*C++*
-----

.. _Python: https://www.python.org/

The sub-directory extension_ contains the following content:

* `dfba_utils.cpp`_: contains source code for exposing the extension module to Python_
* emblp_: contains class and function declarations for embedded LP problems
* methods_: contains algorithms for integration of embedded LP problems
* `solver_data.h`_: struct exposed to Python_ for solver options
* `user_data.h`_: struct exposed to Python_ for model specification

*Python*
--------

The directory dfba_ contains the following content:

* `control.py`_: definition of class :class:`dfba.ControlParameter`
* `exchange.py`_: definition of class :class:`dfba.ExchangeFlux`
* `helpers.py`_: general helper functions
* `jit.py`_: tools for JIT compilation of dynamic library
* `model.py`_: definition of class :class:`dfba.DfbaModel`
* `library.py`_: methods for writing dynamic library
* `variables.py`_: definition of class :class:`dfba.KineticVariable`
* `plot`_: directory for additional visualization dependency
Visualization
-------------

Visualization tools are available as an extra dependency, optionally installed 
from the root of the `repository <https://gitlab.com/davidtourigny/dynamic-fba>`_ using the commands.

.. code-block:: console

    pip install .[plotly]

or

.. code-block:: console

    pip install .[matplotlib]

Usage of these libraries in the package is exemplified in :doc:`example1`.

It is also possible to run `Jupyterlab <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_
in an interactive `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/>`_ container and access the visualization tools
through your browser:

.. code-block:: console

    docker run --rm -it -p 8888:8888 -v $PWD:/opt davidtourigny/dfba:latest-interactive bash

Once the image is running, start `Jupyterlab <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ using the command:

.. code-block:: console

    jupyter lab --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root

This will display a URL that should be used to open the notebook in your browser. From
there you will be able to interact with the examples and build your own DFBA model.
