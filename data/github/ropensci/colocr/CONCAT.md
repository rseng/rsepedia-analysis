# colocr

An R package for conducting co-localization analysis.

## Overview

A few R packages are available for conducting image analysis, which is a very wide topic. As a result, some of us might feel at a loss when all they want to do is a simple co-localization calculations on a small number of microscopy images. This package provides a simple straight forward workflow for loading images, choosing regions of interest (ROIs) and calculating co-localization statistics. Included in the package, is a [shiny app](https://shiny.rstudio.com) that can be invoked locally to interactively select the regions of interest in a semi-automatic way. The package is based on the R package [`imager`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=imager).


## Installing `colocr`
`colocr` is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) 
and can be installed using

```r
# install from cran
install.packages('colocr')
```

The package development version is available at [github](https://github.com/ropensci/colocr).

```r
# install from github
devtools::install_github('ropensci/colocr')
```

This package depends on `imager` which has some external dependencies. The instructions for installing `imager` can be found
[here](https://github.com/dahtah/imager).

## Getting started

To get started, load the required packages and the images. The images below
are from [DU145](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DU145) cell line and were 
stained for two proteins; [RKIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raf_kinase_inhibitor_protein) and [LC3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAP1LC3B).
Then, apply the appropriate parameters for choosing the regions of interest
using the `roi_select`. Finally, check the appropriateness of the 
parameters by highlighting the ROIs on the image.

```r
# load libraries
library(colocr)

# load images
fl <- system.file('extdata', 'Image0001_.jpg', package = 'colocr')
img <- image_load(fl)

# select ROI and show the results
par(mfrow = c(2,2), mar = rep(1, 4))

img %>%
  roi_select(threshold = 90) %>%
  roi_show()
```

The same can be achieved interactively using an accompanying **shiny** app.
To launch the app run.

```r
run_app()
```

The reset of the analysis depends on the particular kind of images. Now, `colocr`
implements two simple co-localization statistics; Pearson's Coefficient Correlation [(PCC)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20653013) and the Manders Overlap Coefficient [(MOC)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3074624/).

To apply both measures of correlation, we first get the pixel intensities and call `roi_test` on the merge image.

```r
# calculate co-localization statistics
img %>%
  roi_select(threshold = 90) %>%
  roi_test(type = 'both')
```

The same analysis and more can be conducted using a web interface for the package available [here](https://mahshaaban.shinyapps.io/colocr_app2/)
