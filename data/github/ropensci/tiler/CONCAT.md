## Create geographic and non-geographic map tiles

The `tiler` package provides a tile generator function for creating map
tile sets for use with packages such as `leaflet`. In addition to
generating map tiles based on a common raster layer source, it also
handles the non-geographic edge case, producing map tiles from arbitrary
images. These map tiles, which have a a non-geographic simple coordinate
reference system, can also be used with `leaflet` when applying the
simple CRS option.

Map tiles can be created from an input file with any of the following
extensions: `tif`, `grd` and `nc` for spatial maps and `png`, `jpg` and
`bmp` for basic images.

## Motivation

This package helps R users who wish to create geographic and
non-geographic map tiles easily and seamlessly with only a single line
of R code. The intent is to do this with a package that has

  - minimal heavy package dependencies.
  - minimal extraneous general features and functions that do not have
    to do with tile generation.
  - to create tiles without having to code directly in other software,
    interact directly with Python, or make calls at the command line;
    allowing the R user to remain comfortably within the familiar R
    environment.
  - to support the creation on map tiles from raw images for users who
    wish to create non-standard maps, which may also be followed by
    georeferencing locations of interest in the simplified coordinate
    reference system of the map image.

## Installation

Install `tiler` from CRAN with

``` r
install.packages("tiler")
```

Install the development version from GitHub with

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ropensci/tiler")
```

For non-geographic tiles, using a `png` file is recommended for quality
and file size. `jpg` may yield a lower quality result, while a large,
high resolution `bmp` file may have an enormous file size compared to
`png`.

`jpg` and `bmp` are *optionally* supported by `tiler`. This means they
are not installed and imported with `tiler`. It is assumed the user will
provide `png` images. If using `jpg` or `bmp` and the packages `jpeg` or
`bmp` are not installed, respectively, `tile` will print a message to
the console notifying of the required package installations.

### System requirements

This package requires Python and the `gdal` library for Python. Windows
users are recommended to install
[OSGeo4W](https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/) as an easy way to obtain the
required `gdal` support for Python in Windows. See `?tiler_options` or
the package vignette for more information.

# tiler 0.2.5

* Documentation updates.

# tiler 0.2.4

* Precompiling of vignette depending on external data.

# tiler 0.2.3

* Minor fixes for CRAN release.

# tiler 0.2.2

* Breaking change: no longer using a `format` argument. All tiles are TMS.
* Updated `gdal2tiles` to version 2.4 release.
* Bug fix.
* Updated documentation.

# tiler 0.2.1

* Improved and simplified instructions and expectations for Windows use. Windows users must add `OSGeo4W.bat` path to system path.
* Added `leaflet` examples of remotely hosted tiles generated by `tiler` to vignette.
* Bug fix related to system path to `OSGeo4W.bat` being ignored on Windows.

# tiler 0.2.0

* All three `gdal2tiles*` scripts have been updated to accept a command line argument when called by R that provides a path for any temporary files, i.e., `tmp.*.vrt` files created by the `gdal2tiles*` scripts. These were previously accumulating in the system temp folder. The new temporary directory is a sub-directory inside `tempdir()`. Therefore, it is cleaned up when exiting R. Nevertheless, `tile` also force deletes this subdirectory immediately after its internal system call to one of the `gdal2tiles*` scripts returns, so the temporary sub-directory does not even exist for the full duration of the `tile` call.
* Added functions `tile_viewer` and `view_tiles` and other supporting functions for generating HTML Leaflet tile preview web page.
* Added arguments to `tile`. `tile` now generates previewer by default.
* Added unit tests.
* Updated vignette.

# tiler 0.1.6

* Made minor formatting changes per CRAN request for resubmission.

# tiler 0.1.5

* Refactored `tile`, added arguments including `resume` and `format`, changed some argument names.
* Added default support for XYZ format tiles in addition to TMS. This brings in another version of `gdal2tiles`.
* Updated documentation.
* Added unit tests.

# tiler 0.1.0

* Created `tile` function for generating map tiles from geographic or non-geographic maps/images.
* Created readme with basic example.
* Added initial introduction vignette.
* Added robust unit tests and other external examples and spot testing of edge cases.

# tiler 0.0.0.9000

* Added initial package scaffolding.
