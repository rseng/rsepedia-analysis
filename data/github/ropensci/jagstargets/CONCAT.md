Bayesian data analysis usually incurs long runtimes and cumbersome
custom code, and the process of prototyping and deploying custom
[JAGS](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io) models can become a daunting
software engineering challenge. To ease this burden, the `jagstargets` R
package creates [JAGS](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io) pipelines that
are concise, efficient, scalable, and tailored to the needs of Bayesian
statisticians. Leveraging
[`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/), `jagstargets` pipelines
automatically parallelize the computation and skip expensive steps when
the results are already up to date. Minimal custom user-side code is
required, and there is no need to manually configure branching, so
`jagstargets` is easier to use than
[`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) and
[`R2jags`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R2jags) directly.

## Prerequisites

1.  The [prerequisites of the `targets` R
    package](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/#prerequisites).
2.  Basic familiarity with
    [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/): watch minutes 7
    through 40 of [this video](https://youtu.be/Gqn7Xn4d5NI?t=439), then
    read [this
    chapter](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html) of the
    [user manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/).
3.  Familiarity with Bayesian Statistics and
    [JAGS](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/). Prior knowledge of
    [`rjags`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rjags) or
    [`R2jags`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=R2jags) helps.

## How to get started

Read the `jagstargets` [introductory
vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/jagstargets/articles/introduction.html),
and then use <https://docs.ropensci.org/jagstargets/> as a reference
while constructing your own workflows. If you need to analyze large
collections of simulated datasets, please consult the [simulation
vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/jagstargets/articles/simulation.html).

## Installation

`jagstargets` requires the user to install
[JAGS](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/),
[`rjags`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rjags), and
[`R2jags`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R2jags) beforehand. You
can install JAGS from <https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/>, and you can
install the rest from CRAN.

``` r
install.packages(c("rjags", "R2jags"))
```

Then, install the latest release from CRAN.

``` r
install.packages("jagstargets")
```

Alternatively, install the GitHub development version to access the
latest features and patches.

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ropensci/jagstargets")
```

## Usage

Begin with one or more models: for example, the simple regression model
below with response variable *y* and covariate *x*.

<center>
<img src="./man/figures/model.gif">
</center>

Next, write a JAGS model file for each model like the `model.jags` file
below.

``` jags
model {
  for (i in 1:n) {
    y[i] ~ dnorm(x[i] * beta, 1)
  }
  beta ~ dnorm(0, 1)
}
```

To begin a reproducible analysis pipeline with this model, write a
[`_targets.R` file](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html)
that loads your packages, defines a function to generate JAGS data, and
lists a pipeline of targets. The target list can call target factories
like
[`tar_jags()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/jagstargets/reference/tar_jags.html)
as well as ordinary targets with
[`tar_target()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_target.html).
The following minimal example is simple enough to contain entirely
within the `_targets.R` file, but for larger projects, you may wish to
store functions in separate files as in the
[`targets-stan`](https://github.com/wlandau/targets-stan) example.

``` r
# _targets.R
library(targets)
library(jagstargets)

generate_data <- function() {
  true_beta <- stats::rnorm(n = 1, mean = 0, sd = 1)
  x <- seq(from = -1, to = 1, length.out = n)
  y <- stats::rnorm(n, x * true_beta, 1)
  out <- list(n = n, x = x, y = y, true_beta = true_beta)
}

list(
  tar_jags(
    example,
    jags_files = "model.jags", # You provide this file.
    parameters.to.save = "beta",
    data = generate_data()
  )
)
```

Run
[`tar_visnetwork()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_visnetwork.html)
to check `_targets.R` for correctness, then call
[`tar_make()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_make.html)
to run the pipeline. Access the results using
[`tar_read()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_read.html),
e.g.Â `tar_read(tar_read(example_summary_x)`. Visit the [introductory
vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/jagstargets/articles/introduction.html)
to read more about this example.

## How the package works

`jagstargets` supports specialized [target
factories](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/02/03/targets/#target-factories)
that create ensembles of [target
objects](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_target.html)
for [`R2jags`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R2jags) workflows.
These [target
factories](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/02/03/targets/#target-factories)
abstract away the details of
[`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) and
[`R2jags`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R2jags) and make both
packages easier to use. For details, please read the [introductory
vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/jagstargets/articles/introduction.html).

## Help

If you have trouble using `jagstargets`, you can ask for help in the
[GitHub discussions
forum](https://github.com/ropensci/jagstargets/discussions/categories/help).
Because the purpose of `jagstargets` is to combine
[`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) and
[`R2jags`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R2jags), your issue may
have something to do with one of the latter two packages, a [dependency
of
`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets/blob/4e3ef2a6c986f558a25e544416f480fc01236b6b/DESCRIPTION#L49-L88),
or [`R2jags`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R2jags) itself. When
you troubleshoot, peel back as many layers as possible to isolate the
problem. For example, if the issue comes from
[`R2jags`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R2jags), create a
[reproducible example](https://reprex.tidyverse.org) that directly
invokes [`R2jags`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R2jags) without
invoking `jagstargets`. The GitHub discussion and issue forums of those
packages are great resources.

# Statement of need

Researchers who perform Bayesian statistics regularly experiment with models to refine, compare, and understand them [@bayesworkflow]. Each fitted model informs subsequent model-building choices, and even for experienced practitioners, the investigation often leads to final models that differ from the ones originally proposed. Fitting a model usually means applying Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or a similar method to approximate the full joint posterior distribution of the parameters [@bda3]. Flexible probabilistic programming languages such as JAGS have made model specification quick and straightforward [@jags], but computation time is still a bottleneck. A workflow can take several minutes or hours to run, and in subsequent iterations, researchers struggle to keep the results up to date with frequent changes to the models, code, and data.

# Summary

The [`jagstargets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/jagstargets/) R package [@jagstargets] is a workflow toolkit for Bayesian data analysis with JAGS. It helps users express a Bayesian statistical modeling exercise as a formal pipeline with dedicated steps for data generation, analysis, and summarization. Pipelines can be customized for popular use cases: for example, the analysis of a single dataset using multiple alternative models, or a large simulation study to test that a model is implemented correctly [@carpenter2017]. These pipelines, which can be visualized and executed using [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) [@targets], support key features that increase the efficiency and reproducibility of Bayesian workflows. The steps of a pipeline are automatically orchestrated using optional distributed computing, and up-to-date tasks are automatically skipped if the upstream code and data did not change since the last run. Thus, researchers can quickly iterate on Bayesian workflows while maintaining agreement between the results and the underlying code, models, and datasets.

The [`jagstargets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/jagstargets/) package is a bridge between packages [`R2jags`](https://github.com/suyusung/R2jags) [@R2jags] and [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/). [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) is a general-purpose pipeline toolkit for reproducible research and high-performance computing. It can be used on its own for Bayesian data analysis, but it does not natively support  domain-specific functionality for Bayesian workflows or JAGS. [`jagstargets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/jagstargets/), on the other hand, leverages the existing capabilities of [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) to more easily and concisely express computational pipelines for Bayesian data analysis, from single analyses or large-scale simulation studies. It abstracts away laborious error-prone tasks such as invoking JAGS, tidying posterior samples, and batching thousands of MCMC runs to improve computational efficiency, all of which reduce the user-side burden of writing custom R code for a [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) pipeline. [`jagstargets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) is similar to the [`stantargets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/stantargets/) R package [@stantargets], the latter of which streamlines pipeline construction of Bayesian data analysis pipelines with Stan [@stan].
