Popler
======

`popler` is the R package to browse and query the `popler` data base. `popler` is a PostgreSQL data base that contains population-level datasets from the US long term ecological research (LTER) network. This package is currently only available on GitHub, but our ultimate goal is to submit it to CRAN. A detailed explanation on the structure of the `popler` online database is contained in the [dratf of the manuscript presenting popler](https://github.com/texmiller/popler-ms/blob/master/popler_ms.pdf) and in the [dedicated vignette](https://github.com/AldoCompagnoni/popler/blob/master/vignettes/popler-database-structure.Rmd). The `popler` database is organized around four types of tables:

A. The tables containing information on population abundance. Population abundance can be of five types: count, biomass, cover, density, and at the individual-level.

B. A table containg to link each abundance value to the taxonomic units it refers to. In `popler`, "taxonomic unit" generally refers to a species.

C. The location of each "site". With "site" we refers to the largest spatial replicate available for a dataset. Many datasets provide abundance data from more than one site.

D. Metadata information referring to each separate dataset.

Popler rationale
================

The package `popler` aims to facilitate finding, retrieving, and using time-series data of population abundance associated with the US LTER network. To *find datasets*, the functions in `popler` aid in understanding and browsing the metadata information referring to each dataset. To *retrieve* data, the function `pplr_get_data()` downloads single datasets or groups of datasets. These downloads share the same data structure. To *use* downloaded data, the package provides ancillary functions to consult and cite the original data sources, examine the temporal replication of each data set, and methods for a couple of `dplyr` verbs to assist with data manipulation.

### Installation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

``` r
# Install stable version once on CRAN (hopefully soon!)
install.packages('popler')


# Install development version now
if(!require(devtools, quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages(devtools)
}

devtools::install_github('ropensci/popler')
```

All exported functions in the `popler` R package use the `pplr_` prefix. Moreover, the functions use lazy and/or tidy evaluation, meaning you do not need to manually quote most inputs.

Finding datasets
================

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Dictionary of variables

We suggest to start exploring the metadata variables describing each dataset in popler using `pplr_dictionary()`. This function works in two ways:

1.  It provides a general description of each metadata variable. This happens when this function is called without arguments; for example, when calling `pplr_dictionary()`.
2.  It provides the possible values of its unquoted arguments. For example, when calling `pplr_dictionary( proj_metadata_key )`.

The output of `pplr_dictionary()` is a data frame showing a description of each metadata variable.

``` r
library(popler)
pplr_dictionary()
```

    ##             variable
    ## 1              title
    ## 2  proj_metadata_key
    ## 3             lterid
    ## 4           datatype
    ## 5    structured_data
    ## 6          studytype
    ## 7     duration_years
    ## 8          community

    ## 14           kingdom
    ## 15            phylum
    ## 16             class
    ## 17             order
    ## 18            family
    ## 19             genus
    ##                                                description
    ## 1                                         title of project
    ## 2                                        unique project id
    ## 3                                                lter name
    ## 4              type of abundance data (e.g. count,biomass)
    ## 5  are abundance observations grouped (e.g. based on age)?
    ## 6                     experimental or observational study?
    ## 7                             duration of project in years
    ## 8                     does data set contain multiple taxa?
    ## 9                            types of indidivual structure
    ## 10                                      types of treatment
    ## 11                                      lter site latitude
    ## 12                                     lter site longitude
    ## 13                    specific epithet of a taxonomic unit
    ## 14                                                 kingdom
    ## 15                                                  phylum
    ## 16                                                   class
    ## 17                                                   order
    ## 18                                                  family
    ## 19                                                   genus

However, this function is more powerful when used with an argument. When `pplr_dictionary()` is provided with the name of a metadata variable, it returns the possible unique values of the variable. For example, providing `datatype` shows that popler contains five types of abundance data:

``` r
pplr_dictionary( datatype )
```

    ## $`datatype (NA)`
    ## [1] "individual"  "count"       "cover"       "biomass"     "density"    
    ## [6] "basal_cover"

Additionally, the `pplr_report_dictionary()` function generates an `Rmd` file and renders it into html. This html contains both the meaning of variables, and their unique values.

##### Browsing `popler`

Once you are familiar with the meaning and content of `popler`'s metadata variables, `pplr_browse()` provides the metadata of the studies contained in `popler`. `pplr_browse()` also works with and without an input. Without input, the function produces a data frame including the metadata variables describing every study currently contained in the `popler` database. Note that this data frame is a `tbl` that inherits from the `browse` class. Inputs to `pplr_browse()` allow users to subset this data frame (e.g. `duration_years > 5`). When subsetting, the unique values provided by `pplr_dictionary()` are particularly useful. For more nuanced subsetting of available datasets, the `keyword` argument allows to subset variables using partial matching. Note that `keyword` will act primarily on information contained in the title of studies.

``` r
all_studies <- pplr_browse()

# do not quote logical expressions
long_studies <- pplr_browse(duration_years > 20) 

# keyword is quoted
parasite_studies <- pplr_browse(keyword = 'parasite') 
```

The default settings of both `pplr_browse()` and `pplr_dictionary()` report a subset of the metadata variables contained in popler. To report all variables, set `full_tbl = TRUE`.

``` r
#  vars are quoted
interesting_studies <- pplr_browse(vars = c('duration_years', 'lterid')) 

# Use full_tbl = TRUE to get a table with all possible variables
all_studies_and_vars <- pplr_browse(full_tbl = TRUE)
```

##### Reporting metadata

You can generate a human-readable report on metadata variables of the projects you subset using `pplr_browse` by providing the function with the argument `report = TRUE` . This argument uses `rmarkdown` to render the metadata into an html file, and opens it into your default browser. Alternatively, you can perform the same action described above by providing the `browse` object produced calling `pplr_browse` to the function `pplr_report_metadata()`.

``` r
# generate metadata report for all studies
pplr_browse(report=TRUE)
# alternatively
all_studies <- pplr_browse()
pplr_report_metadata(all_studies)

# generate metadata report for parasite studies
pplr_browse(keyword = 'parasite', report = TRUE)
parasite_studies <- pplr_browse(keyword = 'parasite') 
# alternatively
pplr_report_metadata(parasite_studies)
```

Retrieving data
===============

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you explored the metadata and decided which projects interest you, it's time to actually download the data! `pplr_get_data()` connects to the data base via an API, and downloads the raw data based on the criteria supplied. Alternatively, if you're happy with the projects represented in the `browse` object you created earlier, you can simply pass that object to `pplr_get_data()`. Note that if your `browse` object contains 5 rows, `pplr_get_data()` will download 5 separate datasets. All objects created with `pplr_get_data()` inherit from `get_data` and `data.frame` classes.

``` r
# create a browse object and use it to get data

penguins <- pplr_browse(lterid == 'PAL')

# unpack covariates as well

penguin_raw_data <- pplr_get_data(penguins, cov_unpack = TRUE)

# A very specific query

more_raw_data <- pplr_get_data((proj_metadata_key == 43 | 
                                proj_metadata_key == 25) & 
                                year < 1995 )
```

Using data
==========

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We provide three ancillary functions to facilitate the use of the objects downloaded through `pplr_get_data()`.

First, `pplr_metadata_url()` opens up a webpage containing study details. Before doing scientific analyses, we urge the users to review the peculiarities of each dataset by vetting their online documentation. Importantly, `pplr_metadata_url()` also works on objects produced by `pplr_browse`.

Second, `pplr_cov_unpack()` transforms the data contained in the `covariates` column of each downloaded dataset into separate columns. This can or cannot be useful depending on the objectives of the user. Note: you can also transform covariates into a data frame directly through `pplr_get_data()` by providing the function with argument `cov_unpack = TRUE`.

Third, `pplr_citation()` produces a citation for each downloaded dataset.

##### Spatio-temporal replication

The datasets contained in `popler` present many heterogeneities, especially in terms of their spatio-temporal replication. Most studies present at least a few spatial replicates which were not sampled every year. Note that most datasets in `popler` present at least one additional replication level. These spatial replicates are denoted with numbered variables of the form `spatial_replication_level_X`, where `X` refers to the replication level which can go from 1 to 5. The names of these replication levels (e.g. plot, subplot, etc.) are contained in variable `spatial_replication_level_x_label`.

Once you download a dataset, you can examine the temporal replication of the largest spatial replicate (the site, or `spatial_replication_level_1`) using function `pplr_site_rep_plot()`. This function produces a plot showing whether or not a given site was sampled in a year.

``` r
# download and plot yearly spatial replication for dataset 1
kelp_df      <- pplr_get_data( proj_metadata_key == 1)
pplr_site_rep_plot( kelp_df )
```

![](README_files/figure-markdown_github/spatial_rep_plot-1.png)

Additionally, `pplr_site_rep()` produces either a logical vector for subsetting an existing `get_data` object or a summary table of temporal replication for a given spatial resolution. You can control the minimum frequency of sampling and the minimum duration of sampling using the `freq` and `duration` arguments, respectively. Additionally, you can choose the level of spatial replication to filter providing an integer between 1 and 5 to the `rep_level` argument. `return_logical` allows you to control what is returned by the function. `TRUE` returns a logical vector corresponding to rows of the `get_data` that correspond to spatial replicates that meet the criteria of replication specified in the function. `FALSE` returns a summary table describing the number of samples per year at the selected spatial resolution.

``` r
# Example with piping and subsetting w/ the logical vector output

library(dplyr)

SEV_studies <- pplr_get_data( lterid == 'SEV' datatype == 'invidual' )

long_SEV_studies <- SEV_studies %>%
  .[pplr_site_rep(input = .,
                  duration = 12,
                  rep_level = 3), ] %>%
  pplr_site_rep_plot()

# Or, create the summary table

SEV_summary <- SEV_studies %>% 
  pplr_site_rep(duration = 13,
                rep_level = 1,
                return_logical = FALSE)


# Modify the site_rep_plot() by hand using ggplot2 syntax
library(ggplot2)

pplr_site_rep_plot(long_SEV_studies, return_plot = TRUE) +
  ggtitle('Sevilleta LTER Temporal Replication')
```

##### Data manipulation

`popler` supplies methods for a couple of `dplyr` verbs to assist with data manipulation. `filter` and `mutate` methods are available for objects of `browse` and `get_data` classes. Other `dplyr` verbs change the structure of the object too much for those classes to retain their meaning so they are not included in the package, but one can still use them for their own purposes.

``` r
penguins_98 <- filter(penguin_raw_data, year == 1998)

class(penguins_98) # classes are not stripped from objects

penguins_98_true <- mutate(penguins_98, penguins_are = 'Awesome')

class(penguins_98_true)
```

Further information
===================

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional information on `popler` is contained in a manuscript, and in the vignettes associated with the R package.

The [manuscript, currently in draft form](https://github.com/texmiller/popler-ms/blob/master/popler_ms.pdf), presents the `popler` database, the R package, and our recommendations on how to use them.

The R package contains three vignettes: one vignette [illustrates the structure of the popler database](https://github.com/AldoCompagnoni/popler/blob/master/vignettes/popler-database-structure.Rmd), and two vignettes provide [an introduction](https://github.com/AldoCompagnoni/popler/blob/master/vignettes/introduction-to-popler.Rmd) and [a more detailed look](https://github.com/AldoCompagnoni/popler/blob/master/vignettes/vetting-popler.Rmd) at the intended workflow of the popler package.

In case these vignettes do not cover your particular use case, you still have questions, or you discover a bug, please don't hesitate to create an [issue](https://github.com/AldoCompagnoni/popler/issues).

### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure someone from the team agrees that it's a problem. If you've found a
bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal 
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

### Pull request process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  
*  Look at the Travis and AppVeyor build status before and after making changes.
The `README` should contain badges for any continuous integration services used
by the package.  
*  New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org).
You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to
apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with 
your PR.  
*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with
[Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/markdown.html), 
for documentation.  
*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). It is highly
unlikely that we will accept changes without associated tests, but there are 
instances where an exception can be made (some code can be very hard to test).
*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the current
development version header describing the changes made followed by your GitHub
username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).
