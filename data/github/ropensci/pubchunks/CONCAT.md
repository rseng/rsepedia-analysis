## Get chunks of XML articles


## Package API

 - pub_tabularize
 - pub_guess_publisher
 - pub_sections
 - pub_chunks
 - pub_providers

The main workhorse function is `pub_chunks()`. It allows you to pull out sections of articles from many different publishers (see next section below) WITHOUT having to know how to parse/navigate XML. XML has a steep learning curve, and can require quite a bit of Googling to sort out how to get to different parts of an XML document. 

The other main function is `pub_tabularize()` - which takes the output of `pub_chunks()` and coerces into a data.frame for easier downstream processing.

## Supported publishers/sources

- eLife
- PLOS
- Entrez/Pubmed
- Elsevier
- Hindawi
- Pensoft
- PeerJ
- Copernicus
- Frontiers
- F1000 Research

If you know of other publishers or sources that provide XML let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/ropensci/pubchunks/issues).

We'll continue adding additional publishers.


## Installation

Stable version


```r
install.packages("pubchunks")
```

Development version from GitHub


```r
remotes::install_github("ropensci/pubchunks")
```

Load library


```r
library('pubchunks')
```

## Working with files


```r
x <- system.file("examples/10_1016_0021_8928_59_90156_x.xml", 
  package = "pubchunks")
```


```r
pub_chunks(x, "abstract")
#> <pub chunks>
#>   from: file
#>   publisher/journal: elsevier/Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics
#>   sections: abstract
#>   showing up to first 5: 
#>    abstract (n=1): Abstract
#>                
#>                   This pa ...
pub_chunks(x, "title")
#> <pub chunks>
#>   from: file
#>   publisher/journal: elsevier/Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics
#>   sections: title
#>   showing up to first 5: 
#>    title (n=1): On the driving of a piston with a rigid collar int ...
pub_chunks(x, "authors")
#> <pub chunks>
#>   from: file
#>   publisher/journal: elsevier/Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics
#>   sections: authors
#>   showing up to first 5: 
#>    authors (n=1): Chetaev, D.N
pub_chunks(x, c("title", "refs"))
#> <pub chunks>
#>   from: file
#>   publisher/journal: elsevier/Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics
#>   sections: title, refs
#>   showing up to first 5: 
#>    title (n=1): On the driving of a piston with a rigid collar int ...
#>    refs (n=6): Watson G.N.. 1949. Teoriia besselevykh funktsii. N
```

The output of `pub_chunks()` is a list with an S3 class `pub_chunks` to make 
internal work in the package easier. You can easily see the list structure 
by using `unclass()`.

## Working with the xml already in a string


```r
xml <- paste0(readLines(x), collapse = "")
pub_chunks(xml, "title")
#> <pub chunks>
#>   from: character
#>   publisher/journal: elsevier/Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics
#>   sections: title
#>   showing up to first 5: 
#>    title (n=1): On the driving of a piston with a rigid collar int ...
```

## Working with xml2 class object


```r
xml <- paste0(readLines(x), collapse = "")
xml <- xml2::read_xml(xml)
pub_chunks(xml, "title")
#> <pub chunks>
#>   from: xml_document
#>   publisher/journal: elsevier/Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics
#>   sections: title
#>   showing up to first 5: 
#>    title (n=1): On the driving of a piston with a rigid collar int ...
```

## Working with output of fulltext::ft_get()


```r
install.packages("fulltext")
```


```r
library("fulltext")
x <- fulltext::ft_get('10.1371/journal.pone.0086169')
pub_chunks(fulltext::ft_collect(x), sections="authors")
#> $plos
#> $plos$`10.1371/journal.pone.0086169`
#> <pub chunks>
#>   from: xml_document
#>   publisher/journal: plos/PLoS ONE
#>   sections: authors
#>   showing up to first 5: 
#>    authors (n=4): nested list
#> 
#> 
#> attr(,"ft_data")
#> [1] TRUE
```

## Coerce pub_chunks output into data.frame's


```r
x <- system.file("examples/elife_1.xml", package = "pubchunks")
res <- pub_chunks(x, c("doi", "title", "keywords"))
pub_tabularize(res)
#>                   doi                                          title
#> 1 10.7554/eLife.03032 MicroRNA-mediated repression of nonsense mRNAs
#> 2 10.7554/eLife.03032 MicroRNA-mediated repression of nonsense mRNAs
#> 3 10.7554/eLife.03032 MicroRNA-mediated repression of nonsense mRNAs
#> 4 10.7554/eLife.03032 MicroRNA-mediated repression of nonsense mRNAs
#> 5 10.7554/eLife.03032 MicroRNA-mediated repression of nonsense mRNAs
#> 6 10.7554/eLife.03032 MicroRNA-mediated repression of nonsense mRNAs
#>                       keywords .publisher
#> 1                     microRNA      elife
#> 2            nonsense mutation      elife
#> 3 nonsense-mediated mRNA decay      elife
#> 4                          APC      elife
#> 5             intron retention      elife
#> 6  premature termination codon      elife
```

## Get a random XML article


```r
library(rcrossref)
library(dplyr)

res <- cr_works(filter = list(
    full_text_type = "application/xml", 
    license_url="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"))
links <- bind_rows(res$data$link) %>% filter(content.type == "application/xml")
download.file(links$URL[1], (i <- tempfile(fileext = ".xml")))
pub_chunks(i)
#> <pub chunks>

#>   publisher/journal: unknown/NA
#>   sections: all
#>   showing up to first 5:

pubchunks 0.4.0
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* `pub_chunks()` gains new parameter `extract` to determine the final step of extracting text from XML format articles - use either `as.character()` or `xml2::xml_text()` (#11)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* fix to `sections="aff"` in `pub_chunks()` - keep all rows in merging data from different affilitation metadata parts to not lose any data (#7)


pubchunks 0.3.0
===============

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* improvements to `pub_chunks()` with `sections="refs"` (fetching references from an article). all reference extraction was simply extracting the entire reference, which lost all white space. now there are custom reference parsers for the various types of reference formats. there still are outstanding issues, so do please point out where ref. extraction is not correct (#2)
* fix pub_guess_publisher examples error (#10)

pubchunks 0.2.2
===============

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* fixed failing example (#9)

pubchunks 0.2.0
===============

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* most section options in `pub_chunks()` now have defaults for extracting the section, and return NULL/empty list when not found (#3) (#4)
* improvements to `print.pub_chunks` so that the printed object contains more information (publisher/journal title) and more accurate ('character' used to include xml as character string and file paths, but are separated now). in addition, we state that the first 5 sections are printed so the user knows there could be more (#8)
* fix `pub_tabularize()` to accept list outputs from `pub_chunks()` (#5)

pubchunks 0.1.0
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* released to CRAN
## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 4.0.3
* ubuntu 16.04 (on GitHub Actions), R 4.0.3
* win-builder (devel and release)
