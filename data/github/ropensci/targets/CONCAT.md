The `targets` package is a
[Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)-like pipeline toolkit for
Statistics and data science in R. With `targets`, you can maintain a
reproducible workflow without repeating yourself. `targets` skips costly
runtime for tasks that are already up to date, runs the necessary
computation with implicit parallel computing, and abstracts files as R
objects. A fully up-to-date `targets` pipeline is tangible evidence that
the output aligns with the code and data, which substantiates trust in
the results.

## Prerequisites

# targets 0.10.0.9000

## New features

* Implement `tar_assert_finite()`.
* Report the total runtime of the pipeline in the `"verbose"`, `"verbose_positives"`, `"timestamp"`, and `"timesamp_positives"` reporters.
* Add a `zoom_speed` argument to `tar_visnetwork()` and `tar_glimpse()` (#749, @dipterix).

# targets 0.10.0

## Bug fixes

* Add class `"tar_nonexportable"` to `format = "aws_keras"` and `format = "aws_torch"` stores.
* Export S3 methods of generic `tar_make_interactive_load_target()`.

## New features

* Allow entirely custom storage formats through `tar_target(format = tar_format(...))` (#736).
* Add a new function `tar_call()` to return the `targets` function currently running (from `_targets.R` or a target).
* Add a new function `tar_active()` to tell whether the pipeline is currently running. Detects if it is called from `tar_make()` or similar function.

## Enhancements

* Add `Sys.getenv("TAR_PROJECT")` to the output of `tar_envvars()`.
* Set the `store` field of `tar_runtime` prior to sourcing `_targets.R` so `tar_store()` works in target scripts.
* Explicitly export all the environment variables from `tar_envvars()` to targets run on parallel workers.
* Allow `format = "file"` targets to return `character(0)` (#728, @programLyrique).
* Automatically remove non-targets from the target list and improve target list error messages (#731, @billdenney).
* Link to resources on deploying to RStudio Connect (#745, @ian-flores).

# targets 0.9.1

* Mask pointers in function dependencies (#721, @matthiaskaeding)

# targets 0.9.0

## Highlights

* Track the version ID of AWS S3-backed targets if the bucket is version-enabled (#711). If you put your targets in AWS and the metadata and code under version control, you can `git checkout` a different branch of your code and all you targets will stay up to date.
* Refactor the AWS path format internally. It now consists of arbitrarily extensible key-value pairs so more AWS S3 functionality may be added more seamlessly going forward (#711).
* Switch the AWS S3 backend to `paws` (#711).

## New features

* Add a `region` argument to `tar_resources_aws()` to allow the user to explicitly declare a region for each AWS S3 buckets (@caewok, #681). Different buckets can now have different regions. This feature required modifying the metadata path for AWS storage formats. Before, the first element of the path was simply the bucket name. Now, it is internally formatted like `"bucket=BUCKET:region=REGION"`, where `BUCKET` is the user-supplied bucket name and `REGION` is the user-supplied region name. The new `targets` is back-compatible with the old metadata format, but if you run the pipeline with `targets` >= 0.8.1.9000 and then downgrade to `targets` <= 0.8.1, any AWS targets will break.
* Add new reporters `timestamp_positives"` and `"verbose_positives"` that omit messages for skipped targets (@psanker, #683).
* Implement `tar_assert_file()`.
* Implement `tar_reprex()` for creating easier reproducible examples of pipelines.
* Implement `tar_store()` to get the path to the store of the currently running pipeline (#714, @MilesMcBain).
* Automatically write a `_targets/user/` folder to encourage `gittargets` users to put custom files there for data version control.

## Bug fixes

* Make sure `tar_path()` uses the current store path of the currently running pipeline instead of `tar_config_get("store")` (#714, @MilesMcBain).

## Enhancements

* Refactor the automatic `.gitignore` file inside the data store to allow the metadata to be committed to version control more easily (#685, #711).
* Document target name requirements in `tar_target()` and `tar_target_raw()` (@tjmahr, #679).
* Catch and relay any the error if a target cannot be checked in `target_should_run.tar_builder()`. These kinds of errors sometimes come up with AWS storage.
* Fix the documentation of the reporters.
* Only write `_targets/.gitignore` for new data stores so the user can delete the `.gitignore` file without it mysteriously reappearing (#685).

# targets 0.8.1

## New features

* Add arguments `strict` and `silent` to allow `tar_load()` and `tar_load_raw()` to bypass targets that cannot be loaded.

## Enhancements

* Improve `tidyselect` docs in `tar_make()` (#640, @dewoller).
* Use namespaced call to `tar_dir()` in `tar_test()` (#642, @billdenney).
* Improve `tar_assert_target_list()` error message (@kkami1115, #654).
* Throw an informative error if a target name starts with a dot (@dipterix, #662).
* Improve help files of `tar_destroy()` and related cleanup functions (@billdenney, #675).

# targets 0.8.0

## Bug fixes

* Hash the correct files in `tar_target(target_name, ..., format = "aws_file")`. Previously, `_targets/objects/target_name` was also hashed if it existed.

## New features

* Implement a new `tar_config_unset()` function to delete one or more configuration settings from the YAML configuration file.
* Implement the `TAR_CONFIG` environment variable to set the default file path of the YAML configuration file with project settings (#622, @yyzeng, @atusy, @nsheff, @wdkrnls). If `TAR_CONFIG` is not set, the file path is still `_targets.yaml`.
* Restructure the YAML configuration file format to handle configuration information for multiple projects (using the `config` package) and support the `TAR_PROJECT` environment variable to select the current active project for a given R session. The old single-project format is gracefully deprecated (#622, @yyzeng, @atusy, @nsheff, @wdkrnls).
* Implement `retrieval = "none"` and `storage = "none"` to anticipate loading/saving targets from other languages, e.g. Julia (@MilesMcBain).
* Add a new `tar_definition()` function to get the target definition object of the current target while that target is running in a pipeline.
* If called inside an AWS target, `tar_path()` now returns the path to the staging file instead of `_targets/objects/target_name`. This ensures you can still write to `tar_path()` in `storage = "none"` targets and the package will automatically hash the right file and upload it to the cloud. (This behavior does not apply to formats `"file"` and `"aws_file"`, where it is never necessary to set `storage = "none"`.)

## Enhancements

* Use `eval(parse(text = ...), envir = tar_option_set("envir")` instead of `source()` in the `_targets.R` file for Target Markdown.
* Allow feather and parquet formats to accept objects of class `RecordBatch` and `Table` (@MilesMcBain).
* Let `knitr` load the Target Markdown engine (#469, @nviets, @yihui). Minimum `knitr` version is now `1.34`.
* In the `tar_resources_future()` help file, encourage the use of `plan` to specify resources.

# targets 0.7.0

## Bug fixes

* Ensure `error = "continue"` does not cause errored targets to have `NULL` values.
* Relay output and messages in Target Markdown interactive mode (using the R/default `knitr` engine).

## New features

* Expose the `poll_connection`, `stdout`, and `stderr` arguments of `callr::r_bg()` in `tar_watch()` (@mpadge).
* Add new helper functions to list targets in each progress category: `tar_started()`, `tar_skipped()`, `tar_built()`, `tar_canceled()`, and `tar_errored()`.
* Add new helper functions `tar_interactive()`, `tar_noninteractive()`, and `tar_toggle()` to differentially suppress code in non-interactive and interactive mode in Target Markdown (#607, @33Vito).

## Enhancements

* Handle `future` errors within targets (#570, @stuvet).
* Handle storage errors within targets (#571, @stuvet).
* In Target Markdown in non-interactive mode, suppress messages if the `message` `knitr` chunk option is `FALSE` (#574, @jmbuhr).
* In Target Markdown, if `tar_interactive` is not set, choose interactive vs non-interactive mode based on `isTRUE(getOption("knitr.in.progress"))` instead of `interactive()`.
* Convert errors loading dependencies into errors running targets (@stuvet).

# targets 0.6.0

## Bug fixes

* Allow `tar_poll()` to lose and then regain connection to the progress file.
* Make sure changes to the `tar_group` column of `iteration = "group"` data frames do not invalidate slices (#507, @lindsayplatt).

## New features

* In Target Markdown, add a new `tar_interactive` global option to select interactive mode or non-interactive mode (#469).
* Highlight a graph neighborhood when the user clicks a node. Control the neighborhood degree with new arguments `degree_from` and `degree_to` of `tar_visnetwork()` and `tar_glimpse()` (#474, @rgayler).
* Make the target script path configurable in `tar_config_set()` (#476).
* Add a `tar_script` chunk option in Target Markdown to control where the `{targets}` language engine writes the target script and helper scripts (#478).
* Add new arguments `script` and `store` to choose custom paths to the target script file and data store for individual function calls (#477).
* Allow users to set an alternative path to the YAML configuration file for the current R session (#477). Most users have no reason to set this path, it is only for niche applications like Shiny apps with `targets` backends. Unavoidably, the path gets reset to `_targets.yaml` when the session restarts.
* Add new `_targets.yaml` config options `reporter_make`, `reporter_outdated`, and `workers` to control function argument defaults shared across multiple functions called outside `_targets.R` (#498, @ianeveperry).
* Add `tar_load_globals()` for debugging, testing, prototyping, and teaching (#496, @malcolmbarrett).
* Add structure to the `resources` argument of `tar_target()` to avoid conflicts among formats and HPC backends (#489). Includes user-side helper functions like `tar_resources()` and `tar_resources_aws()` to build the required data structures.
* Log skipped targets in `_targets/meta/progress` and display then in `tar_progress()`, `tar_poll()`, `tar_watch()`, `tar_progress_branches()`, `tar_progress_summary()`, and `tar_visnetwork()` (#514). Instead of writing each skip line separately to `_targets/meta/progress`, accumulate skip lines in a queue and then write them all out in bulk when something interesting happens. This avoids a lot of overhead in certain cases.
* Add a `shortcut` argument to `tar_make()`, `tar_make_clustermq()`, `tar_make_future()`, `tar_outdated()`, and `tar_sitrep()` to more efficiently skip parts of the pipeline (#522, #523, @jennysjaarda, @MilesMcBain, @kendonB).
* Support `names` and `shortcut` in graph data frames and graph visuals (#529).
* Move `allow` and `exclude` to the network behind the graph visuals rather than the visuals themselves (#529).
* Add a new "progress" display to the `tar_watch()` app to show verbose progress info and metadata.
* Add a new `workspace_on_error` argument of `tar_option_set()` to supersede `error = "workspace"`. Helps control workspace behavior independently of the `error` argument of `tar_target()` (#405, #533, #534, @mattwarkentin, @xinstein).
* Implement `error = "abridge"` in `tar_target()` and related functions. If a target errors out with this option, the target itself stops, any currently running targets keeps, and no new targets launch after that (#533, #534, @xinstein).
* Add a menu prompt to `tar_destroy()` which can be suppressed with `TAR_ASK = "false"` (#542, @gofford).
* Support functions `tar_older()` and `tar_newer()` to help users identify and invalidate targets at regular times or intervals.

## Deprecations

* In Target Markdown, deprecate the `targets` chunk option in favor of `tar_globals` (#469).
* Deprecate `error = "workspace"` in `tar_target()` and related functions. Use `tar_option_set(workspace_on_error = TRUE)` instead (#405, #533, @mattwarkentin, @xinstein).

## Performance

* Reset the backoff upper bound when concluding a target or shutting down a `clustermq` worker (@rich-payne).
* Set more aggressive default backoff bound of 0.1 seconds (previous: 5 seconds) and set a more aggressive minimum of 0.001 seconds (previous: 0.01 seconds) (@rich-payne).
* Speed up the summary and forecast reporters by only printing to the console every quarter second.
* Avoid superfluous calls to `store_sync_file_meta.default()` on small files.
* In `tar_watch()`, take several measures to avoid long computation times rendering the graph:
    * Expose arguments `display` and `displays` to `tar_watch()` so the user can select which display shows first.
    * Make `"summary"` the default display instead of `"graph"`.
    * Set `outdated` to `FALSE` by default.

## Enhancements

* Simplify the Target Markdown example.
* Warn about unnamed chunks in Target Markdown.
* Redesign option system to be more object-oriented and rigorous. Also export most options to HPC workers (#475).
* Simplify config system to let API function arguments take control (#483).
* In `tar_read()` for targets with `format = "aws_file"`, download the file back to the path the user originally saved it when the target ran.
* Replace the `TAR_MAKE_REPORTER` environment variable with `targets::tar_config_get("reporter_make")`.
* Use `eval(parse(text = readLines("_targets.R")), envir = some_envir)` and related techniques instead of the less controllable `source()`. Expose an `envir` argument to many functions for further control over evaluation if `callr_function` is `NULL`.
* Drop `out.attrs` when hashing groups of data frames to extend #507 to `expand.grid()` (#508).
* Increase the number of characters in errors and warnings up to 2048.
* Refactor assertions to automatically generate better messages.
* Export assertions, conditions, and language utilities in packages that build on top of `targets`.
* Change `GITHUBPAT` to `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the `tar_github_actions()` YAML file (#554, @eveyp).
* Support the `eval` chunk option in Target Markdown (#552, @fkohrt).
* Record time stamps in the metadata `time` column for all builder targets, regardless of storage format.

# targets 0.5.0

## Bug fixes

* Export in-memory config settings from `_targets.yaml` to parallel workers.

## New features

* Add a limited-scope `exclude` argument to `tar_watch()` and `tar_watch_server()` (#458, @gorkang).
* Write a `.gitignore` file to ignore everything in `_targets/meta/` except `.gitignore` and `_targets/meta/meta`.
* Target Markdown: add `knitr` engines for pipeline construction and prototyping from within literate programming documents (#469, @cderv, @nviets, @emilyriederer, @ijlyttle, @GShotwell, @gadenbuie, @tomsing1). Huge thanks to @cderv on this one for answering my deluge of questions, helping me figure out what was and was not possible in `knitr`, and ultimately circling me back to a successful approach.
* Add an RStudio R Markdown template for Target Markdown (#469).
* Implement `use_targets()`, which writes the Target Markdown template to the project root (#469).
* Implement `tar_unscript()` to clean up scripts written by Target Markdown.

## Enhancements

* Enable priorities in `tar_make()` and `tar_manifest()`.
* Show the priority in the print method of stem and pattern targets.
* Throw informative errors if the secondary arguments to `pattern = slice()` or `pattern = sample()` are invalid.
* In `tar_target_raw()`, assert that commands have length 1 when converted to expressions.
* Handle errors and post failure artifacts in the Github Actions YAML file.
* Rewrite the documentation on invalidation rules in `tar_cue()` (@maelle).
* Drop `dplyr` groups and `"grouped_df"` class in `tar_group()` (`tarchetypes` discussion #53, @kendonB).
* Assign branch names to dynamic branching return values produced by `tar_read()` and `tar_read_raw()`.

# targets 0.4.2

## Bug fixes

* Do not use time stamps to monitor the config file (e.g. `_targets.yaml`). Fixes CRAN check errors from version 0.4.1.

# targets 0.4.1

* Fix CRAN test error on Windows R-devel.
* Do not inherit `roxygen2` docstrings from `shiny`.
* Handle more missing `Suggests:` packages.
* Unset the config lock before reading `targets.yaml` in the `callr` process.

# targets 0.4.0

## Bug fixes

* Avoid `file.rename()` errors when migrating staged temporary files (#410).
* Return correct error messages from feather and parquet formats (#388). Now calling `assert_df()` from `store_assert_format()` instead of `store_cast_object()`. And now those last two functions are not called at all if the target throws an error.
* Retry writing lines to database files so Windows machines can run `tar_poll()` at the same time as the pipeline (#393).
* Rename file written by `tar_renv()` to `_targets_packages.R` (#397).
* Ensure metadata is loaded to compute labels properly when `outdated = FALSE` in `tar_visnetwork()`.

## New features

* Implement `tar_timestamp()` and `tar_timestamp_raw()` to get the last modified timestamp of a target's data (#378).
* Implement `tar_progress_summary()` to compactly summarize all pipeline progress (#380).
* Add a `characters` argument of `tar_traceback()` to cap the traceback line lengths (#383).
* Add new "summary" and "about" views to `tar_watch()` (#382).
* Implement `tar_poll()` to repeatedly poll runtime progress in the R console (#381). `tar_poll()` is a lightweight alternative to `tar_watch()`.
* Change the color of the "dormant" status in the graph.
* Add a `tar_envvar()` function to list values of special environment variables supported in `targets`. The help file explains each environment variable in detail.
* Support extra project-level configuration settings with `_targets.yaml` (#297). New functions `tar_config_get()` and `tar_config_set()` interact with the `_targets.yaml` file. Currently only supports the `store` field to set the data store path to something other than `_targets/`.

## Performance

* Shut down superfluous persistent workers earlier in dynamic branching and when all remaining targets have `deployment = "main"` (#398, #399, #404, @pat-s).

## Enhancements

* Attempt to print only the useful part of the traceback in `tar_traceback()` (#383).
* Add a line break at the end of the "summary" reporter so warnings do not mangle the output.
* In `tar_watch()`, use `shinybusy` instead of `shinycssloaders` and keep current output on display while new output is rendering (#386, @rcorty).
* Right-align the headers and counts in the "summary" and "forecast" reporters.
* Add a timestamp to the "summary" reporter.
* Make the reporters show when a target ends (#391, @mattwarkentin).
* Make the reporters show when a pattern ends if the pattern built at least one target and none of the targets errored or canceled.
* Use words "start" and "built" in reporters.
* Use the region of the AWS S3 bucket instead of the local `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable (`check_region = TRUE`; #400, @tomsing1).
* In `tar_meta()`, return `POSIXct` times in the time zone of the calling system (#131).
* Throw informative error messages when a target's name or command is missing (#413, @liutiming).
* Bring back ALTREP in `qs::qread()` now that `qs` 0.24.1 requires `stringfish` >= 1.5.0 (#147, @glep).
* Relax dynamic branching checks so `pattern = slice(...)` can take multiple indexes (#406, #419, @djbirke, @alexgphayes)

# targets 0.3.1

## Bug fixes

* `queue$enqueue()` is now `queue$prepend()` and always appends to the front of the queue (#371).

## Enhancements

* Throw a warning if `devtools::load_all()` or similar is detected inside `_targets.R` (#374).

## CRAN

* Skip `feather` and `parquet` tests on CRAN.

# targets 0.3.0

## Bug fixes

* Fix the "write target at cursor" RStudio addin and move cursor between the parentheses.

## New features

* Add a `backoff` option in `tar_option_set()` to set the maximum upper bound (seconds) for the polling interval (#333).
* Add a new `tar_github_actions()` function to write a GitHub Actions workflow file for continuous deployment of data analysis pipelines (#339, @jaredlander).
* Add a new `TAR_MAKE_REPORTER` environment variable to globally set the reporter of the `tar_make*()` functions (#345, @alexpghayes).
* Support new storage formats "feather", "parquet", "aws_feather", and "aws_parquet" (#355, @riazarbi).

## Performance

* Implement an exponential backoff algorithm for polling the priority queue in `tar_make_clustermq()` and `tar_make_future()` (#333). 
* In `tar_make_future()`, try to submit a target every time a worker is polled.
* In `tar_make_future()`, poll workers in order of target priority.
* Avoid the time delay in exiting on error (from https://github.com/r-lib/callr/issues/185).
* Clone target objects for the pipeline and scrape more `targets` internal objects out of the environment in order to avoid accidental massive data transfers to workers.

## Enhancements

* Use `rlang::check_installed()` inside `assert_package()` (#331, @malcolmbarrett).
* Allow `tar_destroy(destroy = "process")`.
* In `tar_watch()`, increase default `seconds` to 15 (previously 5).
* In `tar_watch()`, debounce instead of throttle inputs.
* In `tar_watch()`, add an action button to refresh the outputs.
* Always deduplicate metadata after `tar_make()`. Will help compute a cache key on GitHub Actions and similar services.
* Deprecate `tar_deduplicate()` due to the item above.
* Reorder information in timestamped messages.
* Document RNG seed generation in `tar_target_raw()`, `tar_meta()`, and `tar_seed()` (#357, @alexpghayes).
* Switch meaning of `%||%` and `%|||%` to conform to historical precedent.
* Only show a command line spinner if `reporter = "silent"` (#364, @matthiasgomolka).
* Target and pipeline objects no longer have an `envir` element.

# targets 0.2.0

## Bug fixes

* In `tar_load()`, subset metadata to avoid accidental attempts to load global objects in `tidyselect` calls.
* Do not register a pattern as running unless an actual branch is about to start (#304).
* Use a name spec in `vctrs::vec_c()` (#320, @joelnitta).

## New features

* Add a new `names` argument to `tar_objects()` and `tar_workspaces()` with `tidyselect` functionality.
* Record info on the main process (PID, R version, `targets` version) in `_targets/meta/process` and write new functions `tar_process()` and `tar_pid()` to retrieve the data (#291, #292).
* Add a new `targets_only` argument to `tar_meta()`.
* Add new functions `tar_helper()` and `tar_helper_raw()` to write general-purpose R scripts, using tidy evaluation for as a template mechanism (#290, #291, #292, #306).
* Export functions to check the existence of various pieces of local storage: `tar_exist_meta()`, `tar_exist_objects()`, `tar_exist_progress()`, `tar_exist_progress()`, `tar_exist_script()` (#310).
* Add a new `supervise` argument to `tar_watch()`.
* Add a new `complete_only` argument to `tar_meta()` to optionally return only complete rows (no `NA` values).
* Catch `callr` errors and refer users to the debugging chapter of the manual.

## Enhancements

* Improve error messages of invalid arguments (#298, @brunocarlin). Removes partial argument matching in most cases.
* By default, locally enable `crayon` if an only if the calling process is interactive (#302, @ginolhac). Can still be disabled with `options(crayon.enabled = FALSE)` in `_targets.R`.
* Improve error handling and message for `format = "url"` when the HTTP response status code is not 200 (#303, @petrbouchal).
* Add more `extras` packages to `tar_renv()` (to support `tar_watch()`).
* Show informative message instead of error in `tar_watch()` if `_targets.R` does not exist.
* Clear up the documentation of the `names` argument of `tar_load()` (#314, @jameelalsalam).
* Do not override `nobody` in custom `curl` handles (#315, @riazarbi).
* Rename "running" to "started" in the progress metadata. This avoids the implicit claim that `targets` is somehow actively monitoring each job, e.g. through a connection or heartbeat (#318).
* Set `errormode = "warn"` in `getVDigest()` for files to work around https://github.com/eddelbuettel/digest/issues/49 for network drives on Windows. `targets` already runs those file checks anyway. (#316, @boshek).
* If a package fails to load, print the library paths `targets` tried to load from.

# targets 0.1.0

## Bug fixes

* `tar_test()` now skips all tests on Solaris in order to fix the problems shown on the CRAN check page.
* Enable `allow` and `exclude` to work on imports in `tar_visnetwork()` and `tar_glimpse()`.
* Put `visNetwork` legends on right to avoid crowding the graph.

## Performance

* Call `force()` on subpipeline objects to eliminate high-memory promises in target objects. Allows targets to be deployed to workers much faster when `retreival` is `"main"` (#279).

## New features

* Add a new box to the `tar_watch()` app to tabulate progress on dynamic branches (#273, @mattwarkentin).
* Store `type`, `parent`, and `branches` in progress data for `tar_watch()` (#273, @mattwarkentin).
* Add a `fields` argument in `tar_progress()` and default to `"progress"` for back compatibility (#273, @mattwarkentin).
* Add a new `tar_progress_branches()` function to tabulate branch progress (#273, @mattwarkentin).
* Add new "refresh" switch to `tar_watch()` to toggle automatic refreshing and force a refresh.

## Enhancements

* Exclude `.Random.seed` by default in `tar_visnetwork()`.
* Spelling: "cancelled" changed to "canceled".
* Enhance controls and use of space in the `tar_watch()` app.
* Centralize internal path management utilities.

## Configuration

* Skip `clustermq` tests on Solaris.

# targets 0.0.2

## CRAN response

* Avoid starting the description with the package name.
* Remove `if(FALSE)` blocks from help files to fix "unexecutable code" warnings (`tar_glimpse()`, `tar_visnetwork()`, and `tar_watch()`).
* Remove commented code in the examples (`tar_edit()`, `tar_watch_ui()`, and `tar_watch_server()`).
* Ensure that all examples, tests, and vignettes do not write to the user's home file space. (Fixed an example of `tar_workspace()`.)

## Enhancements

* Use JOSS paper in `CITATION`.

# targets 0.0.1

## Enhancements

* Accept lists of target objects at the end of `_targets.R` (#253).
* Deprecate `tar_pipeline()` and `tar_bind()` because of the above (#253).
* Always show a special message when the pipeline finishes (#258, @petrbouchal).
* Disable `visNetwork` stabilization (#264, @mattwarkentin).
* Use default `visNetwork` font size.
* Relay errors as condition messages if `error` is `"continue"` (#267, @liutiming).

# targets 0.0.0.9003

## Bug fixes

* Ensure pattern-only pipelines can be defined so they can be combined again later with `tar_bind()` (#245, @yonicd).
* Implement safeguards around `igraph` topological sort.

## Enhancements

* Topologically sort the rows of `tar_manifest()` (#263, @sctyner).

## Breaking changes

* Make patterns composable (#212, @glep, @djbirke).
* Allow workspaces to load nonexportable objects (#214).
* Make workspace files super light by saving only a reference to the required dependencies (#214).
* Add a new `workspaces` argument to `tar_option_set()` to specify which targets will save their workspace files during `tar_make()` (#214).
* Change `error = "save"` to `error = "workspace"` to so it is clearer that saving workspaces no longer duplicates data (#214).
* Rename `what` to `destroy` in `tar_destroy()`.
* Remove `tar_undebug()` because is redundant with `tar_destroy(destroy = "workspaces")`.

## New features

* Make patterns composable (#212).
* Add new dynamic branching patterns `head()`, `tail()`, and `sample()` to provide functionality equivalent to `drake`'s `max_expand` (#56).
* Add a new `tar_pattern()` function to emulate dynamic branching outside a pipeline.
* Add a new `level_separation` argument to `tar_visnetwork()` and `tar_glimpse()` to control the aspect ratio (#226).
* Track functions from multiple packages with the `imports` argument to `tar_option_set()` (#239).
* Add color for "built" progress if `outdated` is `FALSE` in `tar_visnetwork()`.
* Tweak colors in `tar_visnetwork()` to try to account for color blindness.

## Enhancements

* Return full patterns from `tar_manifest()`.
* Record package load errors in progress and metadata (#228, @psychelzh).
* `tar_renv()` now invokes `_targets.R` through a background process just like `tar_outdated()` etc. so it can account for more hidden packages (#224, @mattwarkentin).
* Set `deployment` equal to `"main"` for all targets in `tar_make()`. This ensures `tar_make()` does not waste time waiting for nonexistent files to ship over a nonexistent network file system (NFS). `tar_make_clustermq()` or `tar_make_future()` could use NFS, so they still leave `deployment` alone.

# targets 0.0.0.9002

## Breaking changes

* Add a new `size` field to the metadata to allow `targets` to make better judgments about when to rehash files (#180). We now compare hashes to check file size differences instead of doing messy floating point comparisons with ad hoc tolerances. It breaks back compatibility with old projects, but the error message is informative, and this is all still before the first official release.
* Change "local" to "main" and "remote" to "worker" in the `storage`, `retrieval`, and `deployment` settings (#183, @mattwarkentin).
* Ensure function dependencies are sorted before computing the function hash (GitHub commit f15face7d72c15c2d1098da959492bdbfcddb425).
* Move `garbage_collection` to a target-level setting, i.e. argument to `tar_target()` and `tar_option_set()` (#194). Previously was an argument to the `tar_make*()` functions.
* Allow `tar_name()` and `tar_path()` to run outside the pipeline with debugging-friendly default return values.

## Bug fixes

* Stop sending target return values over the network when `storage` is `"remote"` (#182, @mattwarkentin).
* Shorten lengths of warnings and error messages to 128 characters (#186, @gorkang).
* Restrict in-memory metadata to avoid incorrectly recycling deleted targets (#191).
* Marshal nonexportable dependencies before sending them to workers. Transport data through `target$subpipeline` rather than `target$cache` to make that happen (#209, @mattwarkentin).

## New features

* Add a new function `tar_bind()` to combine pipeline objects.
* Add `tar_seed()` to get the random number generator seed of the target currently running.

## Enhancements

* Allow target-specific `future::plan()`s through the `resources` argument of `tar_target()` (#198, @mattwarkentin).
* Use `library()` instead of `require()` in `command_load_packages()`.
* Evaluate commands directly in `targets$cache$targets$envir` to improve convenience in interactive debugging (`ls()` just works now.) This is reasonably safe now that the cache is populated at the last minute and cleared as soon as possible (#209, #210).

# targets 0.0.0.9000

* First version.
# Contributing

Development is a community effort, and we welcome participation.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that this package is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/). 

## Discussions

At <https://github.com/ropensci/targets/discussions>, you can post general questions, brainstorm ideas, and ask for help.

## Issues

<https://github.com/ropensci/targets/issues> is for bug reports, performance issues, maintenance tasks, and feature requests. When you post, please abide by the following guidelines.

* Before posting a new issue or discussion topic, please take a moment to search for existing similar threads in order to avoid duplication.
* For bug reports: if you can, please install the latest GitHub version of `targets` (i.e. `remotes::install_github("ropensci/targets")`) and verify that the issue still persists.
* Describe your issue in prose as clearly and concisely as possible.
* For any problem you identify, post a [minimal reproducible example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) like [this one](https://github.com/ropensci/targets/issues/256#issuecomment-754229683) so the maintainer can troubleshoot. A reproducible example is:
    * **Runnable**: post enough R code and data so any onlooker can create the error on their own computer.
    * **Minimal**: reduce runtime wherever possible and remove complicated details that are irrelevant to the issue at hand.
    * **Readable**: format your code according to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).

## Development

External code contributions are extremely helpful in the right circumstances. Here are the recommended steps.

1. Prior to contribution, please propose your idea in a discussion topic or issue thread so you and the maintainer can define the intent and scope of your work.
2. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
3. Follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) to create a new branch, add commits, and open a pull request.
4. Discuss your code with the maintainer in the pull request thread.
5. If everything looks good, the maintainer will merge your code into the project.

Please also follow these additional guidelines.

* Respect the architecture and reasoning of the package. Depending on the scope of your work, you may want to read the design documents (package vignettes).
* If possible, keep contributions small enough to easily review manually. It is okay to split up your work into multiple pull requests.
* Format your code according to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) and check your formatting with the `lint_package()` function from the [`lintr`](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) package.
* For new features or functionality, add tests in `tests`. Tests that can be automated should go in `tests/testthat/`. Tests that cannot be automated should go in `tests/interactive/`. For features affecting performance, it is good practice to add profiling studies to `tests/performance/`.
* Check code coverage with `covr::package_coverage()`. Automated tests should cover all the new or changed functionality in your pull request.
* Run overall package checks with `devtools::check()` and `goodpractice::gp()`
* Describe your contribution in the project's [`NEWS.md`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets/blob/main/NEWS.md) file. Be sure to mention relevent GitHub issue numbers and your GitHub name as done in existing news entries.
* If you feel contribution is substantial enough for official author or contributor status, please add yourself to the `Authors@R` field of the [`DESCRIPTION`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets/blob/main/DESCRIPTION) file.

# Summary

The [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) R package [@targets] is a pipeline toolkit for computationally intense reproducible research. It reduces the time and effort required to develop a data analysis project and maintain a trustworthy set of results. [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) uses static code analysis to detect dependency relationships among interconnected computational tasks and construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which researchers can visualize in order to understand and communicate the structure of a complicated workflow. To run the pipeline at scale, [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) leverages implicit parallel computing and optional cloud storage. In subsequent runs, [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets), skips tasks that are already synchronized with their upstream dependencies, which not only reduces the runtime of rapidly developing workflows, but also provides tangible evidence of reproducibility.

In high-performance computing scenarios, [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) uses its DAG to discern which targets can run concurrently and which targets are still waiting for other upstream targets to finish processing. As soon as a target's dependency requirements are met, the target is deployed to the next available parallel worker. Internally, [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) leverages the [`clustermq`](https://github.com/mschubert/clustermq) package [@clustermq] for persistent workers and the  [`future`](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future) package [@future] for transient workers. Both [`clustermq`](https://github.com/mschubert/clustermq) and [`future`](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future) are powerful and versatile frameworks capable of submitting R workloads not only to multiple cores on a single machine, but also to popular resource managers on shared computing clusters.

[`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) is the successor to [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) [@drake], which in turn originated from [`remake`](https://github.com/richfitz/remake) [@remake], an R package modeled after GNU Make [@Make]. Unlike Make, [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) and [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) and [`remake`](https://github.com/richfitz/remake) focus on the R language, encourage an idiomatic function-oriented style of programming, and abstract each target as an R object. Relative to [`remake`](https://github.com/richfitz/remake) and  [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake), [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) is friendlier and more efficient, surpassing the permanent architectural limitations of both predecessors. The data storage system of [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) is lighter and more transparent, which helps users diagnose issues, move projects to different file systems, work with multiple contributors, and leverage seamless [Metaflow](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow)-like cloud storage integration [@metaflow]. In addition,  [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) supports stronger user-side guardrails, more introspective dependency graph visualizations, parallel efficient dynamic branching, and an interface more amenable to metaprogramming and third-party extensions.

# References
The `tar_watch()` app visualizes the status and progress of a `targets` pipeline. 

## Views

* __summary__: overall runtime progress summary of the pipeline. In the table, the "time" column shows the last time a target started, finished, errored, or canceled itself. The "since" columns shows how long ago that was.
* __branches__: like the summary view except with specific information about dynamic branching progress.
* __progress__: a large searchable table of progress information and metadata.
* __graph__: show the `tar_visnetwork()` dependency graph. If this graph may be slow to refresh, consider toggling the outdated switch, speeding up your `_targets.R` file, or selecting another view.

## Controls

* __refresh__: click this button to force the displays in the app to refresh.
* __watch__: toggle whether the app refreshes automatically every few seconds.
* __targets_only__: whether to show only the targets or also show functions and other global objects.
* __outdated__: whether to color-code nodes depending on whether they are up to date. This feature may cause if the number of targets is enormous, so you may consider turning it off to just color by runtime progress in some cases.
* __label__: labels to append to the node names to optionally show the size, runtime, and number of branches of targets based on past recorded info in the metadata.
* __seconds__: how often to refresh the displays in the app when the "watch" switch is turned on.
* __level_separation__: how wide the graph should be.
