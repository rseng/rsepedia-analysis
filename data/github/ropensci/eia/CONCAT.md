The `eia` package provides API access to data from the US [Energy
Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/) (EIA).

Pulling data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) API
requires a registered API key. A key can be obtained at no cost
[here](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/register.php). A valid email and
agreement to the API Terms of Service is required to obtain a key.

`eia` includes functions for searching EIA API data categories and
importing time series and geoset time series datasets. Datasets returned
by these functions are provided in a tidy format or alternatively in
more raw form. It also offers helper functions for working with EIA API
date strings and time formats and for inspecting different summaries of
series metadata. The package also provides control over API key storage
and caching of API request results.

## Installation

Install the CRAN release of `eia` with

``` r
install.packages("eia")
```

To install the development version from GitHub use

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ropensci/eia")
```

## Example

To begin, store your API key. You can place it somewhere like your
`.Renviron` file and never have to do anything with the key when you use
the package. You can set it with `eia_set_key` in your R session. You
can always pass it explicitly to the `key` argument of a function.

``` r
library(eia)

# not run
eia_set_key("yourkey") # set API key if not already set globally
```

Load a time series of net electricity generation.

``` r
id <- "ELEC.GEN.ALL-AK-99.A"
(d <- eia_series(id, n = 10))
#> # A tibble: 1 x 13
#>   series_id      name                       units        f     description                         copyright source                iso3166 geography start end   updated       data

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* This is an update release.
* This update includes a maintainer email address update.

Special note: This package is an API wrapper. The particular API requires users to use their own API key. I cannot run function examples or unit tests on CRAN, but all examples and unit tests run successfully in multiple other environments, on local and remote systems. Full test suite also runs on Travis-CI where I am able to import an encrypted key. API key-dependent vignettes are precompiled for CRAN.
