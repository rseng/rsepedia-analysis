CORE API R client

CORE API docs: https://core.ac.uk/docs/

rcoreoa docs: https://docs.ropensci.org/rcoreoa/

Get an API key at https://core.ac.uk/api-keys/register. You'll need one, 
so do this now if you haven't yet. Once you have the key, you can pass it 
into the `key` parameter, or as a much better option store your key as an 
environment variable with the name `CORE_KEY` or an R option as `core_key`. 
See `?Startup` for how to work with env vars and R options

rcoreoa 0.4.0
=============

### NEW FEATURES

* `core_articles_dedup()` function added for article deduplication (#23)

* package `hoardr` now used for managing file caching (#13)
* function `core_advanced_search()` gains support for the `language` filter (#16) thanks @chreman

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* support for passing in more than one journal/article/etc. identifier for `core_articles_pdf()`/`core_articles_history()` - already supported in other functions (#10)
* `overwrite` parameter was being ignored in `core_articles_pdf()`, now is passed on internally (#12)
* `parse` parameter dropped in `core_articles_pdf()`, only used internally (#11)
* Improved docs on how to get and use API keys (#14)
* Improve documentation about what a 404 error response means - that the thing reqeusted does not exist (#9)
