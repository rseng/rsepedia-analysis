__An easy interface to CouchDB from R__

Note: Check out [*R4couchdb*](https://github.com/wactbprot/R4CouchDB), another R
package to interact with CouchDB.

sofa docs: https://docs.ropensci.org/sofa/

## CouchDB versions

`sofa` works with CouchDB v2 and v3. See [the builds](https://github.com/ropensci/sofa/actions?query=workflow%3AR-check) for checks on various CouchDB versions.

## CouchDB Info

* Docs: <http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/index.html>
* Installation: <http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/install/index.html>

## Connect to CouchDB

This may be starting it on your terminal/shell

```sh
couchdb
```

Or opening the CouchDB app on your machine, or running it in Docker. Whatever it
is, start it up.

## Install sofa

From CRAN


```r
install.packages("sofa")
```

Development version from GitHub


```r
remotes::install_github("ropensci/sofa")
```


```r
library('sofa')
```

## Cushions

Cushions? What? Since it's couch we gotta use `cushions` somehow. `cushions` are a
connection class containing all connection info to a CouchDB instance.
See `?Cushion` for help.

As an example, connecting to a Cloudant couch:


```r
z <- Cushion$new(
  host = "stuff.cloudant.com",
  transport = 'https',
  port = NULL,
  user = 'foobar',
  pwd = 'things'
)
```

Break down of parameters:

* `host`: the base url, without the transport (`http`/`https`)
* `path`: context path that is appended to the end of the url
* `transport`: `http` or `https`
* `port`: The port to connect to. Default: 5984. For Cloudant, have to set to `NULL`
* `user`: User name for the service.
* `pwd`: Password for the service, if any.
* `headers`: headers to pass in all requests

If you call `Cushion$new()` with no arguments you get a cushion set up for local
use on your machine, with all defaults used.


```r
x <- Cushion$new()
```

Ping the server


```r
x$ping()
```

Nice, it's working.

sofa 0.4.0
==========

### NEW FEATURES

* new function `doc_upsert()`: updates an existing document or creates it if it doesn't yet exist (#69) work by @critichu

CouchDB v3 related changes

* made sure sofa works with v3; all examples/tests updated to use username/password  (#73)
* new function `db_bulk_get()` for the `/{db}/_bulk_get` route  (#73)
* fixed `design_search_many()`: in couch v2.2 and greater there's a new route `/{db}/_design/{ddoc}/_view/{view}/queries`, which is used in this fxn now instead of using the `/{db}/_design/{ddoc}/_view/{view}` route (#75)
* Cushion class gains new method `$version()` to get the CouchDB version you're using as a numeric (to enable progammatic couch version checking)
* `db_query()` changes: some new parameters added: `r`, `bookmark`, `update`, `stable`, `stale`, and `execution_stats` (#74)

### DEFUNCT

* `attach_get()` is now defunct, use `doc_attach_get()` (#76)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* added more tests (#61)
* `design_search()` now allows more possible values for start and end keys: `startkey_docid`, `start_key_doc_id`, `startkey`, `start_key`, `endkey_docid`, `end_key_doc_id`, `endkey`, `end_key` (#62)
* add title to vignettes (#71)
* for `docs_create()` internally support using user's setting for the R option `digits` to pass on to `jsonlite::toJSON` to control number of digits after decimal place (#66)

### BUG FIXES

* fixed authorization problems in `$ping()` method in Cushion; now separate `ping()` function calls `$ping()` method in Cushion (#72)

sofa 0.3.0
==========

### NEW FEATURES

* Gains new functions `db_index`, `db_index_create`, and `db_index_delete` 
for getting an index, creating one, and deleting one
* Gains function `design_search_many` to do many queries at once 
in a `POST` request (#56)
* `design_search` reworked to allow user to do a `GET` request or 
`POST` request depending on if they use `params` parameter or
`body` parameter - many parameters removed in the function 
definition, and are now to be passed to `params` or `body` (#56)
* `db_alldocs` gains new parameter `disk` to optionally
write data to disk instead of into the R session - should help
when data is very large (if disk is used fxn returns a file path) (#64)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* fix minor issues in vignette, and updated for working with CouchDB v2 and greater (#53) (#54) (#47)
* replace `httr` with `crul` for HTTP requests (#52)
* `design_copy` removed temporarily (#20) (#60)
* new issue and pull request template

### BUG FIXES

* Fix to docs for `design_search` (#57) thanks @michellymenezes
* Fix to `db_query` to make a single field passed to `fields` parameter
work (#63) thanks @gtumuluri
* Fix error in `doc_attach_get` (#58) thanks @gtumuluri


sofa 0.2.0
