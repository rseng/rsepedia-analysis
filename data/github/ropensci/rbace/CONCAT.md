Client for interacting with the Bielefeld Academic Search Engine API.

Docs: https://docs.ropensci.org/rbace/

BASE API docs: https://www.base-search.net/about/download/base_interface.pdf

Access: The BASE API is IP address AND user-agent (see note below) restricted. The user agent is set correctly if you use this package, but you still need to get your IP address(es) white-listed by BASE. Request access at: https://www.base-search.net/about/en/contact.php - Note: the BASE website has a search portal you can use from anywhere; it's just the API that is IP and user-agent restricted.

Terminology:

- an IP address is the numeric label identifying a computer or server. the IP address for a computer can change, e.g., if you connect to a VPN
- a user-agent is a string of text that identifies the software requesting data from a server (in this case BASE's API).
