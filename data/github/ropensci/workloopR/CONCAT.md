# Summary

The work loop technique [@Josephson:1985] is used in studies of muscle physiology to determine the mechanical work and power output of a muscle. After isolating and attaching the muscle of interest to a servo motor, the motor induces cyclical oscillations of length change to the muscle. An example length change trace is shown in Figure \ref{example-workloop} (blue; one cycle out of several). As this occurs, the muscle is stimulated (grey shading) either directly or via its supplying nerve and the force that is generated is recorded (red trace). Because mechanical work is the product of force and distance, plotting force against length change for a particular cycle yields a "work loop". Work generated during the muscle's shortening phase is considered positive work, whereas work during lengthening is negative. Accordingly, the area enclosed within a work loop is the net work produced during that cycle.

![An example work loop analysis pipeline. (Left) Raw traces are shown for one length change cycle in blue. Stimulation is shown in grey shading and muscle force generation is shown in red. (Right) Net work is calculated as the difference between work in the (Middle) shortening and lengthening phases.\label{example-workloop}](images/fig1_workloop.png)

Work loop procedures have powerful experimental value and have been used to understand the characteristics of whole muscles, fiber bundles, and/or single muscle fibers from a wide variety of organisms. Using experimental parameters (e.g., length change amplitude, frequency of stimulation) that correspond to those shown by an organism *in vivo* can help explain muscle performance in the context of natural behavior. But since these experimental parameters do not need to be constrained to those shown during *in vivo* behaviors, the work loop technique affords the ability to explore a muscle's properties beyond (some) natural physiological constraints. @Ahn:2012 provides a review of the work loop technique's importance to the field of muscle physiology.

The ability to import and analyze data from work loop (or other muscle physiology ) experiments has been conspicuously absent from open-source environments. ``workloopR`` (pronounced "work looper") provides functions for the import, transformation, and analysis of muscle physiology experiments in R. As the package's title suggests, our initial motivation was to provide functions to analyze work loops to determine net work and power output from the time-course of length and force change. Over the course of developing the package, we expanded this goal to cover additional types of experiments that are often complementary to the work loop technique. Accordingly, there are three currently supported experiment types: work loop, simple twitch, and tetanus.

Importing data via functions within the package creates objects of class ``muscle_stim``, which we designed to essentially behave as ``data.frame``s but with unique properties that work nicely with ``workloopR``'s core functions. Several of our functions are designed to parse information stored in .ddf format (e.g., generated by Aurora Scientific's Dynamic Muscle Control and Analysis Software). Time-course data on muscle length change, force development, and stimulation pattern are then imported as a ``muscle_stim`` object and important metadata and protocol information (e.g., specifics of the stimulus train) are stored in the object's attributes. File formats other than .ddf are welcome, but need to be coerced into ``muscle_stim`` objects by the user using the ``as_muscle_stim()`` function.

Prior to analysis, data can be transformed or corrected. Should metadata have been recorded incorrectly, the gear ratio of the motor arm and/or the direction of the muscle's length change can be adjusted. Before analyzing work loop data, cycles within the work loop can be labeled (according to various definitions of what constitutes a "cycle"), which allows calculation of metrics on a per-cycle basis.

Core data analytical functions include ``analyze_workloop()`` for work loop files and ``isometric_timing()`` for twitch and tetanus trials. ``analyze_workloop()`` computes instantaneous velocity, net work, instantaneous power, and net power for work loop trials on a per-cycle basis. ``isometric_timing()`` provides summarization of kinetics, i.e. the timing and magnitude of force production at various points within the tetanus or twitch trial.

We also include functions for batch processing files (e.g., multiple files from a common experiment). These functions allow for the import, cycle selection, gear ratio correction, and ultimately work & power computation for all work loop trial files within a specified directory.  Our batch analytical pipeline also allows users to correct for potential degradation of the muscle (according to power & work output) over the course of the experiment.

Although we do not provide plotting functions, all ``muscle_stim`` or ``data.frame`` objects produced by our analytical functions are designed to be friendly to visualization via either base-R plotting or `tidyverse` functions.

Please see Figure \ref{flowchart} below for an overview of the ``workloopR`` package with recommended functions and vignettes.

## Overview

`workloopR` (pronounced "work looper") provides functions for the import, transformation, and analysis of muscle physiology experiments in R. As the package's title suggests, our initial motivation was to provide functions to analyze work loops. The work loop technique ([Josephson 1985](https://jeb.biologists.org/content/114/1/493)) is used in studies of muscle physiology to determine the mechanical work and power output of a muscle. Over the course of developing the package, we expanded this goal to also cover experiments that are often complementary to the work loop technique. There are three currently supported experiment types: work loop, simple twitch, and tetanus.

![Figure 1](https://github.com/ropensci/workloopR/raw/master/images/fig1_workloop.png)

For more on work loops, we recommend a great review paper by Ahn ([2012](https://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.062752)) as well as [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_loop) Wikipedia page.



## Example

`workloopR` offers the ability to import, transform, and then analyze a data file. Here is an example using a work loop file included within the package:

```r
library(workloopR)

## import the workloop.ddf file included in workloopR
wl_dat <- read_ddf(system.file("extdata", "workloop.ddf",
                               package = 'workloopR'),
                  phase_from_peak = TRUE)

## select cycles 3 through 5 using a peak-to-peak definition
wl_selected <- select_cycles(wl_dat, cycle_def = "p2p", keep_cycles = 3:5)

## apply a gear ratio correction, run the analysis function,
## and then get the full object
wl_analyzed <- analyze_workloop(wl_selected, GR = 2)
## for brevity, the print() method for this object produces a simple output
wl_analyzed
```
	File ID: workloop.ddf
	Cycles: 3 cycles kept out of 6
	Mean Work: 0.00308 J
	Mean Power: 0.08474 W
```r
## but see the structure for the full output, e.g.
#str(wl_analyzed)

## or run the analysis but get the simplified version
wl_analyzed_simple <- analyze_workloop(wl_selected, simplify = TRUE, GR = 2)
wl_analyzed_simple
```
	  Cycle        Work  Net_Power
	a     A 0.002785397 0.07639783
	b     B 0.003147250 0.08661014
	c     C 0.003305744 0.09122522



## Core features and recommended vignettes

*For an overview, please also see our ["Introduction to workloopR"](https://docs.ropensci.org//workloopR/articles/Introduction-to-workloopR.html) vignette*

**Data import**: Importing data creates objects of class `muscle_stim`, which we designed to essentially behave as `data.frame`s but with unique properties that work nicely with ``workloopR``'s core functions. Data that are stored in .ddf format (e.g., generated by Aurora Scientific's Dynamic Muscle Control and Analysis Software) are easily imported. Other file formats are welcome, but need to be constructed into `muscle_stim` objects by the user; please see the vignette ["Importing data from non .ddf sources"](https://docs.ropensci.org/workloopR/articles/non-ddf-sources.html).

- Example:

```R
## import the workloop.ddf file included in workloopR
wl_dat <- read_ddf(system.file("extdata", "workloop.ddf",
                               package = 'workloopR'),
                  phase_from_peak = TRUE)

## see how the muscle_stim object is organized
wl_dat
str(wl_dat)
names(attributes(wl_dat))
```


**Data transformations & corrections**: Prior to analyses, data can be transformed or corrected. Should data have been recorded incorrectly, the gear ratio of the motor arm and/or the direction of the muscle's length change can be adjusted. Before analyzing work loop data, cycles within the work loop can be labeled (according to various definitions of what constitutes a "cycle"), which allows calculation of metrics on a per-cycle basis.

- Example:

```R
## correct the gear ratio of the motor arm
## we'll use gear ratio = 2
## this multiples Force by 2 and divides Position by 2
wl_fixed <- fix_GR(wl_dat, GR = 2)
```


**Analyses**: Core data analytical functions include ``analyze_workloop()`` for work loop files and ``isometric_timing()`` for twitch and tetanus trials.

- ``analyze_workloop()`` computes instantaneous velocity, net work, instantaneous power, and net power for work loop trials on a per-cycle basis. See the ["Analyzing work loop experiments in workloopR"](https://docs.ropensci.org/workloopR/articles/Analyzing-workloops.html) vignette.

- ``isometric_timing()`` provides summarization of kinetics, i.e. the timing and magnitude of force production at various points within the tetanus or twitch trial. See the ["Working with isometric experiments in workloopR"](https://docs.ropensci.org/workloopR/articles/Calculating-twitch-kinetics.html) vignette.

- Example:

```R
## import the twitch.ddf file included in workloopR
twitch_dat <- read_ddf(system.file("extdata", "twitch.ddf",
                                   package = 'workloopR'))

## run isometric_timing() to get info on twitch kinetics
## we'll use different set points than the defaults
analyze_twitch <- isometric_timing(twitch_dat,
                                   rising = c(25, 50, 75),
                                   relaxing = c(75, 50, 25))
```


**Batch processing**: We also include functions for batch processing files (e.g., multiple files from a common experiment). These functions allow for the import, cycle selection, gear ratio correction, and ultimately work & power computation for all work loop trial files within a specified directory.  This also allows users to correct for potential degradation of the muscle (according to power & work output) over the course of the experiment. See the ["Batch processing"](https://docs.ropensci.org/articles/batch-processing.html) vignette

- Example:

```R
## batch read and analyze files included with workloopR
analyzed_wls <- read_analyze_wl_dir(system.file("extdata/wl_duration_trials",
                                                package = 'workloopR'),
                                    phase_from_peak = TRUE,
                                    cycle_def = "p2p", keep_cycles = 2:4,
                                    GR = 2)
```


**Plotting**: Although we do not provide plotting functions, all resultant objects are designed to be friendly to visualization via either base-R plotting or `tidyverse` functions. Please see the ["Plotting data in workloopR"](https://docs.ropensci.org/articles/Plotting-workloopR.html) vignette.

The function `analyze_workloop()` in `workloopR` allows users to evaluate the mechanical work and power output of a muscle they have investigated through work loop experiments.

To demonstrate `analyze_workloop()`, we will first load `workloopR` and use example data provided with the package. We'll also load a couple packages within the `tidyverse` to help with data wrangling and plotting.


## Load packages and data

```{r package_loading, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(workloopR)
library(magrittr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```


## Visualize

We'll now import the `workloop.ddf` file included with `workloopR`. Because this experiment involved using a gear ratio of 2, we'll use `fix_GR()` to also implement this correction.

Ultimately, an object of classes `workloop`, `muscle_stim`, and `data.frame` is produced. `muscle_stim` objects are used throughout `workloopR` to help with data formatting and error checking across functions. Additionally setting the class to `workloop` allows our functions to understand that the data have properties that other experiment types (twitch, tetanus) do not. 

```{r data_import}
## The file workloop.ddf is included and therefore can be accessed via
## system.file("subdirectory","file_name","package") . We'll then use
## read_ddf() to import it, creating an object of class "muscle_stim".
## fix_GR() multiplies Force by 2 and divides Position by 2
workloop_dat <-
  system.file(
    "extdata",
    "workloop.ddf",
    package = 'workloopR') %>%
  read_ddf(phase_from_peak = TRUE) %>%
  fix_GR(GR = 2)

summary(workloop_dat)

```

Running `summary()` on a `muscle_stim shows a handy summary of file properties, data, and experimental parameters.

Let's plot Time against Force, Position, and Stimulus (Stim) to visualize the time course of the work loop experiment.

To get them all plotted in the same figure, we'll transform the data as they are being plotted. Please note that this is for aesthetic purposes only - the underlying data will not be changed after the plotting is complete.

```{r intial_plot}
scale_position_to_force <- 3000

workloop_dat %>%
  # Set the x axis for the whole plot
  ggplot(aes(x = Time)) +
  # Add a line for force
  geom_line(aes(y = Force, color = "Force"), 
            lwd = 1) +
  # Add a line for Position, scaled to approximately the same range as Force
  geom_line(aes(y = Position * scale_position_to_force, color = "Position")) +
  # For stim, we only want to plot where stimulation happens, so we filter the data
  geom_point(aes(y = 0, color = "Stim"), size = 1, 
             data = filter(workloop_dat, Stim == 1)) +
  # Next we add the second y-axis with the corrected units
  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . / scale_position_to_force, name = "Position (mm)")) +
  # Finally set colours, labels, and themes
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#FC4E2A", "#4292C6", "#373737")) +
  labs(y = "Force (mN)", x = "Time (secs)", color = "Parameter:") +
  ggtitle("Time course of \n work loop experiment") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.direction = "horizontal")
```

There's a lot to digest here. The blue trace shows the change in length of the muscle via cyclical, sinusoidal changes to Position. The dark gray Stim dots show stimulation on a off vs. on basis. Stimulus onset is close to when the muscle is at L0 and the stimulator zapped the muscle four times in pulses of 0.2 ms width at 300 Hz. The resulting force development is shown in red. These cycles of length change and stimulation occurred a total of 6 times (measuring L0-to-L0).

## Select cycles

We are now ready to run the `select_cycles()` function. This function subsets the data and labels each cycle in prep for our `analyze_workloop()` function.

In many cases, researchers are interested in using the final 3 cycles for analyses. Accordingly, we'll set the `keep_cycles` parameter to `4:6`. 

One thing to pay heed to is the cycle definition, encoded as `cycle_def` within the arguments of `select_cycles()`. There are three options for how cycles can be defined and are named based on the starting (and ending) points of the cycle. We'll use the L0-to-L0 option, which is encoded as `lo`. 

The function internally performs butterworth filtering of the Position data via `signal::butter()`. This is because Position data are often noisy, which makes assessing true peak values difficult. The default values of `bworth_order = 2` and `bworth_freq = 0.05` work well in most cases, but we recommend you please plot your data and assess this yourself.

We will keep things straightforward for now so that we can proceed to the analytical stage. Please see the final section of this vignette for more details on using `select_cycles()`.

```{r select_cycles}
## Select cycles
workloop_selected <- 
  workloop_dat %>%
  select_cycles(cycle_def="lo", keep_cycles = 4:6)

summary(workloop_selected)

attr(workloop_selected, "retained_cycles")
```

The `summary()` function now reflects that 3 cycles of the original 6 have been retained, and getting the `"retained_cycles"` attribute shows that these cycles are  4, 5, and 6 from the original data. 

To avoid confusion in numbering schemes between the original data and the new object, once `select_cycles()` has been used we label cycles by letter. So, cycle 4 is now "a", 5 is "b" and 6 is "c".


## Plot the work loop cycles

```{r work_loop_fig}
workloop_selected %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Position, y = Force)) +
  geom_point(size=0.3) +
  labs(y = "Force (mN)", x = "Position (mm)") +
  ggtitle("Work loop") +
  theme_bw()

```


## Basics of `analyze_workloop()`

Now we're ready to use `analyze_workloop()`. 

Again, running `select_cycles()` beforehand was necessary, so we will switch to using `workloop_selected` as our data object.

Within `analyze_workloop()`, the `GR =` option allows for the gear ratio to be corrected if it hasn't been already. But because we already ran `fix_GR()` to correct the gear ratio to 2, we will not need to use it here again. So, this for this argument, we will use `GR = 1`, which keeps the data as they are. Please take care to ensure that you do not overcorrect for gear ratio by setting it multiple times. Doing so induces multiplicative changes. E.g. setting `GR = 3` on an object and then setting `GR = 3` again produces a gear ratio correction of 9.


### Using the default `simplify = FALSE` version

The argument `simplify = ` affects the output of the `analyze_workloop()` function. We'll first take a look at the organization of the "full" version, i.e. keeping the default `simplify = FALSE`.

```{r analyze_workloop}
## Run the analyze_workloop() function
workloop_analyzed <-
  workloop_selected %>%
  analyze_workloop(GR = 1)

## Produces a list of objects. 
## The print method gives a simple output:
workloop_analyzed

## How is the list organized?
names(workloop_analyzed)
```

This produces an `analyzed_workloop` object that is essentially a `list` that is organized by cycle. Within each of these, time-course data are stored as a `data.frame` and important metadata are stored as attributes.

Users may typically want work and net power from each cycle. Within the `analyzed_workloop` object, these two values are stored as attributes: `"work"` (in J) and `"net_power"` (in W). To get them for a specific cycle:

```{r metrics_for_cycle}
## What is work for the second cycle?
attr(workloop_analyzed$cycle_b, "work")

## What is net power for the third cycle?
attr(workloop_analyzed$cycle_c, "net_power")
```

To see how e.g. the first cycle is organized:

```{r cycle_a_organization}
str(workloop_analyzed$cycle_a)
```

Within each cycle's `data.frame`, the usual `Time`, `Position`, `Force`, and `Stim` are stored. `Cycle`, added via `select_cycles()`, denotes cycle identity and `Percent_of_Cycle` displays time as a percentage of that particular cycle. 

`analyze_workloop()` also computes instantaneous velocity (`Inst_Velocity`) which can sometimes be noisy, leading us to also apply a butterworth filter to this velocity (`Filt_Velocity`). See the function's help file for more details on how to tweak filtering. The time course of power (instantaneous power) is also provided as `Inst_Power`.

Each of these variables can be plot against Time to see the time-course of that variable's change over the cycle. For example, we will plot instantaneous force in cycle b:

```{r instant_power_plot}
workloop_analyzed$cycle_b %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Percent_of_Cycle, y = Inst_Power)) +
  geom_line(lwd = 1) +
  labs(y = "Instantaneous Power (W)", x = "Percent cycle") +
  ggtitle("Instantaneous power \n during cycle b") +
  theme_bw()
```


### Setting `simpilfy = TRUE` in the `analyze_workloop()` function

If you simply want work and net power for each cycle without retaining any of the time-course data, set `simplify = TRUE` within `analyze_workloop()`.

```{r simplify_TRUE}
workloop_analyzed_simple <-
  workloop_selected %>%
  analyze_workloop(GR = 1, simplify = TRUE)

## Produces a simple data.frame:
workloop_analyzed_simple
str(workloop_analyzed_simple)
```

Here, work (in J) and net power (in W) are simply returned in a `data.frame` that is organized by cycle. No other attributes are stored.


## More on cycle definitions in `select_cycles()`

As noted above, there are three options for cycle definitions within `select_cycles()`, encoded as `cycle_def`. The three options for how cycles can be defined are named based on the starting (and ending) points of the cycle: L0-to-L0 (`lo`), peak-to-peak (`p2p`), and trough-to-trough (`t2t`).

We highly recommend that you plot your Position data after using `select_cycles()`. The `pracma::findpeaks()` function work for most data (especially sine waves), but it is conceivable that small, local 'peaks' may be misinterpreted as a cycle's true minimum or maximum.

We also note that edge cases (i.e. the first cycle or the final cycle) may also be subject to issues in which the cycles are not super well defined via an automated algorithm.

Below, we will plot a couple case examples to show what we generally expect. We recommend plotting your data in a similar fashion to verify that `select_cycles()` is behaving in the way you expect.


```{r select_cycles_defintions}
## Select cycles 4:6 using lo
workloop_dat %>%
  select_cycles(cycle_def="lo", keep_cycles = 4:6) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = Position)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw()

## Select cycles 4:6 using p2p
workloop_dat %>%
  select_cycles(cycle_def="p2p", keep_cycles = 4:6) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = Position)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw()
## here we see that via 'p2p' the final cycle is ill-defined because the return
## to L0 is considered a cycle. Using a p2p definition, what we actually want is
## to use cycles 3:5 to get the final 3 full cycles:
workloop_dat %>%
  select_cycles(cycle_def="p2p", keep_cycles = 3:5) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = Position)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw()

## this difficulty in defining cycles may be more apparent by first plotting the 
## cycles 1:6, e.g.
workloop_dat %>%
  select_cycles(cycle_def="p2p", keep_cycles = 1:6) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = Position)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw()

```

```

`workloopR`'s data import functions, such as `read_ddf()`, are generally geared towards importing data from .ddf files (e.g. those generated by Aurora Scientific's Dynamic Muscle Control and Analysis Software). 

Should your data be stored in another file format, you can use the `as_muscle_stim()` function to generate your own `muscle_stim` objects. These `muscle_stim` objects are used by nearly all other `workloopR` functions and are formatted in a very specific way. This helps ensure that other functions can interpret data & metadata correctly and also perform internal checks.


## Load packages

Before running through anything, we'll ensure we have the packages we need.

```{r package_loading, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(workloopR)
library(magrittr)
library(ggplot2)
```


## Data

Because it is somewhat difficult to simulate muscle physiology data, we'll use one of our workloop files, deconstruct it, and then re-assemble the data via `as_muscle_stim()`.

```{r get_data}
## Load in the work loop example data from workloopR
workloop_dat <-
  system.file(
    "extdata",
    "workloop.ddf",
    package = 'workloopR') %>%
  read_ddf(phase_from_peak = TRUE) %>%
  fix_GR(GR = 2)

## First we'll extract Time
Time <- workloop_dat$Time
## Now Position
Position <- workloop_dat$Position
## Force
Force <- workloop_dat$Force
## Stimulation
Stim <- workloop_dat$Stim

## Put it all together as a data.frame
my_data <- data.frame(Time = Time,
                      Position = Position,
                      Force = Force,
                      Stim = Stim)

head(my_data)
```


## Assemble via `as_muscle_stim()`
It is absolutely crucial that the columns be named "Time", "Position", "Force", and "Stim" (all case-sensitive). Otherwise, `as_muscle_stim()` will not interpret data correctly.

At minimum, this `data.frame`, the type of experiment, and the frequency at which data were recorded (`sample_frequency`, as a numeric) are necessary for `as_muscle_stim()`.

```{r as_mus_basic}
## Put it together
my_muscle_stim <- as_muscle_stim(x = my_data,
                                 type = "workloop",
                                 sample_frequency = 10000)

## Data are stored in columns and basically behave as data.frames
head(my_muscle_stim)

ggplot(my_muscle_stim, aes(x = Time, y = Position)) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(y = "Position (mm)", x = "Time (secs)") +
  ggtitle("Time course of length change") +
  theme_bw()
```


### Attributes

By default, a couple attributes are auto-filled based on the available information, but it's pretty bare-bones
```{r attributes}
str(attributes(my_muscle_stim))
```

We highly encourage you to add in as many of these details as possible by passing them in via the `...` argument. For example: 

```{r add_file_id}
## This time, add the file's name via "file_id"
my_muscle_stim <- as_muscle_stim(x = my_data,
                                 type = "workloop",
                                 sample_frequency = 10000,
                                 file_id = "workloop123")

## For simplicity, we'll just target the file_id attribute directly instead of 
## printing all attributes again
attr(my_muscle_stim, "file_id")


```


### Possible attributes

Here is a list of all possible attributes that can be filled. 
```{r}
names(attributes(workloop_dat))
```

To see how each should be formatted, (e.g. which ones take numeric values vs. character vectors...etc)

```{r}
str(attributes(workloop_dat))
```


## Thanks for reading!

Please feel free to contact either Vikram or Shree with suggestions or code development requests. We are especially interested in expanding our data import functions to accommodate file types other than .ddf in future versions of `workloopR`.

The `workloopR` package also provides a function that can calculate the timing and magnitude of force during isometric experiments (twitch, tetanus) via the `isometric_timing()` function.

To demonstrate, we will first load `workloopR` and use example data provided with the package. We'll also load a couple packages within the `tidyverse` as well as `viridis` to help with data wrangling and plotting.


## Load packages and data

```{r package_loading, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(workloopR)
library(magrittr)
library(ggplot2)
```


## Visualize

We'll now import the `twitch.ddf` file included with `workloopR`.

```{r data_import}
## The file twitch.ddf is included and therefore can be accessed via
## system.file("subdirectory","file_name","package") . We'll then use
## read_ddf() to import it, creating an object of class "muscle_stim".
twitch_dat <-
  system.file(
    "extdata",
    "twitch.ddf",
    package = 'workloopR') %>%
  read_ddf()

```

Let's plot Force vs. Time to visualize the time course of force development and relaxation.

```{r intial_plot}
twitch_dat %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = Force)) +
    geom_line() +
    ylab("Force (mN)") +
    xlab("Time (sec)") +
    theme_minimal()

```

This plot reveals that the final row of the data has Force = 0 and is likely an artifact. We can also see that the most salient parts of the twitch occur between ~ 0.075 and ~ 0.2 seconds. 

We'll just re-plot the salient parts of the twitch by setting new limits on the axes via `ggplot2::xlim()` and `ggplot2::ylim()`. Please note that this will not change any analyses - we are simply doing it for ease of visualizing patterns.

```{r data_cleaning}
## Re-plot
twitch_dat %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = Force)) +
    geom_line(lwd = 1) +
    xlim(0.075, 0.2) +
    ylim(200, 450) +
    xlab("Time (sec)") +
    ylab("Force (mN)") +
    theme_minimal()

```

Looks better!


## Basics of `isometric_timing()`

Now we're ready to use `isometric_timing()`.

```{r twitch_analysis}
## Run the isometric_timing() function
twitch_analyzed <-
  twitch_dat %>%
  isometric_timing()

twitch_analyzed
```

The function returns a new `data.frame` that provides information about the timing and magnitude of force at various intervals within the twitch. All returned values are absolute; in other words, time is measured from the beginning of the file and forces are returned in their actual magnitudes. 

The first five columns of this `data.frame` are fixed. They will return (in this order): 1) the ID of the file, 2) the time at which stimulation occurs, 3) magnitude of force when stimulation occurs, 4) time at which peak force occurs, and 5) magnitude of peak force. 

The function also provides data that help describe the rising and the relaxation phases of the twitch at certain "set points". By default, in the rising phase the set points are at 10% and at 90% of peak force development. Timing and force magnitudes at these points are returned as columns in the `data.frame`. And for the relaxation phase, the time and magnitude of force when force has relaxed to 90% and 50% of peak force are given.

The user has some flexibility in specifying how data are grabbed from the rising and falling phases. There are two arguments: `rising = c()` and `falling = c()`. Each of these arguments can be filled with a vector of any length. Within the vector, each of these "set points" must be a vector between 0 and 100, signifying the % of peak force development that is to be described.

For example, if we'd like to describe the rising phase at six points (e.g. 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 95% of peak force development):

```{r twitch_rising_custom}
## Change rising supply a custom set of force development set points
twitch_rising_custom <-
  twitch_dat %>%
  isometric_timing(rising = c(5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 95))

## The returned `data.frame` contains the timing and force magnitudes
## of these set points in the "..._rising_..." columns
twitch_rising_custom
```


### Tetanus trials

The `isometric_timing()` function can also work on `tetanus` objects that have been imported via `read_ddf()`. Should a `tetanus` object be used, the set points for relaxing are automatically set to `relaxing = c()`, which excludes this argument from producing anything. Instead, the timing & magnitude of force at stimulation, peak force, and specified points of the rising phase are returned. The idea of 'relaxation' is simply ignored. 

To demonstrate, we'll use an example tetanus trial included in `workloopR`: 
```{r tetanus}
tetanus_analyzed <-
  system.file(
    "extdata",
    "tetanus.ddf",
    package = 'workloopR') %>%
  read_ddf() %>%
  isometric_timing(rising = c(25, 50, 75))

tetanus_analyzed
```


## Computing intervals

The returned `data.frame` provides all timing and force magnitudes in absolute terms, i.e. time since the start of the file and actual force magnitudes. Often, we'd like to report characteristics of the twitch as intervals. 

To calculate, e.g. the interval between stimulation and peak force (often reported as "time to peak force"):

```{r twitch_intervals}
## Time to peak force from stimulation
twitch_analyzed$time_peak - twitch_analyzed$time_stim
```


## Annotate the twitch plot

It is also good to plot some of these metrics and see if they pass the eye-test.

We'll use our analyzed twitch and the `viridis` package to supply colors to dots at key points.

```{r annotated_plot}
## Create a color pallete
## Generated using `viridis::viridis(6)`
## We use hard-coded values here just to avoid extra dependencies 
colz <- c("#440154FF","#414487FF","#2A788EFF",
          "#22A884FF","#7AD151FF","#FDE725FF")

twitch_dat %>%
 ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = Force)) +
   geom_line(lwd = 1) +
   xlim(0.075, 0.2) +
   ylim(200, 450) +
   xlab("Time (sec)") +
   ylab("Force (mN)") +
   geom_point(x = twitch_analyzed$time_stim, 
              y = twitch_analyzed$force_stim,
              color = colz[1], size = 3) +
   geom_point(x = twitch_analyzed$time_peak, 
              y = twitch_analyzed$force_peak,
              color = colz[4], size = 3) +
   geom_point(x = twitch_analyzed$time_rising_10, 
              y = twitch_analyzed$force_rising_10,
              color = colz[2], size = 3) +
   geom_point(x = twitch_analyzed$time_rising_90, 
              y = twitch_analyzed$force_rising_90,
              color = colz[3], size = 3) +
   geom_point(x = twitch_analyzed$time_relaxing_90, 
              y = twitch_analyzed$force_relaxing_90,
              color = colz[5], size = 3) +
   geom_point(x = twitch_analyzed$time_relaxing_50, 
              y = twitch_analyzed$force_relaxing_50,
              color = colz[6], size = 3) +
   theme_minimal()
```

The plot has dots added for each of the six time&force points that the function returns by default.

  comment = "#>"
)
```

Many of the functions in the `workloopR` package are built to facilitate batch processing of workloop and related data files. This vignette will start with an overview of how the functions were intended to be used for batch processing and then provide specific examples.


## Conceptual overview

We generally expect a single file to store data from a single experimental trial, whereas directories hold data from all the trials of a single experiment. Accordingly, the `muscle_stim` objects created and used by most of the `workloopR` functions are intended to hold data from a single trial of a workloop or related experiment. Lists are then used to package together trials from a single experiment. This also lends itself to using recursion to transform and analyze all data from a single experiment.

In broad strokes, there are three ways that batch processing has been worked into `workloopR` functions. First, some functions like the `*_dir()` family of import functions and `summarize_wl_trials()` specifically generate or require lists of `muscle_stim` objects. Second, the first argument of all other functions are the objects being manipulated, which can help clean up recursion using the `purrr::map()` family of functions. Finally, some functions return summarized data as single rows of a data.frame that can easily be bound together to generate a summary table.


## Load packages and data

This vignette will rely heavily on the `purrr::map()` family of functions for recursion, though it should be mentioned that the `base::apply()` family of functions would work as well.

```{r package_loading, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(workloopR)
library(magrittr)
library(purrr)
```


## Necessarily-multi-trial functions


### `*_dir()` functions

Both `read_ddf()` and `read_analyze_wl()` have alternatives suffixed by `_dir()` to read in multiple files from a directory. Both take a path to the directory and an optional regular expression to filter files by and return a list of `muscle_stim` objects or `analyzed_workloop` objects, respectively.

```{r}
workloop_trials_list<-
  system.file(
    "extdata/wl_duration_trials",
    package = 'workloopR') %>%
  read_ddf_dir(phase_from_peak = TRUE)

workloop_trials_list[1:2]
```

The `sort_by` argument can be used to rearrange this list by any attribute of the read-in objects. By default, the objects are sorted by their modification time. Other arguments of `read_ddf()` and `read_analyze_wl()` can also be passed to their `*_dir()` alternatives as named arguments.

```{r}
analyzed_wl_list<-
  system.file(
    "extdata/wl_duration_trials",
    package = 'workloopR') %>%
  read_analyze_wl_dir(sort_by = 'file_id',
                      phase_from_peak = TRUE,
                      cycle_def = 'lo',
                      keep_cycles = 3)

analyzed_wl_list[1:2]
```


### Summarizing workloop trials

In a series of workloop trials, it can useful to see how mean power and work change as you vary different experimental parameters. To facilitate this, `summarize_wl_trials()` specifically takes a list of `analyzed_workloop` objects and returns a `data.frame` of this information. We will explore ways of generating lists of analyzed workloops without using `read_analyze_wl_dir()` in the following section.

```{r}
analyzed_wl_list %>%
  summarize_wl_trials
```


## Manual recursion examples


### Batch import for non-ddf data

One of the more realistic use cases for manual recursion is for importing data from multiple related trials that are not stored in ddf format. As with importing individual non-ddf data sources, we start by reading the data into a data.frame, only now we want a list of data.frames. In this example, we will read in csv files and stitch them into a list using `purrr::map()`

```{r}
non_ddf_list<-
  # Generate a vector of file names
  system.file(
    "extdata/twitch_csv",
    package = 'workloopR') %>%
  list.files(full.names = T) %>%
  # Read into a list of data.frames
  map(read.csv) %>%
  # Coerce into a workloop object
  map(as_muscle_stim, type = "twitch")
```


### Data transformation and analysis

Applying a constant transformation to a list of `muscle_stim` objects is fairly straightforward using `purrr::map()`.

```{r}
non_ddf_list<-
  non_ddf_list %>%
  map(~{
    attr(.x,"stimulus_width")<-0.2
    attr(.x,"stimulus_offset")<-0.1
    return(.x)
  }) %>%
  map(fix_GR,2)
```

Applying a non-constant transformation like setting a unique file ID can be done using `purrr::map2()`.

```{r}
file_ids<-paste0("0",1:4,"-",2:5,"mA-twitch.csv")

non_ddf_list<-
  non_ddf_list %>%
  map2(file_ids, ~{
    attr(.x,"file_id")<-.y
    return(.x)
  })

non_ddf_list
```

Analysis can similarly be run recursively. `isometric_timing()` in particular returns a single row of a data.frame with timings and forces for key points in an isometric dataset. Here we can use `purrr::map_dfr()` to bind the rows together for neatness.

```{r}
non_ddf_list %>%
  map_dfr(isometric_timing)
```

## Welcome to workloopR

In this vignette, we'll provide an overview of core functions in `workloopR`. Other vignettes within the package give more details with respect to specific use-cases. Examples with code can also be found within each function's Help doc.

`workloopR` (pronounced "work looper") provides functions for the import, transformation, and analysis of muscle physiology experiments. As you may have guessed, the initial motivation was to provide functions to analyze work loop experiments in R, but we have expanded this goal to cover additional types of experiments that are often involved in work loop procedures. There are three currently supported experiment types: work loop, simple twitch, and tetanus.


## Analytical pipelines

To cut to the chase, `workloopR` offers the ability to import, transform, and then analyze a data file. For example, with a work loop file:
```{r a_p_single_file}
library(workloopR)

## import the workloop.ddf file included in workloopR
wl_dat <-read_ddf(system.file("extdata", "workloop.ddf", 
                              package = 'workloopR'),
                  phase_from_peak = TRUE)

## select cycles 3 through 5 using a peak-to-peak definition
wl_selected <- select_cycles(wl_dat, cycle_def = "p2p", keep_cycles = 3:5)

## run the analysis function and get the full object
wl_analyzed <- analyze_workloop(wl_selected, GR = 2)
## for brevity, the print() method for this object produces a simple output
wl_analyzed
## but see the structure for the full output, e.g.
#str(wl_analyzed)

## or run the analysis but get the simplified version
wl_analyzed_simple <- analyze_workloop(wl_selected, simplify = TRUE, GR = 2)
wl_analyzed_simple
```

Batch processing of files within a directory (e.g. successive trials of an experiment) is also readily achieved:
```{r a_p_batch_files}
## batch read and analyze files included with workloopR
analyzed_wls <- read_analyze_wl_dir(system.file("extdata/wl_duration_trials",
                                               package = 'workloopR'),
                                   cycle_def = "p2p",
                                   keep_cycles = 2:4,
                                   phase_from_peak = TRUE
                                   )

## now summarize
summarized_wls <- summarize_wl_trials(analyzed_wls)
summarized_wls
```

Sections below will give more specific overviews.


## Data import

Data that are stored in .ddf format (e.g. generated by Aurora Scientific's Dynamic Muscle Control and Analysis Software) are easily imported via the function `read_ddf()`. Two additional all-in-one functions (`read_analyze_wl()` and `read_analyze_wl_dir()`) also import data and subsequently transform and analyze them. More on those functions later!

Importing via these functions generates objects of class `muscle_stim`, which are formatted to work nicely with `workloopR`'s core functions and help with error checking procedures throughout the package. `muscle_stim` objects are organized to store time-series data for Time, Position, Force, and Stimulation in a `data.frame` and also store core metadata and experimental parameters as Attributes.

We'll provide a quick example using data that are included within the package.

```{r data_import}
library(workloopR)

## import the workloop.ddf file included in workloopR
wl_dat <-read_ddf(system.file("extdata", "workloop.ddf", 
                              package = 'workloopR'),
                  phase_from_peak = TRUE)

## muscle_stim objects have their own print() and summary() S3 methods
## for example:
summary(wl_dat) # some handy info about the imported file

## see the first few rows of data stored within
head(wl_dat)
```


### Attributes

Again, important object metadata and experimental parameters are stored as attributes. We make extensive use of attributes throughout the package and most functions will update at least one attribute after completion. So please see this feature of your `muscle_stim` objects for important info!

You can use `attributes` on an object itself (e.g. `attributes(wl_dat)`), but we'll avoid doing so because the printout can be pretty lengthy.

Instead, let's just look at a couple interesting ones.

```{r attributes}
## names(attributes(x) gives a list of all the attributes' names
names(attributes(wl_dat))

## take a look at the stimulation protocol
attr(wl_dat, "protocol_table")

## at what frequency were cyclic changes to Position performed?
attr(wl_dat, "cycle_frequency")

## at what frequency were data recorded?
attr(wl_dat, "sample_frequency")
```


## Data from files that are not of .ddf format

Data that are read from other file formats can be constructed into `muscle_stim` objects via `as_muscle_stim()`. Should you need to do this, please refer to our vignette "Importing data from non .ddf sources" for an overview.


## Transformations and corrections to data

Prior to analyses, data can be transformed or corrected. Transformational functions include gear ratio correction (`fix_GR()`) and position inversion (`invert_position()`). The core idea behind these two functions is to correct issues related to data acquisition.

For example, to apply a gear ratio correction of 2:
```{r transformations}
## this multiples Force by 2
## and multiplies Position by (1/2)
wl_fixed  <- fix_GR(wl_dat, GR = 2)

# quick check:
max(wl_fixed$Force)/max(wl_dat$Force)       #5592.578 / 2796.289 = 2
max(wl_fixed$Position)/max(wl_dat$Position) #1.832262 / 3.664524 = 0.5
```


### A particularly important transformation - `select_cycles()`

Another 'transformational' function is `select_cycles()`, which subsets cycles within a work loop experiment. This is a necessary step prior to analyses of work loop data: data are labeled by cycle for use with `analyze_workloop()`.


## Data analytical functions

Core analytical functions include `analyze_workloop()` for work loop files and `isometric_timing()` for twitches. `analyze_workloop()` computes instantaneous velocity, net work, instantaneous power, and net power for work loop experiments on a per-cycle basis. `isometric_timing()` provides summarization of twitch kinetics.

To see more details about these functions, please refer to "Analyzing work loop experiments in workloopR" for work loop analyses and "Working with twitch files in workloopR" for twitches.

Some functions are readily available for batch processing of files. The `read_analyze_wl_dir()` function allows for the batch import, cycle selection, gear ratio correction, and ultimately work & power computation for all work loop experiment files within a specified directory. The `get_wl_metadata()` and `summarize_wl_trials()` functions organize scanned files by recency (according to their time of last modification: 'mtime') and then report work and power output in the order that trials were run.

This ultimately allows for the `time_correct()` function to correct for degradation of the muscle (according to power & work) over time, assuming that the first and final trials are identical in experimental parameters. If these parameters are not identical, we advise against using this function.


## Thanks for reading!

Please feel free to contact either Vikram or Shree with suggestions or code development requests. We are especially interested in expanding our data import functions to accommodate file types other than .ddf in future versions of `workloopR`.

Let's take a look at plotting data stored in objects created by `workloopR`!


## Loading packages and data

```{r package_loading, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(workloopR)
library(magrittr)
library(ggplot2)
library(purrr)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
```


## Plotting `workloop` objects


### Working with single files

Let's start by visualizing the raw traces in our data files, specifically position, force, and stimulation over time.

```{r data_import}
workloop_dat<-
  system.file(
    "extdata",
    "workloop.ddf",
    package = 'workloopR') %>%
  read_ddf(phase_from_peak = TRUE) %>%
  fix_GR(2)
```

```{r raw_trace}
# To overlay position and force, we need them to be on comparable scales
# We will then use two y-axis to make the units clear
scale_position_to_force <- 3000

workloop_dat %>%
  # Set the x axis for the whole plot
  ggplot(aes(x = Time)) +
  # Add a line for force
  geom_line(aes(y = Force, color = "Force"),
            lwd = 1) +
  # Add a line for Position, scaled to approximately the same range as Force
  geom_line(aes(y = Position * scale_position_to_force, color = "Position")) +
  # For stim, we only want to plot where stimulation happens, so we filter the data
  geom_point(aes(y = 0, color = "Stim"), size = 1,
             data = filter(workloop_dat, Stim == 1)) +
  # Next we add the second y-axis with the corrected units
  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . / scale_position_to_force, name = "Position (mm)")) +
  # Finally set colours, labels, and themes
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#FC4E2A", "#4292C6", "#373737")) +
  labs(y = "Force (mN)", x = "Time (secs)", color = "Parameter:") +
  ggtitle("Time course of \n work loop experiment") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.direction = "horizontal")
```

Next, we would select cycles from the workloop in preparation for analysis. Before we do this, let's keep all the cycles and visualize how `select_cycles()` splits the data. Note that you can include 0 in the `keep_cycles` argument to include data that is categorized as being outside of a complete cycle. This assigns a single cycle label (a) to the data before and after the complete cycles.

```{r annotate_cycles, warning=FALSE}
# Let's calculate x and y positions to add labels for each cycle
workloop_dat<-
  workloop_dat %>%
  select_cycles('lo', 0:6)

label_dat<-
  workloop_dat %>%
  group_by(Cycle) %>%
  summarize(
    x = mean(Time)
  ) %>%
  # And add another row for the incomplete cycles at the beginning
  bind_rows(data.frame(
    Cycle = 'a',
    x = 0))

workloop_dat %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = Position, colour = Cycle)) +
  geom_point(size=1) +
  geom_text(aes(x, y=2.1, colour = Cycle, label = Cycle), data = label_dat) +
  labs(y = "Position (mm)", x = "Time (secs)") +
  ggtitle("Division of position\nby `select_cycles()`") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Visualizing the cycles is a highly recommended in case noise before or after the experimental procedure is interpreted as a cycle.

Let's go ahead and use cycles 2 to 5 (labeled c-f in the previous plot). Note however that the cycle labels will be reassigned from a-d when we subset the data.

```{r select_cycles}
workloop_dat<-
  workloop_dat %>%
  select_cycles('p2p', 2:5)
```

Now let's plot some work loops!

```{r analyze_workloop}
# Let's start with a single cycle using colour to indicate time
workloop_dat %>%
  filter(Cycle == 'a') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Position, y = Force)) +
  geom_path(aes(colour = Time)) +
  labs(y = "Force (mN)", x = "Position (mm)", colour = "Time (sec)") +
  ggtitle("Single work loop") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.direction = "horizontal")

# Now let's see how the work loop changes across cycles
# We can use arrows to indicate direction through time
workloop_dat %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Position, y = Force)) +
  geom_path(aes(colour = Cycle), arrow=arrow()) +
  labs(y = "Force (mN)", x = "Position (mm)", colour = "Cycle index") +
  ggtitle("Work loops by cycle index") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.direction = "horizontal")
```


### Working with single files

Working with multiple files is a little trickier as multiple the data are stored in separate `data.frame`s organized into a list. The easiest way to deal with this issue is to add a column specifying the file id and concatenating the data together. Refer to the "Batch processing" vignette for more information on working with multiple files.

```{r multifile}
multi_workloop_dat<-
  system.file(
    "extdata/wl_duration_trials",
    package = 'workloopR') %>%
  read_ddf_dir(phase_from_peak = TRUE) %>%
  map(fix_GR, 2) %>%
  map(select_cycles,'p2p', 4) %>%
  map(analyze_workloop)

# Summarize provides a quick way to pull out most experimental parameters, etc
multi_workloop_dat %>%
  summarize_wl_trials %>%
  ggplot(aes(Stimulus_Pulses, Mean_Power)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "Mean Power (W)", x = "Stim Duration (pulses)") +
  ggtitle("Mean power over trial\nby stimulus duration") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.direction = "horizontal")

# Accessing the time course data requires more manipulation
multi_workloop_dat %>%
  map(~ mutate(.x$cycle_a, stim_pulses = attr(.x, "stimulus_pulses"))) %>%
  bind_rows %>%
  ggplot(aes(Percent_of_Cycle, Inst_Power)) +
  geom_path(aes(colour = as.factor(stim_pulses)))+
  labs(y = "Power (W)", x = "Percent of Cycle", colour = "Stim Duration") +
  ggtitle("Time course of instantaneous\npower by stimulus duration") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.direction = "horizontal")
```


## Plotting isometric objects


### Working with single files

One useful visualization with isometric data is annotating peak force and other timing points. With a single file and multiple set points, some manipulation is useful to make annotating a little cleaner.

```{r isometric_annotation}
twitch_dat<-
  system.file(
    "extdata",
    "twitch.ddf",
    package = 'workloopR') %>%
  read_ddf() %>%
  fix_GR(2)

# We now need to reshape the single row into three columns, a label for the point, an x value for the label (time), and a y value (force). See the `tidyr` package and associated vignettes on reshaping tips
label_dat<-
  twitch_dat %>%
  isometric_timing(c(10,90),50) %>%
  gather(label, value) %>%
  filter(label != 'file_id') %>%
  separate(label, c("type", "identifier"), "_", extra="merge") %>%
  spread(type,value)
label_dat$time<-as.numeric(label_dat$time)
label_dat$force<-as.numeric(label_dat$force)

ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(Time, Force), data = twitch_dat) +
  geom_point(aes(time, force), data = label_dat) +
  geom_text(aes(time, force, label = identifier), hjust=-0.15, data = label_dat) +
  labs(y = "Force (mN)", x = "Time (sec)") +
  ggtitle("Force development in a twitch trial") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.direction = "horizontal")
```


### Working with multiple files

We can also overlay data from multiple isometric trials to see how force evolves across trials. Please see the "Batch processing" vignette for more details on how to work with multiple files.

```{r iso_multi}
multi_twitch_dat<-
  system.file(
    "extdata/twitch_csv",
    package = 'workloopR') %>%
  list.files(full.names = T) %>%
  map(read.csv) %>%
  map2(c("2mA","3mA","4mA","5mA"), ~as_muscle_stim(.x, type = 'twitch', file_id = .y))

# Next we want another data.frame of label data
multi_label_dat<-
  multi_twitch_dat %>%
  map_dfr(isometric_timing) %>%
  select(file_id, ends_with("peak")) %>%
  mutate(label = paste0(round(force_peak),"mV"))

# Once again we want the data in a single data.frame with a column for which trial it came from
multi_twitch_dat %>%
  map_dfr(~mutate(.x, file_id = attr(.x, "file_id"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = Force, colour = file_id)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_text(aes(time_peak, force_peak, label = label), hjust=-0.7, data = multi_label_dat) +
  labs(y = "Force (mN)", x = "Time (sec)", colour = "Stimulation Current") +
  ggtitle("Force development across twitch trials") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.direction = "horizontal")

```

Please note that these twitch trials have differing values of initial force, so actual force developments are not identical to peak forces.

\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{muscle_stim} object that contains data from an isometric
twitch trial, ideally created via \code{read_ddf}.}

\item{rising}{Set points of the rising phase to be described.
By default: 10\% and 90\%.}

\item{relaxing}{Set points of the relaxation phase to be described.
By default: 90\% and 50\%.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with the following metrics as columns:
\item{file_ID }{File ID}
\item{time_stim}{Time between beginning of data collection and when
stimulation occurs}
\item{force_stim}{Magnitude of force at the onset of stimulation}
\item{time_peak}{Absolute time of peak force, i.e. time between beginning of
data collection and when peak force occurs}
\item{force_peak}{Magnitude of peak force}
\item{time_rising_X}{Time between beginning of data collection and X\% of
 force development}
\item{force_rising_X}{Magnitude of force at X\% of force development}

}
\description{
Calculate timing and magnitude of force at stimulation, peak force, and
various parts of the rising (force development) and relaxation (falling)
phases of the twitch.
}
\details{
The \code{data.frame} (x) must have time series data organized in
columns. Generally, it is preferred that you use a \code{muscle_stim} object
imported by \code{read_ddf()}.

The \code{rising} and \code{relaxing} arguments allow for the user to supply
numeric vectors of any length. By default, these arguments are
\code{rising = c(10, 90)} and \code{relaxing  = c(90, 50)}. Numbers in each
of these correspond to percent values and capture time and force at that
percent of the corresponding curve. These values can be replaced by those
that the user specifies and do not necessarily need to have length = 2. But
please note that 0 and 100 should not be used, e.g.
\code{rising = seq(10, 90, 5)} works, but \code{rising = seq(0, 100, 5)}
does not.

\title{workloopR: Analysis of Work Loops and Other Data from Muscle Physiology Experiments}
\description{
Functions for the import, transformation, and analysis of data 
    from muscle physiology experiments. The work loop technique is used to 
    evaluate the mechanical work and power output of muscle. Josephson (1985) 
    <doi:10.1242/jeb.114.1.493> modernized the technique for
    application in comparative biomechanics. Although our initial motivation 
    was to provide functions to analyze work loop experiment data, as we 
    developed the package we incorporated the ability to analyze data from 
    experiments that are often complementary to work loops. There are currently 
    three supported experiment types: work loops, simple twitches, and tetanus 
    trials. Data can be imported directly from .ddf files or via an object 
    constructor function. Through either method, data can then be cleaned or 
    transformed via methods typically used in studies of muscle physiology. 
    Data can then be analyzed to determine the timing and magnitude of force 
    development and relaxation (for isometric trials) or the magnitude of work, 
    net power, and instantaneous power among other things (for work loops). 
    Although we do not provide plotting functions, all resultant objects are 
    designed to be friendly to visualization via either base-R plotting or 
    'tidyverse' functions.
 This package has been peer-reviewed by rOpenSci (v. 1.1.0).

\description{
\code{read_analyze_wl()} is an all-in-one function to read in a work loop
file, select cycles, and compute work and power output.
}
\details{
Please be careful with units! See Warnings below. This function
combines \code{read_ddf()} with \code{select_cycles()} and then ultimately
\code{analyze_workloop()} into one handy function.

As detailed in these three functions, possible arguments include: \cr
\code{cycle_def} - used to specify which part of the cycle is understood as
the beginning and end. There are currently three options: 'lo' for L0-to-L0;
'p2p' for peak-to-peak; and 't2t' for trough-to-trough \cr
\code{bworth_order} - Filter order for low-pass filtering of \code{Position}
 via \code{signal::butter} prior to finding peak lengths. Default: 2. \cr
\code{bworth_freq} - Critical frequency (scalar) for low-pass filtering of
\code{Position} via \code{signal::butter} prior to finding peak lengths.
Default: 0.05. \cr
\code{keep_cycles} - Which cycles should be retained. Default: 4:6. \cr
\code{GR} - Gear ratio. Default: 1. \cr
\code{M} - Velocity multiplier used to positivize velocity; should be either
-1 or 1. Default: -1. \cr
\code{vel_bf} - Critical frequency (scalar) for low-pass filtering of
velocity via \code{signal::butter}. Default: 0.05. \cr

The gear ratio (GR) and velocity multiplier (M) parameters can help correct
for issues related to the magnitude and sign of data collection. By
default, they are set to apply no gear ratio adjustment and to positivize
velocity. Instantaneous velocity is often noisy and the \code{vel_bf}
parameter allows for low-pass filtering of velocity data. See
\code{signal::butter()} and \code{signal::filtfilt()} for details of how
filtering is achieved.

\section{Warning}{

Most systems we have encountered record Position data in millimeters
and Force in millinewtons, and therefore this function assumes data are
recorded in those units. Through a series of internal conversions, this
function computes velocity in meters/sec, work in Joules, and power in

please transform your data accordingly and ignore what you see in the

\description{
Uses \code{read_ddf()} to read in workloop, twitch, or tetanus experiment
data from multiple .ddf files.
}
\details{
Read in a .ddf file that contains data from an experiment. If
position and force do not correspond to columns 2 and 3 (respectively),
replace "2" and "3" within \code{rename_cols} accordingly. Similarly,
\code{skip_cols = 4:11} should be adjusted if more than 11 columns are
present and/or columns 4:11 contain important data.

Please note that there is no correction for gear ratio or further
manipulation of data. See \code{fix_GR} to adjust gear ratio. Gear ratio can
also be adjusted prior to analyses within the \code{analyze_workloop()}
function, the data import all-in-one function \code{read_analyze_wl()}, or
the batch analysis all-in-one \code{read_analyze_wl_dir()}.

Please also note that organization of data within the .ddf file is assumed to
conform to that used by Aurora Scientific's Dynamic Muscle Control and
Analysis Software. YMMV if using a .ddf file from another source. The
\code{as_muscle_stim()} function can be used to generate \code{muscle_stim}
objects if data are imported via another function. Please feel free to
contact us with any issues or requests.

\description{

}
\details{
If several files (e.g. successive trials from one experiment) are
stored in one folder, use this function to obtain metadata in a list
format. Runs \code{file.info()} from base R to extract info from files.

This function is not truly considered to be part of the batch analysis
pipeline;
see \code{read_analyze_wl_dir()} for a similar function that not
only grabs metadata but also imports & analyzes files. Instead,
\code{get_wl_metadata()} is meant to be a handy function to investigate
metadata issues that arise if running \code{read_analyze_wl_dir()} goes awry.

Unlike \code{read_analyze_wl_dir()}, this function does not necessarily need
files to all be work loops. Any file type is welcome (as long as the Regex
\code{pattern} argument makes sense).

\details{
\code{select_cycles()} subsets data from a workloop trial by
position cycle. The \code{cycle_def} argument is used to specify which part
of the cycle is understood as the beginning and end. There are currently
three options: \cr
'lo' for L0-to-L0; \cr
'p2p' for peak-to-peak; and \cr
't2t' for trough-to-trough \cr

Peaks are identified using \code{pracma::findpeaks()}. L0 points on the
rising edge are found by finding the midpoints between troughs and the
following peak. However the first and last extrema and L0 points may be
misidentified by this method. Please plot your \code{Position} cycles to
ensure the edge cases are identified correctly.

The \code{keep_cycles} argument is used to determine which cycles (as
defined by \code{cycle_def} should be retained in the final dataset. Zero
is the index assigned to all data points that are determined to be outside
a complete cycle.

The \code{muscle_stim} object (\code{x}) must be a \code{workloop},
preferably read in by one of our data import functions. Please see
documentation for \code{as_muscle_stim()} if you need to manually construct
a \code{muscle_stim} object from another source.

\description{
\code{read_ddf} reads in workloop, twitch, or tetanus experiment data from
.ddf files.
}
\details{
Read in a .ddf file that contains data from an experiment. If
position and force do not correspond to columns 2 and 3 (respectively),
replace "2" and "3" within \code{rename_cols} accordingly. Similarly,
\code{skip_cols = 4:11} should be adjusted if more than 11 columns are
present and/or columns 4:11 contain important data.

Please note that there is no correction for gear ratio or further
manipulation of data. See \code{fix_GR} to adjust gear ratio. Gear ratio can
also be adjusted prior to analyses within the \code{analyze_workloop()}
function, the data import all-in-one function \code{read_analyze_wl()}, or
the batch analysis all-in-one \code{read_analyze_wl_dir()}.

Please also note that organization of data within the .ddf file is assumed to
conform to that used by Aurora Scientific's Dynamic Muscle Control and
Analysis Software. YMMV if using a .ddf file from another source. The
\code{as_muscle_stim()} function can be used to generate \code{muscle_stim}
objects if data are imported via another function. Please feel free to
contact us with any issues or requests.

For use when data are not stored in .ddf format and you would like
to create a \code{muscle_stim} object that can be used by other workloopR
functions.
}
\details{
\code{muscle_stim} objects, which are required by (nearly) all
workloopR functions, are automatically created via \code{read_ddf()}. Should
you have data that are stored in a format other than .ddf, use this function
to create your own object of class \code{muscle_stim}.

The input \code{x} must be a \code{data.frame} that contains time series
of numeric data collected from an experiment. Each row must correspond to a
sample, and these columns (exact title matches) must be included: \cr
"Time" - time, recorded in seconds \cr
"Position" - instantaneous position of the muscle,
  preferably in millimeters \cr
"Force" - force, preferably in millinewtons \cr
"Stim" - whether stimulation has occurred. All entries must be either 0 (no
stimulus) or 1 (stimulus occurrence).

Additional arguments can be provided via \code{...}. For all experiment
types, the following attributes are appropriate: \cr
"units","header", "units_table",
"protocol_table", "stim_table",
"stimulus_pulses", "stimulus_offset",
"stimulus_width", "gear_ratio",
"file_id", or "mtime".

Please ensure that further attributes are appropriate to your experiment
type.

For workloops, these include:
"stimulus_frequency", "cycle_frequency",
"total_cycles", "cycle_def",
"amplitude", "phase",
and "position_inverted"

For twitches or tetanic trials:
"stimulus_frequency", and "stimulus_length"

}
\description{
Compute work and power output from a work loop experiment on a per-cycle
basis.
}
\details{
Please note that \code{select_cycles()} must be run on data prior to
using this function. This function relies on the input \code{muscle_stim}
object being organized by cycle number.

The \code{muscle_stim} object (\code{x}) must be a \code{workloop},
preferably read in by one of our data import functions. Please see
documentation for \code{as_muscle_stim()} if you need to manually construct
a \code{muscle_stim} object from a non .ddf source.

The gear ratio (GR) and velocity multiplier (M) parameters can help correct
for issues related to the magnitude and sign of data collection. By default,
they are set to apply no gear ratio adjustment and to positivize velocity.
Instantaneous velocity is often noisy and the \code{vel_bf} parameter allows
for low-pass filtering of velocity data. See \code{signal::butter()} and
\code{signal::filtfilt()} for details of how filtering is achieved.

Please also be careful with units! Se Warning section below.
}
\section{Warning}{

Most systems we have encountered record Position data in millimeters
and Force in millinewtons, and therefore this function assumes data are
recorded in those units. Through a series of internal conversions, this
function computes velocity in meters/sec, work in Joules, and power in
Watts. If your raw data do not originate in millimeters and millinewtons,
please transform your data accordingly and ignore what you see in the
attribute \code{units}.

function of time. Accordingly, the difference between the final and first
trial's (absolute) power output is used to 'correct' trials that occur in
between, with explicit consideration of run order and time elapsed (via
mtime). A similar correction procedure is applied to work.
