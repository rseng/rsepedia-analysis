`fauxpas` does http errors

* HTTP error classes more in line with Ruby/Python/Etc.
* An error class for each HTTP status in case a user wants to
be specific to an HTTP status code, and general purpose handlers
for any error
* Work with any of the major R http clients: `crul`, `curl`, `httr`, (maybe
`RCurl` later)
* Provide flexiblity for what to do on an HTTP error, including
custom functions and message templates

* HTTP on wikipedia: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol>
* HTTP2 on wikipedia: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2>
* HTTP/1.1: <https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html>
* HTTP/2: <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540>

## Install

CRAN version


```r
install.packages("fauxpas")
```

Dev version


```r
remotes::install_github("ropensci/fauxpas")
```


```r
library("fauxpas")
```

## use with crul


```r
library("crul")
cli <- HttpClient$new("https://httpbin.org/status/414")
res <- cli$get()
http(res)
#> Error: Request-URI Too Long (HTTP 414).
http414(res)
#> Error: Request-URI Too Long (HTTP 414).
```


```r
x <- HTTPRequestURITooLong$new()
x$do_verbose(res)
#> Error: Request-URI Too Long (HTTP 414).
#> - The server is refusing to service the request because the Request-URI is
#>    longer than the server is willing to interpret. This rare condition is only likely
#>    to occur when a client has improperly converted a POST request to a GET request
#>    with long query information, when the client has descended into a URI black hole
#>    of redirection (e.g., a redirected URI prefix that points to a suffix of itself),
#>    or when the server is under attack by a client attempting to exploit security
#>    holes present in some servers using fixed-length buffers for reading or
#>    manipulating the Request-URI.
```

## use with curl


```r
library("curl")
h <- curl::new_handle()
curl::handle_setopt(h)
resp <- curl::curl_fetch_memory("https://httpbin.org/status/404", h)
http(resp)
#> Error: Not Found (HTTP 404).
http404(resp)
#> Error: Not Found (HTTP 404).
```


```r
x <- HTTPNotFound$new()
x$do_verbose(resp)
#> Error:  Not Found (HTTP 404).
#>  - The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI. No indication is
#> given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent. The 410 (Gone) status
#> code SHOULD be used if the server knows, through some internally configurable
#> mechanism, that an old resource is permanently unavailable and has no forwarding
#> address. #> This status code is commonly used when the server does not wish to
#> reveal exactly why the request has been refused, or when no other response is
#> applicable.
```

## use with httr


```r
library("httr")
res <- GET("https://httpbin.org/status/405")
http405(res)
#> Error: Method Not Allowed (HTTP 405).
```


```r
x <- HTTPMethodNotAllowed$new()
x$do_verbose(res)
#> Error: Method Not Allowed (HTTP 405).
#>  - The method specified in the Request-Line is not allowed for the resource
#> identified by the Request-URI. The response MUST include an Allow header
#> containing a list of valid methods for the requested resource.
```

fauxpas 0.5.0
=============

### NEW FEATURES

* changed default for parameter `behavior` in function `http()` to `auto` instead of `stop` (#12)
* `http()` gains new parameter `muffle` (logical) to optionally muffle any warning/message from http status codes in series  (#12)


fauxpas 0.2.0
=============

### NEW FEATURES

* New function `find_error_class()` for a user to get a `HTTP*` class object with just the status code (#10)
* Added a vignette (#4)
* Added an additional object type that fauxpas responds to: the `Response` from the `webmockr` package and the `VcrResponse` from the `vcr` package (#9)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* `behavior_type` variable in the `Error` class object is now a private variable, and can be set with a new method `$set_behavior()` (#7)
* For `http*()` S3 list methods added additional checks for response objects from `curl` package that are simple lists, so are challenging to verify (#5)
* Added tests for all `http*` methods via a generator (#11)

### BUG FIXES

* Fixed `message_template` behavior, see above related comment about new message template param (#8)


fauxpas 0.1.0
=============

### NEW FEATURES

* Released to CRAN.
## Test environments

* local macOS install, R 3.6.3 patched
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

## Reverse dependencies

* I have run R CMD check on the 6 downstream dependencies
(<https://github.com/ropensci/fauxpas/blob/master/revdep/README.md>).
No problems were found.

This version includes a couple of new features.
