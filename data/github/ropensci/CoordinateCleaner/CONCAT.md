Automated flagging of common spatial and temporal errors in biological and palaeontological collection data, for the use in conservation, ecology and palaeontology. Specifically includes tests for

* General coordinate validity
* Country and province centroids
* Capital coordinates
* Coordinates of biodiversity institutions
* Spatial outliers
* Temporal outliers
* Coordinate-country discordance
* Duplicated coordinates per species
* Assignment to the location of the GBIF headquarters
* Urban areas
* Seas
* Plain zeros
* Equal longitude and latitude
* Rounded coordinates
* DDMM to DD.DD coordinate conversion errors
* Large temporal uncertainty (fossils)
* Equal minimum and maximum ages (fossils)
* Spatio-temporal outliers (fossils)

CoordinateCleaner can be particularly useful to improve data quality when using data from GBIF (e.g. obtained with [rgbif]( https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif)) or the Paleobiology database (e.g. obtained with [paleobioDB](https://github.com/ropensci/paleobioDB)) for historical biogeography (e.g. with [BioGeoBEARS](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BioGeoBEARS) or [phytools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=phytools)), automated conservation assessment (e.g. with [speciesgeocodeR](https://github.com/azizka/speciesgeocodeR/wiki) or [conR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ConR)) or species distribution modelling (e.g. with [dismo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dismo) or [sdm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sdm)). See [scrubr](https://github.com/ropensci/scrubr) and [taxize](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize) for complementary taxonomic cleaning or [biogeo](https://github.com/cran/biogeo) for correcting spatial coordinate errors.

See [News](https://github.com/ropensci/CoordinateCleaner/blob/master/NEWS.md) for update information.

# Installation
## Stable from CRAN

```r
install.packages("CoordinateCleaner")
library(CoordinateCleaner)
```

## Developmental from GitHub
```r
devtools::install_github("ropensci/CoordinateCleaner")
library(CoordinateCleaner)
```

# Usage
A simple example:

```r
# Simulate example data
minages <- runif(250, 0, 65)
exmpl <- data.frame(species = sample(letters, size = 250, replace = TRUE),
                    decimallongitude = runif(250, min = 42, max = 51),
                    decimallatitude = runif(250, min = -26, max = -11),
                    min_ma = minages,
                    max_ma = minages + runif(250, 0.1, 65),
                    dataset = "clean")

# Run record-level tests
rl <- clean_coordinates(x = exmpl)
summary(rl)
plot(rl)

# Dataset level 
dsl <- clean_dataset(exmpl)

# For fossils
fl <- clean_fossils(x = exmpl,
                          taxon = "species",
                          lon = "decimallongitude", 
                          lat = "decimallatitude")
summary(fl)

# Alternative example using the pipe
library(tidyverse)

cl <- exmpl %>%
  cc_val()%>%
  cc_cap()%>%
  cd_ddmm()%>%
  cf_range(lon = "decimallongitude", 
           lat = "decimallatitude", 
           taxon  ="species")
```

## Bugs, suggestions or feature requests?

* Submit an issue on the [Issues page](https://github.com/azizka/CoordinateCleaner/issues) - be sure to include R session information and a reproducible example.

## Code contribution

* If you want to contribute to the package - awesome. Please get in touch with [zizka.alexander@gmail.com](mailto:zizka.alexander@gmail.com).# Version 2.0-20

Fixing a warning resulting from unbalanced code chunk delimiters in one of the vignettes in the previous version (2.0-18) on CRAN. 

Additionally, change of maintainer email due to a change in institution.

The NOTE on spelling errors in the DESCRIPTION is spurious in my opinion, since it flags my last name and Latin abbreviation "et al"" from the literature reference.

The package has been removed from CRAN due to slow response time. Response time was slow because I am on parental leave.
