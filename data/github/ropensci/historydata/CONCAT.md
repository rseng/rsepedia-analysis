[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ropensci/historydata.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ropensci/historydata)

## Overview

These sample data sets are intended for historians learning R. They
include population, institutional, religious, military, and
prosopographical data suitable for mapping, quantitative analysis, and
network analysis.

## Installation

To install the package from CRAN:

    install.packages("historydata")

To install the development version, you will first have to install
[devtools][] and then install this package from GitHub.

To install:

    devtools::install_github("ropensci/historydata")

## Use

To list all the datasets in the package with their documentation:

    library(historydata)
    help(package = historydata)

To load a dataset:

    data(catholic_dioceses)

## Contributing

If you have a dataset that you think would be good for this package,
feel free to contribute it. You can send the dataset via e-mail if you
can provide a citation and guarantee that the data is available under an
open license.

But it is much preferred that you contribute the dataset via a pull
request. To add a dataset:

1.  Add the raw data and an R script to load and save it as an R data
    object to `data-raw/`. The `.rda` file should be saved to `data/`.
    See `data-raw/sarna.R` as a model. Please try keeping the data
    [tidy][].
2.  Add the documentation using the [Roxygen][] format to a file in the
    `R/`. Use `R/sarna.R` as a model. Be sure to include a citation.

  at the mission, which is a rough proxy for the number of people who
  attended the mission.

This dataset contains records of the careers of officers of the line in the

dates at which officers were promoted to the ranks of midshipment,
lieutenant, master commandament, and captain.

\section{Variables}{


  \itemize{

  \item \code{id}: A unique numeric identifier for each officer.

  \item \code{name}: Name of the officer.

  \item \code{generation}: A numeric value to represent a judgment about the
  generations within the officer corp of the U.S. Navy. First generation
  officers entered the service before 1801, as a rank higher than midshipman.
  Second generation officers entered the service before the Peace
  Establishment Act (or by the end of 1801), but as midshipman. Thus, they
  essentially became adults in the service, and they learned their craft from
  the first generation. Third generation officers entered the service as
  midshipmen after the Peace Establishment Act but before the end of the War
  of 1812. Those officers in this generation who became captain rose to that
  rank in the 1830s and '40s. Fourth generation officers entered the service
  after the War of 1812 had ended. These officers saw almost no wartime
  service, and many of the ones who achieved captain found themselves having
  to decide whether to serve in the Union or the Confederacy during the Civil
  War.

  \item \code{rank}: The ranks which officers obtained, including
  \code{midshipman}, \code{lieutenant}, \code{master_commandant}, and
  \code{captain}. Also included are the dates some officers
  \code{left_service}.

Weber includes two sections, one of raw data compiled from the
Minutes of the General Assembly, which apparently includes the foreign
membership of the Presbyterian churches. The second section contains the data
that Weber used for his visualizations, which excludes the foreign membership
and makes various calculations on the data.

Not all of the data in Weber is reproduced here. The data comes from part 1,
with the tables on financial information excluded.

One field that varies in title from members received by exam to members
received by confession varies in title, but has been presumed to refer to the
same process.
