`rnoaa` is an R interface to many NOAA data sources. We don't cover all of them, but we include many commonly used sources, and add we are always adding new sources. We focus on easy to use interfaces for getting NOAA data, and giving back data in easy to use formats downstream. We currently don't do much in the way of plots or analysis. To get started see: https://docs.ropensci.org/rnoaa/articles/rnoaa.html

## Data sources in rnoaa

* NOAA NCDC climate data:
    * We are using the NOAA API version 2
    * Docs for the NCDC API are at https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2
    * GHCN Daily data is available at http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ghcn-daily-description via FTP and HTTP
* Severe weather data docs are at https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/swdiws/
* Sea ice data (ftp://sidads.colorado.edu/DATASETS/NOAA/G02135/shapefiles)
* NOAA buoy data (https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/)
* ERDDAP data (https://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html)
  * Now in package rerddap (https://github.com/ropensci/rerddap)
* Tornadoes! Data from the NOAA Storm Prediction Center (https://www.spc.noaa.gov/gis/svrgis/)
* HOMR - Historical Observing Metadata Repository (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/homr/api)
* GHCND FTP data (ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa) - NOAA NCDC API has some/all (not sure really) of this data, but FTP allows to get more data more quickly
* Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) data (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/marineocean-data/extended-reconstructed-sea-surface-temperature-ersst-v4)
* Argo buoys (http://www.argo.ucsd.edu/) - a global array of more than 3,000 free-drifting profiling floats that measures thetemperature and salinity of the upper 2000 m of the ocean
* NOAA CO-OPS - tides and currents data (https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/)
* NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) (http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/)
* Africa Rainfall Climatology version 2 (ftp://ftp.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/fews/fewsdata/africa/arc2/ARC2_readme.txt)
* Blended Sea Winds (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/marineocean-data/blended-global/blended-sea-winds)
* Local Climatological Data (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/lcd)
* Storm Events Database (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/)

## Help/Getting Started

Documentation is at https://docs.ropensci.org/rnoaa/, and there are many vignettes in the package itself, available in your R session, or on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=rnoaa). The tutorials:

* **Getting started - start here**
* NOAA Buoy vignette
* NOAA National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) vignette (examples)
* NOAA NCDC attributes vignette
* NOAA NCDC workflow vignette
* Sea ice vignette
* Severe Weather Data Inventory (SWDI) vignette
* Historical Observing Metadata Repository (HOMR) vignette

## netcdf data

Some functions use netcdf files, including:

* `ersst`
* `buoy`
* `bsw`
* `argo`
 
You'll need the `ncdf4` package for those functions, and those only. `ncdf4` is in Suggests in this package, meaning you only need `ncdf4` if you are using any of the functions listed above. You'll get an informative error telling you to install `ncdf4` if you don't have it and you try to use the those functions. Installation of `ncdf4` should be straightforward on any system. See https://cran.r-project.org/package=ncdf4

## NOAA NCDC Datasets

There are many NOAA NCDC datasets. All data sources work, except `NEXRAD2` and `NEXRAD3`, for an unknown reason. This relates to `ncdc_*()` functions only.

**NOAA NCDC Attributes**

Each NOAA dataset has a different set of attributes that you can potentially get back in your search. See https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets for detailed info on each dataset. We provide some information on the attributes in this package; see the vignette for attributes (https://docs.ropensci.org/rnoaa/articles/ncdc_attributes.html) to find out more

* removed checks on Ubuntu 16.04. Replaced with checks on latest Ubuntu version


rnoaa 1.3.4
===========

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* update URL for tornadoes data to include data from 2019 (#386) thanks @ryanscharf

### BUG FIXES

* fix for all `ncdc*` functions - response header content type changed - we had a check for proper content type - that check is now more general so that any json content type will be okay (#390)

rnoaa 1.3.2
===========

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* remove ropenaq from Suggests as its been archived on CRAN (#385)
* test fixes (#382)

rnoaa 1.3
=========

### NEW FEATURES

* `ghcnd()` now accepts more than 1 station identifier (#373) PR from @eliocamp
* `ersst()`: use new v5 version of their service - see `?ersst` docs for details (#381) thanks @vonStadarhraun for the tip

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* update `buoy()` docs to state that a special value of `9999` passsed to the `year` parameter will give the most up to date data (aka current data) - and an example added using it (#377)
* update to current dplyr functions from deprecated ones (#375)
* update description of units TMAX and TMIN for dataset GHCND when using function `ncdc()` with `add_units = TRUE` (#378) (#379) PR from @amcdavid

### BUG FIXES

* changed `ghcnd()` handling of unknown/bad/invalid station identifiers: now returns an empty data.frame and gives back empty strings for the two attributes `source` and `file_modified`  (#374)

rnoaa 1.2.0
===========

### DEFUNCT

* The following IBTrACS storm functions are now defunct because they are too cumbersome to maintain: `storm_data()`, `storm_meta()`, `storm_shp()`, and `storm_shp_read()`. associated package datasets `storm_columns` and `storm_names` removed  (#306)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* vignettes are now all pre-built, and all URLs are now unlinked (#367)
* `lcd()` returns a tibble now instead of a tibble with S3 class `lcd` attached (#369)
* created manual file entry for `stormevents_cache`
* drop `sf` from Suggests, only used in an example

rnoaa 1.1.0
===========

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* fix coops test (#364)
* remove deprecated parameters in argo and ncdc* functions (#361)

rnoaa 1.0.0
===========

### NEW FEATURES

* the `argo` functions that were not working because of a down API are working again, see `?argo` (#358)
* most of the defunct functions have been removed from the package, but are still referenced in the `?rnoaa-defunct` manual file. `gefs` functions are still in the package as those functions may come back at some point. (#359)
* two things for `arc2()`: 1) now accepts more than 1 date; 2) gains new parameter `box` to accept a bounding box to spatially filter results (uses `dplyr::filter` on the data.frame of spatial data) (#351)

### Documentation

Regarding the documentation site at https://docs.ropensci.org/rnoaa

* the function reference page https://docs.ropensci.org/rnoaa/reference/index.html has been improved; grouping functions by topic area and data source - for easier browsing (#360)
* a getting started vignette has been added, see the "Get Started" tab (#357)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* `ghncd()` (and all functions that build on `ghcnd()`) can now be altered to use a specific base URL for requests. See the "Base URL" section of the `?ghcnd` docs (#353)
* `ghcnd_splitvars()` speedup, using `data.table` instead of dplyr for manipulation (#352) (#355)
* use `tibble::as_tibble` throughout package instead of `dplyr::tbl_df` (#354)

### BUG FIXES

* fix for `ghcnd_stations()`: internal method `get_inventory()` was not creating a directory first before trying to download a file into that directory (#349) (#350)


rnoaa 0.9.6
===========

### NEW FEATURES

* new function `rnoaa_options()` to toggle package level options; only option for now is `cache_messages`, a boolean to toggle whether the user gets messages about cached files or not. along with this change, messages about cached files and file sizes and locations are now consistently used across all functions that cache files on disk  (#331)
* new manual file `?rnoaa_caching` - with information on how to access and manage cached files for each of the rnoaa functions that caches files on disk (#346)
* `isd()` moved to using `hoardr` caching - see `?isd_cache` for details (#347)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* remove internal code in many exported functions looking for user input `path` parameter and telling them it's no longer used; been defunct for quite a while
* now able to cache http requests for tests that write to disk (#290) (#345)
* `ghcnd_stations()` now caching data - first time requests should now take just over 1 minute, with subsequent requests (assuming cached data isn't deleted) taking ~ 3 seconds  (#164)
* `autoplot` method `meteo_coverage()` fix to visually display gaps in data (#314) (#333) thanks @philipshirk

### BUG FIXES

* fix for ncdc functions to fail better - NOAA was returning HTML on request failures instead of JSON - catch that better and give proper http status code response (#338)
* `meteo_nearby_stations()` fix: coerce input data.frame to the function to a data.frame before remainder of steps - in case user inputs a tibble (#340)
* `coops_search()` fix: when `product=predictions`, we get no metadata back - so just dont adjust times  (#342)
* `lcd()` changes: gains `lcd_cache` for managing cached files; use a new internal function for safely reading each csv file, with more informative error messages;  (#344)
* `meteo_pull_monitors()` fix: changed internals of `meteo_tidy_ghcnd()` to set -9999 values to NA slightly differently to avoi failing (#348)


rnoaa 0.9.5
===========

### BUG FIXES

* `lcd()` function was unfortunately pulling data from `https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-hourly/access` - whereas it should have been pulling data from `https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/local-climatological-data/access` - fixed now; additionaly, `lcd_cleanup` is defunct because lcd data coming from the appropriate link has all variable names spelled out and data split up (#334) thanks @sayon000 !
* all `gefs*` functions are now defunct - they are being taken out for now until fixed - see the issues for the details (#335) (#336)


rnoaa 0.9.4
===========

### NEW FEATURES

* new gefs function helpers `gefs_dimensions` and `gefs_ensembles` (#327) (#328)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* `gefs` function fixes: fixed failing test on CRAN having to do with a date mismatch; `gefs` now cleans up temporary files  (#327) (#328)

### BUG FIXES

* Some argo buoy functions use an API and some use an FTP server. The API is down, and no longer exists. The funitons that use the API (`argo_search`, `argo_files`, `argo_qwmo`, `argo_plan`) no longer work, while the functions that use the FTP server still work (`argo_buoy_files`, `argo`)  (#333)


rnoaa 0.9.2
===========

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* gefs gains new parameters `ens` and `time`, that will eventually replace the deprecated parameters `ens_idx` and `time_idx`  (#321) (#324)
* `isd()` now using fetching data using http instead of ftp

### BUG FIXES

* fix to `tornadoes()`: the URL had changed yet again (#322) (#323) thanks @mbjoseph !
* fix to gefs, was failing with some examples (#320) (#321)


rnoaa 0.9.0
===========

### NEW FEATURES

* gains `sea_ice_tabular()` function for fetching tabular .csv sea ice files instead of using the shp files in `sea_ice()` (#194)
* `seaice()` fxn name has changed to `sea_ice()` (#313)
* `sea_ice()` gains option to fetch GeoTIFF format data in addition to shp files (#219) (#313)
* gains new function `lcd_cleanup()` - takes output of call to `lcd()`, parsing additional columns that contain comma separated strings (#283)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* update README to link to ncdf4 pkg instead of ncdf pkg, and a note about which functions in rnoaa use ncdf4 (b/c ncdf4 is in Suggests) (#299) thanks @denrou
* now using markdown docs (#301)
* update `isd()` docs to highlight that cached files downloaded with the fxn will be used until deleted by the user! See `?isd` docs for details (#205)
* lat/lon param definition in `gefs` only mentioned longitude, now both vars discussed (#317) (#318)
* improve docs for `ncdc()` regarding units, and in readme and vignette as well (#265) (#315) from @amoeba

### BUG FIXES

* fix bug in `cpc_prcp()`: should have allowed dates back to 1948, but only allowed back to 1979 (#300)
* fix to `buoy()` fxn: datasets that did not have lat/lon variables were failing to be parsed by the fxn; now when lat/lon vars missing, we just give. back ncdf4 object for the user to deal with themselves (#303) (#304)
* fix to `gefs()`: longitude on the (-180, 180) scale worked but not on the (0,360) scale (#316) (#318) (#319)
* fix to `tornadoes()`: the URL for the data had changed (#311) (#312) thanks @mbjoseph
* `ncdc()` parameters `startdate`/`enddate` weren't handling dates as input values; now handle date and character inputs  (#307)
* fixed issue in `ghcnd_stations()`; there was an encoding issue with the data returned from NOAA (#305)


rnoaa 0.8.4
===========

### US federal government shutdown

This very long US federal government shutdown has allowed time for building in nicer failure behavior and more documentation for government shutdowns. There's a number of related changes:

* better government shutdown failure behavior for the `swdi()` function (#298)
* better government shutdown failure behavior for the `lcd()` function (#295)
* better failure behavior for all `ncdc*()` functions (#293) (#297)
* added a package level manual file section "Where data comes from and government shutdowns"

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* `swdi()`: changed from downloading data with `download.file` to `crul` (#298)
* fix `arc2()` tests to not have hard-coded dates (#294)


rnoaa 0.8.2
===========

### BUG FIXES

* improvements in failing well when there's a US government shutdown for many functions that work with web REST APIs (#293) (#295)
* fix to `arc2` tests to not be sensitive to the real year that the test is run in, reported in CRAN checks and via email (#294)


rnoaa 0.8.0
===========

### NEW FEATURES

* gains function `bsw()` for Blended Sea Winds data (#246)
* gains function `ghcnd_read()` - to read .dly files directly, e.g., files already downloaded (#223) thanks @shabbychef for the feature request
* gains function `lcd()` for Local Climatological Data (#212)
* gains functions `se_data()` and `se_files()` for the Storm Events Database  (#282)
* `ghcnd()` and `ghcnd_search()` gain a `refresh` parameter to refresh data for the query even if it's already cached locally. in addition, these functions now print messages to tell the user what file path the data is locally cached in, and the min and max dates when using `ghcnd_search()` (#269) thanks @kgmccann
* `ncdc()` gains `add_units` parameter (boolean) to toggle adding units to the output data.frame. default is `add_units=FALSE`. if `add_units=TRUE` we match dataset id and data type id and return units if we have them. do be in touch if you see a problem with these units! `ncdc()` now returns tibbles in the `data` slot (#233) (#266) (#289) (#287)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* spelling fixes to `coops` docs (#228) thanks @jsta
* fix in `ghcnd_search()` to arrange data by day instead of by month (#247) thanks @asrivas3 for reporting
* move `swdi()` to use `xml2` and `crul` packages instead of `XML` and `httr` (#275)
* added `swdi()` tests (#239) thanks @kevin-ht-ho
* `isd_stations_search()` no longer renames lat and lon column names (#238) thanks @kevin-ht-ho
* add codemeta keywords to description (#287)
* replace `httr` with `crul` throughout package (#186)
* many tests use `vcr` now for caching, more to do waiting on `vcr` being able to handle direct to disk use cases and binary files like pdfs (#284)
* fix links in Code of Conduct

### BUG FIXES

* fixes to `gefs()`. was incorrectly repeating time values within ensembles when it should have repeated time values across ensembles so that each ensemble has a time value for each time period (#230) (#231) thanks for report from @lcsma and fix by @potterzot
* fix bug in `ncdc()` - fix to internal function `parse_ncdc()`, which was failing on `strsplit()` call if attributes was `NULL` (#232) thanks for reporting @andypicke
* fix to `cpc_prcp()`: URLs were changed at some point, fixes for this (#242) 
* fix to `cpc_prcp()`: to read `.gz` files correctly with gzfile instead of file (#248)
* fix in `homr()` - NOAA server gives back a 200 OK response even if that's not the case - but we can check content type to see if there was likely an error (#250)
* fix to `autoplot.meteo_coverage` (#258)
* fix to `buoy_stations()`: was getting the wrong station ids - fixed; and use async HTTP requests to get data faster (#261) thanks @johnharley for the bug report
* fix to `ghcnd_stations()`: was returning an extra empty row  (#267) thanks @joeroe for the bug report
* related to (#267), `ghcnd()` was giving a trailing row of NA's - fixed (#270)
* `swdi()`: `radius` parameter doesn't work, update docs to tell users not to use it (#243)

* fix `meteo_nearby_stations()` to coerce character to numeric lat and lon values (#257) thanks @mondorescue for the bug report
* fix to `meteo_nearby_stations()` - internally ignored the user supplied column names for lat and lon (#286) thanks @ghaines3 for the bug report
* fixed `tornadoes()` for Windows OS's: `utils::untar()` was failing on windows, changed to using `utils::unzip()` (#203)
* fixed `argo_buoy_files()`: use `fill=TRUE` in the `read.table` call - was erroring on some Windows OS's (#235) thanks @jonmcalder for reporting


rnoaa 0.7.0
===========

Note that some NOAA datasets have changed names:

* `GHCNDMS` is now `GSOM` (Global Summary of the Month)
* `ANNUAL` is now `GSOY` (Global Summary of the Year)

### NEW FEATURES

* `isd()` gains new parameters `additional` to toggle whether the 
non-mandatory ISD fields (additional + remarks) are parsed and 
returned & `force` to toggle whether download new version or use
cached version. `isd_read()` gains new parameter `additional` 
(see description above) (#190)
* New function for Climate Prediction Center data: `cpc_prcp()` (#193)
* New function `arc2()` to get data from Africa Rainfall Climatology 
version 2 (#201)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* A number of NOAA services now use `https` - changed internal code 
to use `https` from `http` for coops, swdi, ersst, and tornadoes
data sources (#187)
* Changes to sea ice URLs - just internal (#185)
* Fixes to `coops_search()` to handle requests better: only certain
date combinations allowed for certain COOPS products (#213) (#214) 
thanks @tphilippi !
* Now using `hoardr` package to manage caching in some functions. Will
roll out to all functions that cache soon (#191)
* README img location fix requested by CRAN (#207)
* `GHCNDMS` is now `GSOM` and `ANNUAL` is now `GSOY` - added to docs
and examples of using GSOM and GSOY (#189)

### BUG FIXES

* A number of fixes to `isd()` (#168)
* Fixes to `coops_search()` to fix time zone problems (#184) thanks @drf5n
* Fixes to `ghcnd()` - fix some column types that were of inappropriate
type before (#211)
* Fix to `ghcnd()`: we were coercing factors to integers, which caused
nonsense output - first coercing to character now, then integer (#221)
* There were problems in parsing flags (attributes) for some datasets 
via `ncdc()` function. Added metadata to the package to help parse 
flags (#199)


rnoaa 0.6.6
===========

### NEW FEATURES

* `isd()` now using a new package `isdparser` to parse
NOAA ISD files. We still fetch the file within `rnoaa`, but the
file parsing is done by `isdparser` (#176) (#177) (#180) thanks @mrubayet
for the push

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Fixed precipitation units in docs for `meteo_*` functions (#178)
thanks @mrubayet

### BUG FIXES

* Fixed bug in `ghcnd()` where internal unexported function
was not found (#179)
* Fix to `isd_stations()` and `isd_stations_search()` to work
correctly on Windows (#181) thanks @GuodongZhu
* Changed base URL for all NOAA NCDC functions (those starting with
`ncdc`) to `https` from `http` (#182) thanks @maspotts
* Changed base URL for all NOAA HOMR functions (those starting with
`homr`) to `https` from `http` (#183)


rnoaa 0.6.5
===========

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Added notes to docs of functions that do file caching - where
to find cached files.
* `meteo_clear_cache` gains parameter `force` to control `force`
parameter in `unlink()`
* Removed `lubridate` usage in `seaiceurls()` function, just using
base R functions.

### BUG FIXES

* Fixed bug which was affecting binary installs only. We accidentally
determined a path on package build, such that the user
of the CRAN binary build machine got inserted into the path.
This is now fixed. (#173)


rnoaa 0.6.4
===========

### NEW FEATURES

* New function `isd_read()` to read ISD output from `isd()` manually
instead of letting `isd()` read in the data. This is useful when you
use `isd()` but need to read the file in later when it's already cached.
(#169)
* Some functions in `rnoaa` cache files that are downloaded from
various NOAA web services. File caching is usually done when data comes
from FTP servers. In some of these functions where we cache data, we used
to write to your home directory, but have now changed all these functions
to write to a proper cache directory in a platform independent way.
We determine the cache directory using `rappdirs::user_cache_dir()`.
Note that this may change your workflow if you'd been depending on
cached files to be a in particular place on your file system. In addition,
the `path` parameter in the changed functions is now defunct, but you
get an informative warning about it (#171)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* `storm_data()` now returns a tibble/data.frame not inside of a list. We used
to return a list with a single slot `data` with a data.frame, but this was
unnecessary.
* `ghcnd_stations()` now outputs a data.frame (`tbl_df`) by itself,
instead of a data.frame nested in a list. This may change how
you access data from this function. (#163)
* Improved docs on token usage for NCDC functions (with prefix
`ncdc_*()`) (#167)
* Added note to `isd()` docs that when you get an error similar to
`Error: download failed for ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/1955/011490-99999-1955.gz`,
the file does not exist on NOAA's ftp servers. If your internet is down,
you'll get a different error saying as much (#170)

rnoaa 0.6.0
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* A large PR was merged with a suite of functions. Most functions added
a prefixed with `meteo_*`, and are meant to find weather monitors near
locations (`meteo_nearby_stations`), find all monitors within a radius
of a location (`meteo_distance`), calculate the distances between a
location and all available stations (`meteo_process_geographic_data`),
calculate the distance between two locations (`meteo_spherical_distance`),
pull GHCND weather data for multiple weather monitors (`meteo_pull_monitors`),
create a tidy GHCND dataset from a single monitor (`meteo_tidy_ghcnd`),
and determine the "coverage" for a station data frame (`meteo_coverage()`).
In addition, `vis_miss()` added to visualize missingness in a data.frame. See
the [PR diff against master](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa/pull/159/files)
for all the changes. (#159) Thanks a ton to @geanders _et al_. (@hrbrmstr,
@maelle, @jdunic, @njtierney, @leighseverson, @RyanGan, @mandilin, @jferreri,
@cpatrizio88, @ryan-hicks, @Ewen2015, @mgutilla, @hakessler, @rodlammers)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* `isd_stations_search()` changed internal structure. We replaced
usage of `geojsonio` and `lawn` for faster `dplyr::filter` for
bbox inputs, and `meteo_distance()` for `lat/long/radius` inputs
. This speeds up this function significantly. Thanks to @lukas-rokka
(#157)
* `isd_stations_search()` and `isd_stations()` now return
tibble's instead of data.frame's
* Removed cached ISD stations dataset within package to reduce
package size. Only change is now that on first use of the function
the user has to download the entire thing, but on subsquent
uses it will pull from the cached version on the users machine.
`isd_stations_search()` now caches using `rappdirs` (#161)
* Convert all `is()` uses to `inherits()`

### BUG FIXES

* Fixed `seaiceeurls()` function that's used to generate urls for
the `seaice()` function - due to change in NOAA urls (#160)
* Fix to function `ghncd_split_vars()` to not fail on `dplyr::contains`
call (#156) thanks @lawinslow !

rnoaa 0.5.6
===============

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Fixes for new `httr` version to call encoding explicitly (#135)
* Fix to broken link for reference to source code used in `gefs` functions (#121)
* Speed ups implemented for the `isd()` function - it's a time consuming task
as we have to parse a nasty string of characters line by line - more speed
ups to come in future versions (#146)
* Replace `dplyr::rbind_all()` with `dplyr::bind_rows()` as the former is
being deprecated (#152)

### BUG FIXES

* Fix for `isd()` function - was failing on some station names that had
leading zeros. (#136)
* Fix for `ncdc_stations()` - used to allow more than one station id to
be passed in, but internally only handled one. This is a restriction
due to the NOAA NCDC API. Documentation now shows an example of how
to deal with many station ids (#138)
* Fixes to the suite of `ncdc_*()` functions to allow multiple inputs
to those parameters where allowed (#139)
* Fixed bug in `ncdc_plot()` due to new `ggplot2` version (#153)
* Fixed bugs in `argo()` functions: a) with new `httr`, box input of a vector
no longer works, now manually make a character vector; b) errant file param
being passed into the http request, removed (#155)

rnoaa 0.5.2
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* New data source added: ARGO buoy data. See functions starting with `argo()` (#123)
for more, see http://www.argo.ucsd.edu/
* New data source added: CO-OPS tide and current data. See function `coops_search()`
(#111) for idea from @fmichonneau (#124) for implementing @jsta 
also (#126) (#128)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* `rgdal` moved to Suggests to make usage easier (#125)
* Changes to `ncdc_plot()` - made default brakes to just default to what
`ggplot2` does, but you can still pass in your own breaks (#131)

rnoaa 0.5.0
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* New data source added: NOAA Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) data.
See functions `gefs()`, `gefs_dimension_values()`, `gefs_dimensions()`, `gefs_latitudes()`,
`gefs_longitudes()`, and `gefs_variables()` (#106) (#119)  thanks @potterzot - he's
now an author too
* New data source added: NOAA Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature
(ERSST) data. See function `ersst()` (#96)
* New function `isd_stations()` to get ISD station data.
* Added code of conduct to code repository

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Swapped `ncdf` package for `ncdf4` package. Windows binaries weren't
availiable for `ncdf4` prior to now. (#117)
* Proper license info added for javascript modules used inside the
package (#116)
* Improvements to `isd()` function to do transformations of certain
variables to give back data that makes more sense (#115)
* `leaflet`, `geojsonio`, and `lawn` added in Suggests, used in a few
functions.
* Note added to `swdi()` function man page that the `nldn` dataset is
available to military users only (#107)

### BUG FIXES

* Fix to `buoy()` function to accept character class inputs for the
`buoyid` parameter. the error occurred because matching was not
case-insensitive, now works regardless of case (#118)
* Fixes for new `ggplot2` version (#113)
* Built in `GET` request retries for `ghncd` functions as
some URLs fail unpredictably (#110)

rnoaa 0.4.2
===============

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Explicitly import non-base R pkg functions, so importing from `utils`, `methods`, and `stats` (#103)
* All NCDC legacy API functions are now defunct. See `?rnoaa-defunct` for more information (#104)
* `radius` parameter removed from `ncdc_stations()` function (#102), was already removed internally within the function in the last version, now not in the function definition, see also (#98) and (#99)
* Dropped `plyr` and `data.table` from imports. `plyr::rbind.fill()` and `data.table::rbindlist()` replaced with `dplyr::bind_rows()`.

### BUG FIXES

* Fixed problem with `httr` `v1` where empty list not allowed to pass to
the `query` parameter in `GET` (#101)

rnoaa 0.4.0
===============

### NEW FEATURES

+ Gains a suite of new functions for working with NOAA GHCND data, including
`ghcnd()`, `ghcnd_clear_cache()`, `ghcnd_countries()`, `ghcnd_search()`, `ghcnd_splitvars()`
`ghcnd_states()`, `ghcnd_stations()`, and `ghcnd_version()` (#85) (#86) (#87) (#88) (#94)
+ New contributor Adam Erickson (@DougFirErickson)
+ All NOAA buoy functions put back into the package. They were previously
on a separate branch in the GitHub repository. (#37) (#71) (#100)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

+ Minor adjustments to `isd()` functions, including better man file.
+ Cleaner package imports - importing mostly only functions used in dependencies.
+ Startup message gone.
+ `callopts` parameter changed to `...` in function `swdi()`.
+ More robust test suite.
+ `ncdc()` requires that users do their own paging - previously this was done internally (#77)
+ Many dependencies dropped, simplifying package: `RCurl`, `maptools`, `stringr`, `digest`.
A few new ones added: `dplyr`, `tidyr`.

### DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

+ All `erddap` functions now defunct - see the package [rerddap](https://github.com/ropensci/rerddap),
a general purpose R client for ERDDAP servers. (#51) (#73) (#90) (#95)
+ The `extent` function in `noaa_stations()` used to accept either a bounding
box or a point defined by lat/long. The lat/long option dropped as it required
two packages, one of which is a pain to install for many users (#98) (#99)

rnoaa 0.3.3
===============

### NEW FEATURES

+ New data source NOAA legacy API with ISD, daily, and ish data via function
`ncdc_legacy()`. (#54)
+ New function `isd()` to get ISD data from NOAA FTP server. (#76)
+ ERDDAP gridded data sets added. Now tabledap datasets are accessible via
`erddap_table()`, while gridded datasets are available via `erddap_grid()`. Helper
function `erddap_search()` was modified to search for either tabledap or griddap
datasets, and `erddap_info()` gets and prints summary information differently
for tabledap and griddap datasets. (#63)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

+ `erddap_data()` defunct, now as functions `erddap_table()` and `erddap_grid()`, uses new
`store` parameter which takes a function, either `disk(path, overwrite)` to store
on disk or `memory()` to store in R memory.
+ `assertthat` library removed, replaced with `stopifnot()`

rnoaa 0.3.0
===============

### NEW FEATURES

+ New data source added (NOAA torndoes data) via function `tornadoes()`. (#56)
+ New data source added (NOAA storm data from IBTrACS) via functions
`storm_*()`. (#57)
+ New data source added (NOAA weather station metadata from HOMR) via functions
`homr_*()` (#59)
+ New vignettes for storm data and homr data.
+ Some functions in rnoaa now print data.frame outputs as `dplyr`-like outputs
with a summary of the data.frame, as appropriate.

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

+ Across all `ncdc_*` functions changed `callopts` parameter to `...`. This parameter
allow you to pass in options to `httr::GET` to modify curl requests. (#61)
+ A new helper function `check_key()` looks for one of two stored keys, as an
environment variable under the name `NOAA_KEY`, or an option variable under the name
`noaakey`. Environment variables can be set during session like `Sys.setenv(VAR = "...")`,
or stored long term in your `.Renviron` file. Option variables can be set during session
like `options(var = "...")`, or stored long term in your `.Rprofile` file.
+ `is.*` and `print.*` functions no longer have public man files, but can be seen via
`rnoaa:::` if needed.

rnoaa 0.2.0
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* New package imports: `sp`, `rgeos`, `assertthat`, `jsonlite`, and `ncdf4`, and new package Suggests: `knitr`, `taxize`
* Most function names changed. All `noaa*()` functions for NCDC data changed to `ncdc*()`. `noaa_buoy()` changed to `buoy()`. `noaa_seaice()` changed to `seaice()`. When you call the old versions an error is thrown, with a message pointing you to the new function name. See ?rnoaa-defunct.
* New vignettes: NCDC attributes, NCDC workflow, Seaice vignette, SWDI vignette, ERDDAP vignette, NOAA buoy vignette.
* New functions to interact with NOAA ERDDAP data: `erddap_info()`, `erddap_data()`, and `erddap_search()`.
* New functions to interact with NOAA buoy data: `buoy()`, including a number of helper functions.
* `ncdc()` now splits apart attributes. Previously, the attributes were returned as a single column, but now there is column for each attribute so data can be easily retrieved. Attribute columns differ for each different `datasetid`.
* `buoy()` function has been removed from the CRAN version of `rnoaa`. Install the version with `buoy()` and associated functions via `devtools::install_github("ropensci/rnoaa", ref="buoy")`

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* `noaa_swdi()` (function changed to `swdi()`) gains new parameter `filepath` to specify path to write a file to if `format=kmz` or `format=shp`. Examples added for using `format=` csv, shp, and kmz.
* Now using internal version of `plyr::compact`.
* Added API response checker/handler to all functions to pass on helpful messages on server errors.
* `ncdc()` gains new parameter `includemetadata`. If TRUE, includes metadata, if not, does not, and response should be faster as does not take time to calculate metadata.
* `noaa_stations()` gains new parameter `radius`. If `extent` is a vector of length 4 (for a bounding box) then radius is ignored, but if you pass in two points to `extent`, it is interpreted as a point, and then `radius` is used as the distance upon which to construct a bounding box. `radius` default is 10 km.

### BUG FIXES

* `datasetid`, `startdate`, and `enddate` are often required parameters, and changes were made to help users with this.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

-----

This version updates the writing locations to comply with CRAN policy by switching from using rappdirs::user_cache_dir("rnoaa/ersst") to using tools::R_user_dir("rnoaa/ersst", which = "cache").

The previous release had missed a use of rappdirs::user_cache_dir in the tests.

Thanks!
