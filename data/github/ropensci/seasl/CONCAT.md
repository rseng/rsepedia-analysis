`seasl` is an R client for exploring CSL styles.

This package is inspired by the Ruby gem `csl`: https://github.com/inukshuk/csl-ruby

The Citation Style Language 1.0.1 specification: http://docs.citationstyles.org/en/1.0.1/specification.html

Package API:

 - `csl_locales`
 - `as.location`
 - `csl_styles`
 - `csl_locale_exists`
 - `csl_cache`
 - `csl_fetch_styles`
 - `csl_style_find`
 - `csl_style_xml`
 - `csl_style_load`
 - `csl_style_exists`
 - `csl_locale_load`
 - `csl_fetch_locales`

## Install


```r
install.packages("seasl")
```

or


```r
remotes::install_github("ropensci/seasl")
```


```r
library("seasl")
```

## Download styles and locales

First, you may want to download style and locale files. `csl_fetch_styles()` and `csl_fetch_locales()`
download the files to your machine. See `?csl_cache` for caching information, including
how to change the cache location.

Styles retrieved from the Github repo at https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles-distribution


```r
csl_fetch_styles()
#>
#> Done! Files put in /Users/sckott/Library/Caches/R/seasl/styles
```

Locales retrieved from the Github repo at https://github.com/citation-style-language/locales


```r
csl_fetch_locales()
#>
#> Done! Files put in /Users/sckott/Library/Caches/R/seasl/locales
```

## File paths to CSL styles and locales

calling `csl_styles` without inputs gives all styles, with separate lists for 
dependent and independent styles


```r
csl_styles()
#> $independent
#>    [1] "academy-of-management-review"                                                                                        
#>    [2] "accident-analysis-and-prevention"                                                                                    
#>    [3] "aci-materials-journal"                                                                                               
#>    [4] "acm-sig-proceedings-long-author-list"                                                                                
#>    [5] "acm-sig-proceedings"                                                                                                 
#>    [6] "acm-sigchi-proceedings-extended-abstract-format"                                                                     
#>    [7] "acm-sigchi-proceedings"                                                                                              
#>    [8] "acm-siggraph"                                                                                                        
#>    [9] "acme-an-international-journal-for-critical-geographies"                                                              
...
```

calling `csl_styles` with an input gives the path to that style, if found


```r
csl_styles("apa")
#> [1] "/Users/sckott/Library/Caches/R/seasl/styles/apa.csl"
csl_styles("archeologie-medievale")
#> [1] "/Users/sckott/Library/Caches/R/seasl/styles/archeologie-medievale.csl"
```

Same patterns go for locales (note that there are far fewer locales than styles)


```r
# just locale names
csl_locales()
#>  [1] "locales-af-ZA" "locales-ar"    "locales-bg-BG" "locales-ca-AD"
#>  [5] "locales-cs-CZ" "locales-cy-GB" "locales-da-DK" "locales-de-AT"
#>  [9] "locales-de-CH" "locales-de-DE" "locales-el-GR" "locales-en-GB"
#> [13] "locales-en-US" "locales-es-CL" "locales-es-ES" "locales-es-MX"
#> [17] "locales-et-EE" "locales-eu"    "locales-fa-IR" "locales-fi-FI"
#> [21] "locales-fr-CA" "locales-fr-FR" "locales-he-IL" "locales-hr-HR"
#> [25] "locales-hu-HU" "locales-id-ID" "locales-is-IS" "locales-it-IT"
#> [29] "locales-ja-JP" "locales-km-KH" "locales-ko-KR" "locales-la"   
#> [33] "locales-lt-LT" "locales-lv-LV" "locales-mn-MN" "locales-nb-NO"
#> [37] "locales-nl-NL" "locales-nn-NO" "locales-pl-PL" "locales-pt-BR"
#> [41] "locales-pt-PT" "locales-ro-RO" "locales-ru-RU" "locales-sk-SK"
#> [45] "locales-sl-SI" "locales-sr-RS" "locales-sv-SE" "locales-th-TH"
#> [49] "locales-tr-TR" "locales-uk-UA" "locales-vi-VN" "locales-zh-CN"
#> [53] "locales-zh-TW"
```


```r
# when locale given, you get the full path
csl_locales("fr-FR")
#> [1] "/Users/sckott/Library/Caches/R/seasl/locales/locales-fr-FR.xml"
```

Alternatively, you can try to find a style by using `csl_style_find()`


```r
# single match
csl_style_find(x = "American Journal of Epidemiology")
#> [1] "/Users/sckott/Library/Caches/R/seasl/styles/american-journal-of-epidemiology.csl"
```


```r
# many matches
csl_style_find(x = "American Journal")
#>  [1] "/Users/sckott/Library/Caches/R/seasl/styles/american-journal-of-agricultural-economics.csl"                                     
#>  [2] "/Users/sckott/Library/Caches/R/seasl/styles/american-journal-of-archaeology.csl"                                                
#>  [3] "/Users/sckott/Library/Caches/R/seasl/styles/american-journal-of-botany.csl"                                                     
#>  [4] "/Users/sckott/Library/Caches/R/seasl/styles/american-journal-of-climate-change.csl"

#>  [7] "/Users/sckott/Library/Caches/R/seasl/styles/american-journal-of-epidemiology.csl"                                               
#>  [8] "/Users/sckott/Library/Caches/R/seasl/styles/american-journal-of-health-behavior.csl"                                            
#>  [9] "/Users/sckott/Library/Caches/R/seasl/styles/american-journal-of-hypertension.csl"                                               
#> [10] "/Users/sckott/Library/Caches/R/seasl/styles/american-journal-of-medical-genetics.csl"

# CONTRIBUTING #

### Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using
the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.

*  YES: you edit a roxygen comment in a `.R` file below `R/`.
*  NO: you edit an `.Rd` file below `man/`.

### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure someone from the team agrees that itâ€™s a problem. If youâ€™ve found a
bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal 
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

### Pull request process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  
*  Look at the Travis and AppVeyor build status before and after making changes.
The `README` should contain badges for any continuous integration services used
by the package.  
*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2).  
*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). Contributions
with test cases included are easier to accept.  
*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the
current development version header describing the changes made followed by your
GitHub username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).
