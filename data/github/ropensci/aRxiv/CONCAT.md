# aRxiv

[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](
https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)
[![CRAN_Status_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/aRxiv)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=aRxiv)

## R interface to arXiv

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org) is a repository of electronic preprints for
computer science, mathematics, physics, quantitative biology,
quantitative finance, and statistics. The
[aRxiv](https://github.com/ropensci/aRxiv) package is an R interface to
the [arXiv API](https://arxiv.org/help/api/index).

Note that the arXiv API _does not_ require an API key.

__Installation instructions__
__Stable Version__

You can install the package via [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org):

```r
install.packages("aRxiv")
```

__Development Version__

Or use `devtools::install_github()` to get the (more recent) version
at [GitHub](https://github.com/rOpenSci/aRxiv):

```r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("ropensci/aRxiv")
```

## Usage
### Basic usage

The main function is `arxiv_search()`. Here's an example of its use:

```r
library(aRxiv)
z <- arxiv_search(query = 'au:"Peter Hall" AND cat:stat*', limit=50)
str(z)
```


### Tutorial

An aRxiv tutorial is available at the rOpenSci website, [here](https://docs.ropensci.org/aRxiv/articles/aRxiv.html).

To view the tutorial from R, use:

```r
vignette("aRxiv", "aRxiv")
```

This package is part of a richer suite called [fulltext](https://github.com/ropensci/fulltext), along with several other packages, that provides the ability to search for and retrieve full text of open access scholarly articles. We recommend using `fulltext` as the primary R interface to `arXiv` unless your needs are limited to this single source.

## Script for [aRxiv](http://github.com/ropensci/aRxiv) package

[`grab_api_manual_tables.R`](http://github.com/ropensci/aRxiv/tree/master/inst/scripts/grab_api_manual_tables.R)
&ndash; R script to grab tables from the
[arXiv API user guide](http://arxiv.org/help/api/index).

- search terms (`query_prefixes`)
- subject classifications (`arxiv_cats`)

The script creates datasets for the package that contain the body of the tables.

To access the resulting datasets, do the following:

```r
library(aRxiv)
data(query_prefixes)
data(arxiv_cats)
```
