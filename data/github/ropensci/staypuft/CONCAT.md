[![Project Status: Active – The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)
[![R-check](https://github.com/ropensci/staypuft/workflows/R-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ropensci/staypuft/actions/)

`staypuft` is a port of Python's [marshmallow][] for converting objects to and from R data structures 

Main `Schema` methods:
- `load`: 'deserialize', or validate and deserialize an input R data structure (e.g., list) to an object
- `dump`: 'serialize', or convert any input (e.g., R6 class) to R data structures (e.g., list)
- `load_json`: same as `load`, but accepts JSON
- `dump_json`: same as `dump`, but returns JSON

## Installation


```r
remotes::install_github("ropensci/staypuft")
```


```r
library("staypuft")
```

## example


```r
z <- Schema$new("MySchema",
  name = fields$character(),
  title = fields$character(),
  num = fields$integer()
)
z
#> <schema: MySchema>
#> fields: name, title, num
x <- list(name = "Jane Doe", title = "Howdy doody", num = 5.5)
z$load(data = x)
#> $name
#> [1] "Jane Doe"
#> 
#> $title
#> [1] "Howdy doody"
#> 
#> $num
#> [1] 5.5
```

<!-- Please use a feature branch (i.e., put your work in a new branch that has a name that reflects the feature you are working on; https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/workflow.html) -->

<!-- If you've updated a file in the man-roxygen directory, make sure to update the man/ files by running devtools::document() or similar as .Rd files should be affected by your change -->

<!--- Provide a general summary of your changes in the Title above -->

## Description
<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->

## Related Issue
<!--- if this closes an issue make sure include e.g., "fix #4"
or similar - or if just relates to an issue make sure to mention
it like "#4" -->

## Example
<!--- if introducing a new feature or changing behavior of existing
methods/functions, include an example if possible to do in brief form -->

<!--- Did you remember to include tests? Unless you're just changing
grammar, please include new tests for your change -->

# CONTRIBUTING #

### Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using
the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.

*  YES: you edit a roxygen comment in a `.R` file below `R/`.
*  NO: you edit an `.Rd` file below `man/`.

### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s a problem. If you’ve found a
bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal 
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

### Pull request process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  
*  Look at the Travis and AppVeyor build status before and after making changes.
The `README` should contain badges for any continuous integration services used
by the package.  
*  We recommend the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org).
You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to
apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with 
your PR.  
*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2).  
*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). Contributions
with test cases included are easier to accept.  
*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the
current development version header describing the changes made followed by your
GitHub username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).

### Discussion forum

Check out our [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) if you think your issue requires a longer form discussion.

### Prefer to Email?
