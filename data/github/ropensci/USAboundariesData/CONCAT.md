\description{
This \code{sf} object contains historical population data for U.S. cities
with latitudes and longitudes of the cities. The data is drawn from the U.S.
Census. The data was compiled by Erik Steiner and Jason Heppler at the Center
for Spatial and Textual Analysis, Stanford University. See their
\href{https://github.com/cestastanford/historical-us-city-populations}{description
of the data} for a fuller accounting of how the data was gathered.

\description{
These datasets contain polygons for historical boundaries in the United
States. These boundaries are taken from the Atlas of Historical County
Boundaries. State boundaries cover the period from 1783 to 2000, and county
boundaries cover the period from 1629 to 2000. The attribute data includes of
the changes to the boundaries and the dates with which they valid. For a full
description of all of the columns in the data frame, see the
\href{http://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp/downloads/united_states.html}{documentation
in the zip files} provided by AHCB. The datasets are objects of class
\code{sf} from the \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf}{sf package}.
They are intended to be used with the functions in the \code{USAboundaries}
package, but the data objects can also be used on their own. The data
attributes associated with these boundaries are unchanged from what is
available in the AHCB shapefiles files, with the exception that
\code{state_name}, \code{state_abbreviation}, and \code{state_code} columns
have been added where necessary for convience in filtering the boundaries.
}
\details{
The high resolution boundaries have been generalized to a .01 degree
  tolerance	(1:2,500,000; 1 inch = 39 miles). The low resolution boundaries
  have been generalized to a .05 degree tolerance (1:12,500,000; 1 inch = 197
  miles). See the AHCB website for higher-resolution shapefiles.

  See the
  \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=USAboundaries}{USAboundaries
  package} for low-resolution state boundaries and for the functions to
  access this data.

The U.S. Census Bureau provides
\href{https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-cart-boundary.html}{cartographic
boundary files} for current U.S. boundaries. The datasets in this package
provide a selection of boundaries from the 2020 Census files. They are
objects of class \code{sf} from the
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf}{sf package}. They are intended
to be used with the functions in the \code{USAboundaries} package, but the
data objects can also be used on their own. The data attributes associated
with these boundaries are unchanged from what is available in the Census
boundary files, with the exception that \code{state_name} and
\code{state_abbreviation} columns have been added where necessary for
convience in filtering the boundaries.
