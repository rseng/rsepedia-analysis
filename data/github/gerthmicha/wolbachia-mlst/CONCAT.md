Data from Bleidorn &amp; Gerth (2017)

This repository contains the data analysed and discussed in [Bleidorn & Gerth (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fix163). Specifically, all 252 single copy *Wolbachia* gene alignments, along with those of the 5 MLST loci are provided in the directory [alignments](https://github.com/gerthmicha/wolbachia-mlst/tree/master/alignments). All corresponding tree files can be found in [trees](https://github.com/gerthmicha/wolbachia-mlst/tree/master/trees), and the PI profiles for the loci are located in [profiles](https://github.com/gerthmicha/wolbachia-mlst/tree/master/profiles). Trees were calculated with [IQ-TREE](http://www.iqtree.org/) and PI profiles with [TAPIR](https://github.com/faircloth-lab/tapir). Please refer to [Bleidorn & Gerth (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fix163) and [Gerth & Bleidorn (2016)](http://rdcu.be/t8tX) for more details.
