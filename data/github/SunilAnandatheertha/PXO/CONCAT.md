# Contributing to PXO

A big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to PXO repository! It’s people like you that make it a reality for users in the open reseacrh community

Reading and following these guidelines will help us make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved. It also communicates that you agree to respect the time of the developers managing and developing these open source projects. In return, we will reciprocate that respect by addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Code of Conduct

We take our open source community seriously and hold ourselves and other contributors to high standards of communication. By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/auth0/open-source-template/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- To report security vulnerabilities, please use our [Responsible Disclosure Program](https://auth0.com/whitehat) which is monitored by our security team.
- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.
- If you've never contributed before, see [the first timer's guide on our blog](https://auth0.com/blog/a-first-timers-guide-to-an-open-source-project/) for resources and tips on how to get started.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our libraries are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation in the repo or on our [docs site](https://auth0.com/docs).
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

### INTRODUCTION
**PXO** stands for Poly-XTAL Operations. It is an open-source, MATLAB codebase for generating, analyzing and exporting complex space partitions such as multi-phase metallic grain structures. Poly-XTAL operations is named after the various operations which lead to its functionalities relating to poly-crystalline structures. It is useful for mathematicians, statistical mechanists, material scientists and computational geologiests. Read the [MOTIVATION](https://github.com/SunilAnandatheertha/PXO/wiki/Motivation) for developing PXO, along with a set of [VALIDATION](https://github.com/SunilAnandatheertha/PXO/wiki/Validation) results, current [LIMITATIONS](https://github.com/SunilAnandatheertha/PXO/wiki/Limitations) of PXO, [Tutorials and Test Cases](https://github.com/SunilAnandatheertha/PXO/wiki/Tutorials-and-test-cases) which you can try out while learning to use. The paper can be found [here](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03190) In case you use MTEX and would like to expand your research scope by being able to generate your own custom grain structures and crystallographic textures, you can use PXO to do so. Please use the [DISCUSSION](https://github.com/SunilAnandatheertha/PXO/discussions) page to as questions/clarifications, put forth your ideas, feature requests, documentation requests and bug/issue reports. Please visit [HERE](https://github.com/SunilAnandatheertha/PXO/wiki/Installation-instructions) to see installation instructions.

Development and all documentations by: [Sunil Anandatheertha](https://sunilanandatheertha.github.io/). Please start with [wiki page](https://github.com/SunilAnandatheertha/PXO/wiki). It will direct you. To use PXO, no installation is needed yet. Just add the folder to MATLAB path and start using. Sponsorer information will be listed here in the reverse chronological order. Please go through [contributing.md](https://github.com/SunilAnandatheertha/PXO/blob/main/contributing.md) to see how you may contribute.

Contributor and sponsorer credits will be listed in detail here.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at . All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
