Repository for ArGSLab, Arrested and Gelated Structures Laboratory, Version 1.01.

The two folders "ArGSLab_Standalone" and "ArGSLab_GUI" each contain a version of ArGSLab. The Standalone version can be used without installation: users should only change "parameters.m", and run "main.m". The GUI version contains the interface, containing an intuitive access to the same functionalities of the Standalone version. Several example images can be found in the "Examples" folder.

The files "Example_image.tif" and "Example_walkthrough.pdf" are files designed to help familiarize with the functions and parameters of ArGSLab. "Example_image.tif" is an idealized, computer-generated image stack.

If one uses ArGSLab or part of ArGSLab for any publication, please cite our original work:
