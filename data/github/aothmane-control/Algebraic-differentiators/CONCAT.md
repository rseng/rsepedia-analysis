# AlgDiff
AlgDiff: A Python class that provides all necessary tools for the design, analysis, and discretization of algebraic differentiators. An interface to Matlab is also provided.

The toolbox is licensed under the BSD-3-Clause License, which is suitable for both academic and industrial/commercial purposes.
# Motivation 
Estimating the derivatives of noisy signals is of paramount importance in many
fields of engineering and applied mathematics. It is, however, a longstanding ill-posed
and challenging problem, in the sense that a small error in measurement data can
induce a significant error in the estimated derivatives.

Algebraic differentiators have been derived and discussed in the systems and control theory community. The initial works based on differential-algebraic methods have been developed by Mboup,  Join, and Fliess in [[1]](#1). These numerical, non-asymptotic approximation approaches
for higher-order derivatives of noisy signals are well suited for real-time embedded systems. 

The following figure shows the results of the numerical estimation of the first time derivative of a noisy signal based on an algebraic differentiator on the one hand and the simple difference quotient rule on the other. This simulation shows the excellent performance of this numerical differentiation approach.

Algebraic differentiators are linear time-invariant filters with a finite-duration impulse response. These filters can be approximated as lowpass filters with a known cutoff frequency and a stopband slope. The following figure presents the amplitude and phase spectra of two exemplary filters. The lowpass approximation is also shown.

See [[2]](#2), [[3]](#3), and [[4]](#4) for more details on the parametrization of these differentiators.

This code has been created for research purposes at the [Chair of Systems Theory and Control Engineering](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/chair/rudolph.html) of Saarland University, Germany.
 We apply algebraic differentiators to solve different problems related to control theory and signal processing: Parameter estimation, feedback control, fault detection and fault tolerant control, model-free control ...

# Prerequisites
The code is implemented in Python 3. To use all functionalities, the following packages are required: [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [mpmath](https://mpmath.org/), and [math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html). The examples implemented in Python are written in [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and require the packages [jupyter_latex_envs](https://github.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs) for the generation of useful documentations and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for the creation of plots. The functions in the toolbox can also be used in Matlab for which different examples are also included. Check the Matlab [documentation](https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-supported-python-implementation.html) for more details on the compatibility of your Matlab version with Python.

# How to use
The contribution of this implementation is an easy to use framework for the design and discretization of algebraic differentiators to achieve desired filter characteristics, i.e., to specify the cutoff frequency and the stopband slope. The file [algebraicDifferentiator.py](https://github.com/aothmane-control/Algebraic-differentiators/blob/master/algebraicDifferentiator.py) implements the class AlgebraicDifferentiator. This class contains all necessary functions for the design, analysis, and discretization of the differentiators.
