NiaAML is a framework for Automated Machine Learning based on nature-inspired algorithms for optimization. The framework is written fully in Python. The name NiaAML comes from the Automated Machine Learning method of the same name [[1]](#1). Its goal is to compose the best possible classification pipeline for the given task efficiently using components on the input. The components are divided into three groups: feature selection algorithms, feature transformation algorithms and classifiers. The framework uses nature-inspired algorithms for optimization to choose the best set of components for the classification pipeline, and optimize their hyperparameters. We use the <a href="https://github.com/NiaOrg/NiaPy">NiaPy framework</a> for the optimization process, which is a popular Python collection of nature-inspired algorithms. The NiaAML framework is easy to use and customize or expand to suit your needs.

The NiaAML framework allows you not only to run full pipeline optimization, but also to separate implemented components such as classifiers, feature selection algorithms, etc. **It supports numerical and categorical features as well as missing values in datasets.**

* **Free software:** MIT license,

## Installation

### pip3

Install NiaAML with pip3:

```sh
pip3 install niaaml
```

In case you would like to try out the latest pre-release version of the framework, install it using:

```sh
pip3 install niaaml --pre
```

### Fedora Linux

```

## Graphical User Interface

There is a simple Graphical User Interface for the NiaAML package available [here](https://github.com/lukapecnik/NiaAML-GUI).

## API

There is a simple API for remote work with NiaAML package available [here](https://github.com/alenrajsp/NiaAML-API).

## Components

[Click here](COMPONENTS.md) for a list of currently implemented components divided into groups: classifiers, feature selection algorithms and feature transformation algorithms. At the end you can also see a list of currently implemented fitness functions for the optimization process, categorical features' encoders, and missing values' imputers. All of the components are passed into the optimization process using their class names. Let's say we want to choose between Adaptive Boosting, Bagging and Multi Layer Perceptron classifiers, Select K Best and Select Percentile feature selection algorithms and Normalizer as the feature transformation algorithm (may not be selected during the optimization process).

```python
PipelineOptimizer(
    data=...,
    classifiers=['AdaBoost', 'Bagging', 'MultiLayerPerceptron'],
    feature_selection_algorithms=['SelectKBest', 'SelectPercentile'],
    feature_transform_algorithms=['Normalizer']
)
```

The argument of the PipelineOptimizer `categorical_features_encoder` is `None` by default. If your dataset contains any categorical features, you need to specify an encoder to use. The same goes for `imputer` and features that contain missing values.

```python
PipelineOptimizer(
    data=...,
    classifiers=['AdaBoost', 'Bagging', 'MultiLayerPerceptron'],
    feature_selection_algorithms=['SelectKBest', 'SelectPercentile'],
    feature_transform_algorithms=['Normalizer'],
    categorical_features_encoder='OneHotEncoder',
    imputer='SimpleImputer'
)
```

For a full example see the [Examples section](#examples) or the list of implemented examples [here](examples).

## Optimization Process And Parameter Tuning

In the modifier version of NiaAML optimization process there are two types of optimization. The goal of the first type is to find an optimal set of components (feature selection algorithm, feature transformation algorithm and classifier). The next step is to find optimal parameters for the selected set of components, and that is the goal of the second type of optimization. Each component has an attribute `_params`, which is a dictionary of parameters and their possible values.

```python
self._params = dict(
    n_estimators = ParameterDefinition(MinMax(min=10, max=111), np.uint),
    algorithm = ParameterDefinition(['SAMME', 'SAMME.R'])
)
```

An individual in the first type of optimization is represented as a real-valued vector that has a size equal to the sum of the number of keys in all three dictionaries (classifier's _params, Feature Transformation algorithm's _params and feature selection algorithm's _params) and the value of each dimension is in the range [0.0, 1.0]. The second type of optimization maps real values from the individual's vector to those parameter definitions in the dictionaries. Each parameter's value can be defined as a range or array of values. In the first case, a value from a vector is mapped from one iterval to another, and in the second case, a value from the vector falls into one of the bins that represent an index of the array that holds possible parameters` values.

Let's say we have a classifier with 3 parameters, a feature selection algorithm with 2 parameters and feature transformation algorithm with 4 parameters. The size of an individual in the second type of optimization is 9. The size of an individual in the first type of optimization is always 3 (1 classifier, 1 feature selection algorithm and 1 feature transformation algorithm).

In some cases we may want to tune a parameter that needs additional information for setting its range of values, so we cannot set the range in the initialization method. In that case, we should set its value in the dictionary to None and define it later in the process. The parameter will be a part of the parameter tuning process as soon as we define its possible values. For example, see [Select K Best Feature Selection](niaaml/preprocessing/feature_selection/select_k_best.py) and its parameter `k`.

**The NiaAML framwork also supports running optimization according to the original method proposed in [[1]](#1) where the components selection and hyperparameter optimization steps are combined into one.**

## Examples

### Example of Usage

Load data and try to find the optimal pipeline for the given components. The example below uses the Particle Swarm Algorithm as the optimization algorithm. You can find a list of all available algorithms in the <a href="https://github.com/NiaOrg/NiaPy">NiaPy's repository</a>.

```python
from niaaml import PipelineOptimizer, Pipeline
from niaaml.data import BasicDataReader
import numpy
import pandas

# dummy random data
data_reader = BasicDataReader(
    x=numpy.random.uniform(low=0.0, high=15.0, size=(50, 3)),
    y=numpy.random.choice(['Class 1', 'Class 2'], size=50)
)

pipeline_optimizer = PipelineOptimizer(
    data=data_reader,
    classifiers=['AdaBoost', 'Bagging', 'MultiLayerPerceptron', 'RandomForest', 'ExtremelyRandomizedTrees', 'LinearSVC'],
    feature_selection_algorithms=['SelectKBest', 'SelectPercentile', 'ParticleSwarmOptimization', 'VarianceThreshold'],
    feature_transform_algorithms=['Normalizer', 'StandardScaler']
)

# run the modified version of optimization
pipeline1 = pipeline_optimizer.run('Accuracy', 15, 15, 300, 300, 'ParticleSwarmAlgorithm', 'ParticleSwarmAlgorithm')

# run the original version
pipeline2 = pipeline_optimizer.run_v1('Accuracy', 15, 400, 'ParticleSwarmAlgorithm')
```

You can save a result of the optimization process as an object to a file for later use.

```python
pipeline1.export('pipeline.ppln')
```

And also load it from a file and use the pipeline.

```python
loaded_pipeline = Pipeline.load('pipeline.ppln')

# some features (can be loaded using DataReader object instances)
x = pandas.DataFrame([[0.35, 0.46, 5.32], [0.16, 0.55, 12.5]])
y = loaded_pipeline.run(x)
```

You can also save a user-friendly representation of a pipeline to a text file.

```python
pipeline1.export_text('pipeline.txt')
```

This is a very simple example with dummy data. It is only intended to give you a basic idea of how to use the framework.

### Example of a Pipeline Component's Implementation

The NiaAML framework is easily expandable, as you can implement components by overriding the base classes' methods. To implement a classifier you should inherit from the [Classifier](niaaml/classifiers/classifier.py) class, and you can do the same with [FeatureSelectionAlgorithm](niaaml/preprocessing/feature_selection/feature_selection_algorithm.py) and [FeatureTransformAlgorithm](niaaml/preprocessing/feature_transform/feature_transform_algorithm.py) classes. All of the mentioned classes inherit from the [PipelineComponent](niaaml/pipeline_component.py) class.

Take a look at the [Classifier](niaaml/classifiers/classifier.py) class and the implementation of the [AdaBoost](niaaml/classifiers/ada_boost.py) classifier that inherits from it.

### Example of a Fitness Function's Implementation

The NiaAML framework also allows you to implement your own fitness function. All you need to do is implement the [FitnessFunction](niaaml/fitness/fitness_function.py) class.

Take a look at the [Accuracy](niaaml/fitness/accuracy.py) implementation.

### Example of a Feature Encoder's Implementation

The NiaAML framework also allows you to implement your own feature encoder. All you need to do is implement the [FeatureEncoder](niaaml/preprocessing/encoding/feature_encoder.py) class.

Take a look at the [OneHotEncoder](niaaml/preprocessing/encoding/one_hot_encoder.py) implementation.

### Example of an Imputer's Implementation

The NiaAML framework also allows you to implement your own imputer. All you need to do is implement the [Imputer](niaaml/preprocessing/imputation/imputer.py) class.

Take a look at the [SimpleImputer](niaaml/preprocessing/imputation/simple_imputer.py) implementation.

# Summary

The field of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has been developed to automate data preprocessing and search for optimal algorithms together with their hyperparameters in order to discover the best possible ML pipeline for an input dataset [@bookHutter]. AutoML can be modeled as a continuous optimization problem with several potential optimization methods considered. Stochastic population-based nature-inspired algorithms [@yang2014; @engelbrecht2007computational] are a popular class of tools for dealing with such continuous optimization problems. These algorithms are inspired mainly by the biological behavior of various species living in nature [@fister2013brief]. Such algorithms are composed of a population of individuals that undergo different variation operations during the evolution process which results in new populations. The Python framework we have developed, NiaAML, incorporates these stochastic algorithms to search for the most suitable classification pipeline in a dataset [@Fister2020Continuous].

The framework is developed in a layer style layout architecture consisting of several components, including feature selection algorithms, feature transformation algorithms and classifiers. Its task is to find a perfect combination of components with proper classifier hyperparameter settings to build an efficient, yet customizable classification pipeline with the help of a popular collection of nature-inspired algorithms, named NiaPy [@Vrbančič2018]. NiaAML incorporates two types of optimizations, the first involves finding the optimal set of components for the pipeline, and the second involves tuning the hyperparameters. Users can freely choose the ML components to be included into the optimization process, as well as select suitable fitness functions to be used for evaluation of candidate pipelines. Input data can be in the form of numerical and categorical features, as well as missing attributes, while pipelines are exported and imported as binary files for post-hoc use. Further, they can be exported as user-friendly text files that contain all of the relevant information about the pipeline and its components. A graphical outline of the NiaAML method is presented in \autoref{fig:NiaAMLflow}.

# Statement of need

Searching for an optimal classification pipeline in ML that provides the best results for a particular classification task involves a lot of domain-specific knowledge and numerous trial-and-error approaches. For instance, several conditions must be fulfilled to adequately apply an ML algorithm, such as proper preparation and preprocessing of input data, and selection of appropriate classifiers as well as their parameters. Due to this, mostly ML experts and data scientists have been able to handle such tasks in the past. However, empirical evidence shows that automation of the optimal classifier selection process, feature preprocessing steps and their hyperparameters, can be dealt with by non-experts as well [@NIPS2015_11d0e628; @7280767].

With the rise of AutoML methods, dealing with ML has also become available to researchers from other fields. Compared to similar Python AutoML frameworks, such as TPOT [@tpot] and auto-sklearn [@NIPS2015_11d0e628], NiaAML offers the following benefits:

1. It is fully modeled as a continuous optimization problem, which means that arbitrary stochastic nature-inspired population-based algorithms can be used for solving this task without any special modifications of their internal mechanisms.

2. The search for the optimal combination of ML components and proper classifier hyperparameters can be conducted concurrently.

3. Its layer style architecture allows the straightforward addition of new ML components.

4. Every pipeline in the output is feasible and functional in cases of the correct specified hyperparameters domains.

5. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) further simplifies the work for users without expert domain knowledge.

NiaAML is an automated machine learning Python framework based on
nature-inspired algorithms for optimization. The name comes from the
automated machine learning method of the same name [1]. Its
goal is to efficiently compose the best possible classification pipeline
for the given task using components on the input. The components are
divided into three groups: feature seletion algorithms, feature
transformation algorithms and classifiers. The framework uses
nature-inspired algorithms for optimization to choose the best set of
components for the classification pipeline on the output and optimize
their parameters. We use `NiaPy framework <https://github.com/NiaOrg/NiaPy>`_ for the optimization process
which is a popular Python collection of nature-inspired algorithms. The
NiaAML framework is easy to use and customize or expand to suit your
needs.

The NiaAML framework allows you not only to run full pipeline optimization, but also separate implemented components such as classifiers, feature selection algorithms, etc. **It supports numerical and categorical features as well as missing values in datasets.**

===============

This section is going to show you how to use the NiaAML framework. First install NiaAML package using the following command:

.. code:: bash

    pip3 install niaaml

After the successful installation you are ready to run your first example.

Basic example
-------------
Create a new file, with name, for example *my_first_pipeline.py* and paste in the code below.

.. code:: python

    from niaaml import PipelineOptimizer, Pipeline
    from niaaml.data import BasicDataReader
    import numpy

    # dummy random data
    data_reader = BasicDataReader(
        x=numpy.random.uniform(low=0.0, high=15.0, size=(50, 3)),
        y=numpy.random.choice(['Class 1', 'Class 2'], size=50)
    )

    pipeline_optimizer = PipelineOptimizer(
        data=data_reader,
        classifiers=['AdaBoost', 'Bagging', 'MultiLayerPerceptron', 'RandomForest', 'ExtremelyRandomizedTrees', 'LinearSVC'],
        feature_selection_algorithms=['SelectKBest', 'SelectPercentile', 'ParticleSwarmOptimization', 'VarianceThreshold'],
        feature_transform_algorithms=['Normalizer', 'StandardScaler']
    )
    pipeline = pipeline_optimizer.run('Accuracy', 15, 15, 300, 300, 'ParticleSwarmAlgorithm', 'ParticleSwarmAlgorithm')

**As you can see, pipeline components, fitness function and optimization algorithms are always passed into pipeline optimization using their class names.** The example below uses the Particle Swarm Algorithm as the optimization algorithm. You can find a list of all available algorithms in the `NiaPy's documentation <https://niapy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.
Now you can run it using the command ``python3 my_first_pipeline.py``. The code currently does not do much, but we can save our pipeline to a file so we can use it later or save a user-friendly representation of it to a text file. You can choose one or both of the scenarios by adding the code below.

.. code:: python

    pipeline.export('pipeline.ppln')
    pipeline.export_text('pipeline.txt')

If you want to load and use the saved pipeline later, you can use the following code.

.. code:: python
    
    from niaaml import Pipeline
    import pandas

    loaded_pipeline = Pipeline.load('pipeline.ppln')

    # some features (can be loaded using DataReader object instances)
    x = pandas.DataFrame([[0.35, 0.46, 5.32], [0.16, 0.55, 12.5]])
    y = loaded_pipeline.run(x)

**The framework also supports the original version of optimization process where the components selection and hyperparameter optimization steps are combined into one. You can replace the ``run`` method with the following code.**

.. code:: python
    
    pipeline = pipeline_optimizer.run_v1('Accuracy', 15, 400, 'ParticleSwarmAlgorithm')

This is a very simple example with dummy data. It is only intended to give you a basic idea on how to use the framework. **NiaAML supports numerical and categorical features.**

Optimization Process And Parameter Tuning
-----------------------------------------

In NiaAML there are two types of optimization. Goal of the first type is to find an optimal set of components (feature selection algorithm, feature transformation algorithm and classifier). The next step is to find optimal parameters for the selected set of components and that is a goal of the second type of optimization. Each component has an attribute **_params**, which is a dictionary of parameters and their possible values.

.. code:: python

    self._params = dict(
        n_estimators = ParameterDefinition(MinMax(min=10, max=111), np.uint),
        algorithm = ParameterDefinition(['SAMME', 'SAMME.R'])
    )

An individual in the second type of optimization is a real-valued vector that has a size equal to the sum of number of keys in all three dictionaries (classifier's _params, feature transformation algorithm's _params and feature selection algorithm's _params) and a value of each dimension is in range [0.0, 1.0]. The second type of optimization maps real values from the individual's vector to those parameter definitions in the dictionaries. Each parameter's value can be defined as a range or array of values. In the first case, a value from vector is mapped from one iterval to another and in the second case, a value from vector falls into one of the bins that represent an index of the array that holds possible parameter's values.

Let's say we have a classifier with 3 parameters, feature selection algorithm with 2 parameters and feature transformation algorithm with 4 parameters. Size of an individual in the second type of optimization is 9. Size of an individual in the first type of optimization is always 3 (1 classifier, 1 feature selection algorithm and 1 feature transform algorithm).

In some cases we may want to tune a parameter that needs additional information for setting its range of values, so we cannot set the range in the initialization method. In that case we should set its value in the dictionary to None and define it later in the process. The parameter will be a part of parameter tuning process as soon as we define its possible values. For example, see the implementation of :class:`niaaml.preprocessing.feature_selection.SelectKBest` and its parameter **k**.NiaAML's documentation!
==================================

.. automodule:: niaaml

NiaAML is an automated machine learning Python framework based on nature-inspired algorithms for optimization. The name comes from the automated machine learning method of the same name [1]. Its goal is to efficiently compose the best possible classification pipeline for the given task using components on the input. The components are divided into three groups: feature seletion algorithms, feature transformation algorithms and classifiers. The framework uses nature-inspired algorithms for optimization to choose the best set of components for the classification pipeline on the output and optimize their parameters. We use `NiaPy framework <https://github.com/NiaOrg/NiaPy>`_  for the optimization process which is a popular Python collection of nature-inspired algorithms. The NiaAML framework is easy to use and customize or expand to suit your needs.

=====

NiaAML is an automated machine learning Python framework based on nature-inspired algorithms for optimization. The name comes from the `automated machine learning method of the same name <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-981-15-2133-1_13>`_. Its goal is to efficiently compose the best possible classification pipeline for the given task using components on the input. The components are divided into three groups: feature seletion algorithms, feature transformation algorithms and classifiers. The framework uses nature-inspired algorithms for optimization to choose the best set of components for the classification pipeline on the output and optimize their parameters. We use NiaPy framework for the optimization process which is a popular Python collection of nature-inspired algorithms. The NiaAML framework is easy to use and customize or expand to suit your needs.

The NiaAML framework allows you not only to run full pipeline optimization, but also separate implemented components such as classifiers, feature selection algorithms, etc. It supports numerical and categorical features.

Testing
=======

Before making a pull request, if possible provide tests for added features or bug fixes.

We have an automated building system which also runs all of provided tests. In case any of the test cases fails, we are notified about failing tests. Those should be fixed before we merge your pull request to master branch.

For the purpose of checking if all test are passing localy you can run following command:

.. code:: sh

    $ poetry run coverage run --source=niaaml -m unittest discover -b

If all tests passed running this command it is most likely that the tests would pass on our build system too.Changelog
