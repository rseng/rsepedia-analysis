## Introduction

Ripserer is a pure Julia implementation of the [Ripser](https://github.com/Ripser/ripser)
algorithm for computing persistent homology. Its aims are to be easy to use, generic, and
fast.

See the [documentation](https://mtsch.github.io/Ripserer.jl/dev) for more information and
usage examples.

If you're looking for persistence diagram-related functionality such as Wasserstein or
bottleneck distances, persistence images, or persistence curves, please see
[PersistenceDiagrams.jl](https://github.com/mtsch/PersistenceDiagrams.jl).

## Quick start

This package is registered. To install it, run the following.

```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("Ripserer")
```

Now, generate some data.

```julia
julia> data = [(rand(), rand(), rand()) for _ in 1:200]
```

The main exported function in this package is
[`ripserer`](https://mtsch.github.io/Ripserer.jl/dev/api/ripserer/#Ripserer.ripserer). By
default, it computes Vietoris-Rips persistent homology on point cloud data and distance
matrices.

```julia
julia> ripserer(data)
# 2-element Vector{PersistenceDiagramsBase.PersistenceDiagram}:
#  200-element 0-dimensional PersistenceDiagram
#  84-element 1-dimensional PersistenceDiagram
```

[Several other filtration
types](https://mtsch.github.io/Ripserer.jl/dev/api/ripserer/#Filtrations) are supported. We
tell `ripserer` to use them by passing them as the first argument.

```julia
julia> ripserer(EdgeCollapsedRips, data)
# 2-element Vector{PersistenceDiagramsBase.PersistenceDiagram}:
#  200-element 0-dimensional PersistenceDiagram
#  84-element 1-dimensional PersistenceDiagram
```

Sometimes you may want to initialize a filtration in advance.

```julia
julia> rips = EdgeCollapsedRips(data, threshold=1)
# EdgeCollapsedRips{Int64, Float64}(nv=200)
```
```julia
julia> ripserer(rips, dim_max=2)
# 3-element Vector{PersistenceDiagramsBase.PersistenceDiagram}:
#  200-element 0-dimensional PersistenceDiagram
#  84-element 1-dimensional PersistenceDiagram
#  16-element 2-dimensional PersistenceDiagram
```

Ripserer supports plotting with
[Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl). Experimental
[Makie.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl) support is also available
[here](https://github.com/mtsch/MakieRipserer.jl).

Plotting persistence diagrams and barcodes is straightforward:

```julia
using Plots
result = ripserer(data, dim_max=2)
plot(plot(result), barcode(result)
```
![](docs/src/assets/readme-plot-1.svg)

```julia
barcode(result)
```
![](docs/src/assets/readme-plot-2.svg)

# Introduction

Persistent homology [@edelsbrunner2008persistent] is a relatively recent computational
technique that extracts topological information from various kinds of datasets. This
topological information gives us a good overview of the global shape of the data as well as
giving us a description of its local geometry. Since its introduction, it has been used in a
diverse range of applications, including biology [@bernoff2016biological], material science
[@lee2017quantifying], signal processing [@tralie2016high], and computer vision
[@asaad2017topological]. A problem persistent homology faces is the very large size of
combinatorial structures it has to work with. Recent algorithmic advances employ various
computational shortcuts to overcome this problem.

Among the most successful implementations of persistent homology is Ripser
[@bauer2019ripser]. With its speed and low memory usage, it makes persistent homology
practical for larger datasets, even in higher dimensions. The introduction of Ripser has
spawned a whole cottage industry of extensions and wrappers. Some examples include Ripser++
[@zhang2020gpu], Lock-free Ripser [@morozov2020towards], Ripser.py [@tralie2018ripser],
Cubical Ripser [@kaji2020cubical], and Flagser [@lutgehetmann2020computing].

In the Julia [@bezanson2017julia] space, there are few persistent homology packages
available. The ones we were able to find include Eirene.jl[^1] [@henselman2016matroid],
ComputationalHomology.jl[^2], Sparips.jl[^3] [@brehm2018sparips], and
PersistentCohomology.jl[^4], of which only Eirene.jl is available through the Julia package
manager.

# Statement of Need

A significant hurdle in developing new approaches to persistent homology stems from the fact
that developing an efficient implementation of its matrix reduction algorithm is nontrivial.

To solve this problem, we introduce Ripserer.jl, a pure Julia implementation of persistent
homology based on the algorithm that powers Ripser. It provides users with an intuitive
user interface and is readily useful as a topological data analysis framework. The other
main feature Ripserer.jl provides is the ability to hook into its algorithm through an
API. This allows researchers to experiment with different approaches to persistent homology
without having to reimplement the algorithm from scratch or forking an existing repository.

![Example visualizations. The plot on the left shows the three main representative cocycles
in the data. The right plot shows the persistence diagram.](figure.png)

# Summary

Along with its companion package, PersistenceDiagrams.jl[^5], Ripserer.jl provides a
featureful environment for computing persistent homology and integrating it with the rest of
Julia's data science stack. At the time of writing, it offers the following features.

* Fast Vietoris-Rips, alpha complex, and cubical persistent homology computation.
* Representative cocycle and critical simplex computation.
* Support for coefficients in any, possibly user-defined, field.
* Convenient persistence diagram and representative cocycle visualization via Plots.jl[^6]
  recipes.
* Bottleneck and Wasserstein matching and distance computation.
* Various persistence diagram vectorization functions, implemented with persistence
  images [@adams2017persistence] and persistence curves [@chung2019persistence].
* Easy extensibility through a documented API.

Our benchmarks[^7] show that Ripserer's performance is very close to that of Ripser. It
tends to be slightly slower for dense inputs and slightly faster for very sparse inputs. In
the cubical case, we compared it to Cubical Ripser. There the performance was worse, taking
up to 3 times as long to compute some results. This is expected as Cubical Ripser is much
more specialized for its use case and even splits its code into different repositories for
different dimensions.

We have not compared performance with newer, parallel implementations such as Ripser++ or
lock-free Ripser. Judging from the benchmarks they provide, we expect them to perform much
better. Their downside, however, is that they require powerful hardware, such as GPUs or
large numbers of processors.

Author: Matija ÄŒufar ([@mtsch](https://github.com/mtsch/))

## Introduction

Ripserer is a pure Julia library for computing persistent homology based on the
[Ripser](https://github.com/Ripser/ripser) algorithm. Roughly speaking, persistent homology
detects the global topological and local geometric structure of data in a noise-resistant,
stable way. If you are unfamiliar with persistent homology, I recommend reading this
[excellent
introduction](https://towardsdatascience.com/persistent-homology-with-examples-1974d4b9c3d0).

Please see the [Usage Guide](@ref) for a quick introduction, and the [API](@ref) page for
detailed descriptions of Ripserer's functionality.

While this package is fully functional, it is still in development and should not be
considered stable. I try to disrupt the public interface as little as possible, but breaking
changes might still occur from time to time.

## Installation

This package is registered. To install it, simply run the following and everything should
just work.

```julia
julia> import Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("Ripserer")
```

All versions of Julia from 1.0 onward are supported, but I recommend using the latest
version of Julia for optimal performance.

## Features

Ripserer and its companion package
[PersistenceDiagrams.jl](https://github.com/mtsch/PersistenceDiagrams.jl) currently support

* Fast Vietoris-Rips and cubical, and alpha complex persistent homology computation.
* Representative cocycle, cycle, and critical simplex computation.
* Convenient persistence diagram and representative cocycle visualization via
  [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl). Experimental
  [Makie.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl) is also available
  [here](https://github.com/mtsch/MakieRipserer.jl).
* Bottleneck and Wasserstein matching and distance computation.
* Various persistence diagram vectorization functions, implemented with persistence images
  and persistence curves.
* Easy extensibility through a documented API.
* Integration with [MLJ.jl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl).
* Experimental shortest representative cycle computation.
* Experimental sparse circular coordinate computation.

To access some of the features, you need to use the PersistenceDiagrams.jl package.

## Performance

Much like Ripser, Ripserer uses several computational tricks to achieve its speed. Among
others, these include an implicit simplicial complex representation and the clearing
optimization. For a more detailed overview of these optimizations, check out [Ulrich Bauer's
article on Ripser](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02518).

In general, the performance of Ripserer is very close to
[Ripser](https://github.com/Ripser/ripser), usually within around 30%. Ripserer's strength
performance-wise is very sparse inputs, where it can sometimes outperform Ripser. It also
computes some things Ripser skips, like the critical simplices.

Ripserer's Cubical homology is up to 3Ã— slower than that of [Cubical
Ripser](https://github.com/CubicalRipser/), which uses a more specialized
algorithm. Ripserer is still a good choice for small 3d images and large 2d images. Unlike
Cubical Ripser, it also supports computations on images of dimensions higher than 4.

See the [Benchmarks](@ref) section for more detailed benchmarks.

## Extending

Ripserer is designed to be easily extended with new simplex or filtration types. See the
[Abstract Types and Interfaces](@ref) API section for more information.

If you have written an extension or are having trouble implementing one, please feel free to
open a pull request or an issue. You may also contact me directly.

# Benchmarks

The following tables show benchmarks that compare Ripserer's performance with
[Ripser](https://github.com/Ripser/ripser), [Cubical
Ripser](https://github.com/CubicalRipser/), and
[Eirene.jl](https://github.com/Eetion/Eirene.jl). The benchmarking code and more info about
the datasets are available [here](https://github.com/mtsch/RipsererBenchmarks.jl).

All benchmarks were performed on a laptop with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4200U CPU @ 1.60GHz
with 8GB of RAM.

We used [BenchmarkTools.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl/) to perform the
timing benchmarks and [Valgrind's Massif
tool](https://www.valgrind.org/docs/manual/ms-manual.html) to measure peak heap sizes
(i.e. total memory footprint).

The benchmarks were performed with Ripserer v0.15, `master` versions of Ripser (commit
hash `286d369`) and Cubical Ripser (commit hashes `6edb9c5` for 2D and `a063dac` for 3D),
and Eirene v1.3.5.

The timings show the minimum time taken among five runs of the benchmark.

The heap sizes for Ripserer include the Julia runtime.

## Comparison with Ripser

In this experiment, we performed benchmarks with the datasets presented in the [Ripser
article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02518). We only used the datasets that we were able to
run with less than 8GB memory. All datasets were parsed as `Float32` as that is what Ripser
supports. The time it takes to parse a file is included for both Ripser and Ripserer.

In these benchmarks, we used some of the datasets presented in the [Cubical
Ripser](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12692) article. We limited the 2D image size to 1999Ã—999
as the current `master` (commit hash `6edb9c5`) version of 2D Cubical Ripser throws an
assertion error for anything larger. We were also unable to perform 3D 256Ã—256Ã—256 image
benchmarks due to Ripserer running out of memory. The `eltype` of all datasets is `Float64`,
because that is what Cubical Ripser supports. When running Ripserer in the real world, it's
a good idea to use the image's native data types. This will _slightly_ reduce the memory
footprint and increase performance.

## Comparison with Eirene

In these benchmarks, we compare Ripserer to
[Eirene.jl](https://github.com/Eetion/Eirene.jl). Ripserer benchmarks were run with
`alg=:involuted`, so this measures the time it takes to compute representative cycles.

|dataset     |size|dim|threshold|Ripserer  |Eirene  |ratio|

# Related Julia Packages

This section attempts to provide an overview of Julia packages implementing persistent
homology. If you're trying to do something Ripserer is missing, one of these might have what
you're looking for.

This list is incomplete and only includes things I'm aware of. The descriptions are based
on my (limited) experience with these packages.

* [ComputationalHomology.jl](https://github.com/wildart/ComputationalHomology.jl) uses a
  different, slower algorithm, but can do some things Ripserer can't such as ÄŒech
  persistent homology and homology of CW complexes. The package is a part of
  [TDA.jl](https://github.com/wildart/TDA.jl), which also offers other topological data
  analysis tools like Mapper.

* [Eirene.jl](https://github.com/Eetion/Eirene.jl) uses a [different algorithm based on
  matroids](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00199). A benefit of this algorithm is that it can
  recover persistent homology generators and a bunch of other data.

* [Ripser.jl](https://github.com/mtsch/Ripser.jl) my deprecated wrapper of the original
  C++ program. Very bare-bones and outdated. Runs a bit slower than Ripserer.

* [Sparips.jl](https://github.com/mtsch/Ripser.jl) this is a preprocessor that comes with
  a different wrapper of Ripser. The preprocessor allows you to compute persistent homology
  of very large datasets. Integrating it with Ripserer is on my TODO list.

* [PersistentCohomology.jl](https://github.com/piever/PersistentCohomology.jl) does
  essentially the same thing, but with a different algorithm, that is orders of magnitude
  slower.

If you are a developer of a persistent homology package not on this list, or any of the
information here is incorrect, let me know or open a PR.
