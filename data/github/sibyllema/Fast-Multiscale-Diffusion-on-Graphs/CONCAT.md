# Code for reproducible research - Fast Multiscale Diffusion on Graphs
Code to reproduce experiments in "Fast Multiscale Diffusion on Graphs" (Sibylle Marcotte, Amélie Barbe, Rémi Gribonval, Titouan Vayer, Marc Sebban, Pierre Borgnat, Paulo Gonçalves). Article is available at: https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03212764/. In the interest of reproducible research, this is exactly the version of the code used to generate the figures in the article, which has also been archived at: https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03576498.


## Requirements
The code is written in Python3, and uses the following libraries: NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib and ogb.

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the dependencies.

## Execution
