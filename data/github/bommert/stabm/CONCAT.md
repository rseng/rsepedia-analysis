## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

# Summary
The R [@R] package *stabm* provides functionality for quantifying the similarity of two or more sets.
For example, consider the two sets $\{A, B, C, D\}$ and $\{A, B, C, E\}$.
Intuitively, these sets are quite similar because their overlap is large compared to the cardinality of the two sets.
The R package *stabm* implements functions to express the similarity of sets by a real valued score.
Quantifying the similarity of sets is useful for comparing sets of selected features.
But also for many other tasks like similarity analyses of gene sets or text corpora, the R package *stabm* can be employed.

In the context of feature selection, the similarity of sets of selected features is assessed in order to determine the stability of a feature selection algorithm.
The stability of a feature selection algorithm is defined as the robustness of the set of selected features towards different data sets from the same data generating distribution [@kalousis2007stability].
For stability assessment, either *m* data sets from the same data generating process are available or *m* data sets are created from one data set.
The latter is often achieved with subsampling or random perturbations [@awada2012review].
Then, the feature selection algorithm of interest is applied to each of the *m* data sets, resulting in *m* feature sets.
To quantify the stability of the feature selection algorithm, the similarity of the *m* sets is calculated.
In the context of feature selection stability, set similarity measures are called stability measures.

The R package *stabm* provides an open-source implementation of the 20 stability measures displayed in the table below.
Argument checks are performed with checkmate [@lang2017checkmate] to provide helpful error messages.
It is publicly available on CRAN and on Github and it has only a few dependencies.

# Statement of Need
The R package *stabm* provides an implementation of many stability measures.
For theoretical and empirical comparative studies of the stability measures implemented in *stabm*, we refer to @bommert2017multicriteria, @bommert2020adjusted, @bommert2020integration, and @nogueira2018stability.
It has been demonstrated that considering the feature selection stability when fitting a predictive model often is beneficial for obtaining models with high predictive accuracy [@bommert2017multicriteria; @bommert2020integration; @schirra2016selection].
The stability measures implemented in the R package *stabm* have been employed in @bommert2017multicriteria, @bommert2020benchmark, @bommert2020adjusted, and @bommert2020integration.

# Related Software
A subset of the implemented stability measures is also available in other R or Python packages.
The R package *sets* [@meyer2009sets] and the Python package *scikit-learn* [@pedregosa2011scikit] provide an implementation of the Jaccard index [@jaccard1901etude] to assess the similarity of two sets.
The Python package *GSimPy* [@zhang2020gsimpy] implements the Jaccard index, the Dice index [@dice1945measures], and the Ochiai index [@ochiai1957zoogeographic].
The source code for the publication @nogueira2018stability provides an implementation of their stability measure in R, Python, and Matlab.
