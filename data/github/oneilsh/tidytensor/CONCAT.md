# Summary

Deep learning applications commonly employ the use of *tensors* (multidimensional arrays) for data storage and manipulation. In addition to being space efficient tensors provide a common framework for, the engine of deep neural network training [@baydin2018automatic]. TidyTensor is an R package for inspecting and manipulating tensors. It provides an improved `print()` function for summarizing structure, named tensors, conversion to data frames, and high-level manipulation functions. Designed to complement `keras` package (or other packages that utilize native R arrays), functionality is layered on top of base R types.


# Statement of need

While R supports multidimensional arrays natively, there are important differences between these types and tensors as typically used in deep learning applications. First, R assumes array data are organized in a column-major order as opposed to the row-major order typically used in Python, rendering the default `print()` and other inspection methods far less useful. TidyTensor additionally provides support for "named" tensors, allowing researchers to use semantically-relevant names for working with and manipulating tensors via a familiar tidy-friendly interface. While other packages exist for named arrays in R, TidyTensor leverages a hierarchical interpretation of tensor data that makes it easy to manipulate and investigate tensor data of various kinds. Early versions of TidyTensor supported a 3-week researcher-oriented workshop "Deep Learning for Life Scientists" at Oregon State University's Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing, and these features supported graduate students and faculty new to the field in applying deep learning techniques to datasets from their own work.


# Related Work

Other packages implement named tensors, though without the "tidy" features of TidyTensor or the simplification of asserting nesting/set-of-sets semantics. In Python, the [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) package provides named tensors and a wide variety of manipulation and related features [@hoyer2017xarray], while in R the [garray](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/garray/garray.pdf) package provides features similar to TidyTensor [@garray], including implementing names in the same way allowing for easy conversion to and from TidyTensors. The [stars](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/) R package also provides named arrays with a focus on spatiotemporal data [@stars]. TidyTensor utilizes [abind](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/abind/index.html) internally for array manipulation [@abind].

TidyTensor was designed primarily as a companion to the [keras](https://keras.rstudio.com/) and [tensorflow](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/) ports for R which utilize native R types [@rkeras; @rtensorflow]. By contrast, the recently released [torch](https://torch.mlverse.org/) port for R does not use native R types for tensors [@rtorch]; using TidyTensor with this package would require costly conversion to-and-from Torch-native types.

TidyTensor is an R package for inspecting and manipulating tensors (multidimensional arrays). It provides an improved `print()` for summarizing structure, named tensors, conversion to data frames, and high-level manipulation functions. Designed to complement the  `keras` package for deep learning in R, functionality is layered on top of base R types.

TidyTensor was inspired by a workshop I taught in deep learning with R, and a desire to explain and explore tensors in a more intuitive way.

## Installation

A simple `devtools::install_github("oneilsh/tidytensor")` will do it. If you don't have `devtools`, first grab it with `install.packages("devtools")`.

If you use TidyTensor, let us know in an [issue](https://github.com/oneilsh/tidytensor/issues/new)!

## Examples and Usage

Here we provide just two basic examples of how TidyTensor can help illuminate data used for deep learning. See the [Getting Started](https://oneilsh.github.io/tidytensor/articles/tidytensor.html) vignette for more examples of visualizing tensor structure, filtering and data augmentation, producing train/test splits, and other handy features.


Consider the `CIFAR10` dataset distributed with the `keras` library:

```
## library(keras)
cifar10_raw <- dataset_cifar10()$train$x 
```

TidyTensor can be used to plot the contained image data with the help of other `tidyverse` packages:

```
## library(tidytensor)
## library(ggplot2)
## library(tidyr)

cifar10_raw %>%
  as.tidytensor() %>%
  set_ranknames(image, row, col, channel) %>%
  set_dimnames_for_rank(channel, R, G, B) %>%
  subset(image = 1:4) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  spread(channel, value) %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_tile(aes(x = col, y = row, fill = rgb(R, G, B, maxColorValue = 255))) +
    facet_wrap( ~ image) +
    coord_equal() +
    scale_y_reverse() +
    scale_fill_identity()
```

<img src="man/figures/cifar_color.png" style="width: 60%; align: left" />

For a second example, we can start with a `keras` model and generate a function mapping inputs to internal feature map representations:

```
vgg_model <- application_vgg16(include_top = FALSE, input_shape = c(32, 32, 3))

input <- vgg_model$input
output <- get_layer(vgg_model, name = "block1_conv2")$output

# input shape (N, 32, 32, 3)
# output shape (N, 32, 32, 64) tensor, where last rank are feature maps
compute_featuremaps <- k_function(input, output)
```

TidyTensor can then be used to feed a given set of input tensors through the function and visualize the resulting convolutional feature maps:

```
(cifar10_raw / 255) %>%
  as.tidytensor() %>%
  set_ranknames(image, row, col, channel) %>%
  set_dimnames_for_rank(channel, R, G, B) %>%
  subset(image = 1:4) %>%
  compute_featuremaps() %>% 
  as.tidytensor() %>%
  set_ranknames(image, row, col, featuremap) %>%
  subset(featuremap = 1:6) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_tile(aes(x = col, y = row, fill = value)) +
    facet_grid(image ~ featuremap) +
    coord_equal() +
    scale_y_reverse() 
```

## Specific Needs

Although TidyTensor's `print()` function is the original *raison d'Ãªtre* for the package, there is still a lot of room for improvement (up to and including a full reimplementation). We also welcome additional suggestions for inspecting, browsing, or visualizing the structure and content of large tensors, for example via plots or interactive Shiny dashboards. 

Assigning values to TidyTensors is possible (with e.g. `t[, , , "R"] <- 0` to zero out the red channel in a channels-last image tensor), but the implementation is significantly slower than for base-R arrays where `[<-` is dispatched to a primitive function. Improvements or suggestions here are welcome.

Aside from these improvements to base functionality, additional functions for 'tensorifying' common data types would be beneficial. For example, early versions of TidyTensor included functionality to produce tensor-encoded versions of [fasta files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) commonly used in bioinformations applications--remnants of these efforts can be found in the source. Because these require dependencies (on e.g. `Rsamtools` and `GenomicRanges`) and are field-specific, these may be better placed in a separate package with a dependency on TidyTensor.
