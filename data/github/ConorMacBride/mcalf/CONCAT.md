# Summary

Determining accurate velocity measurements from observations of the Sun is of vital importance to solar physicists who are studying the wave dynamics in the solar atmosphere. Weak chromospheric absorption lines, due to dynamic events in the solar atmosphere, often consist of multiple spectral components. Isolating these components allows for the velocity field of the dynamic and quiescent regimes to be studied independently. However, isolating such components is particularly challenging due to the wide variety of spectral shapes present in the same dataset. `MCALF` provides a novel method and infrastructure to determine Doppler velocities in a large dataset. Each spectrum is fitted with a model adapted to its specific spectral shape.

# Statement of need

MCALF is an open-source Python package for accurately constraining velocity information from spectral imaging observations using machine learning techniques. This software package is intended to be used by solar physicists trying to extract line-of-sight (LOS) Doppler velocity information from spectral imaging observations (Stokes $I$ measurements) of the Sun. This `toolkit' can be used to define a spectral model optimised for a particular dataset.

This package is particularly suited for extracting velocity information from spectral imaging observations where the individual spectra can contain multiple spectral components. Such multiple components are typically present when active solar phenomena occur within an isolated region of the solar disk. Spectra within such a region will often have a large emission component superimposed on top of the underlying absorption spectral profile from the quiescent solar atmosphere [@Felipe:2014]. Being able to extract velocity information from such observations would provide solar physicists with a wider range of data products that can be used for science [@Stangalini:2020]. This package implements the novel approach of automated classification of spectral profiles prior to fitting a model.

A sample model is provided for an IBIS Ca $\text{\sc{ii}}$ 8542 Ã… spectral imaging sunspot dataset. This dataset typically contains spectra with multiple atmospheric components and this package supports the isolation of the individual components such that velocity information can be constrained for each component. The method implemented in this IBIS model has been discussed extensively in @MacBride:2020. There are also several ongoing research projects using this model to extract velocity measurements.

Using this sample model, as well as the separate base (template) model it is built upon, a custom model can easily be built for a specific dataset. The custom model can be designed to take into account the spectral shape of each particular spectrum in the dataset. By training a neural network classifier using a sample of spectra from the dataset labelled with their spectral shapes, the spectral shape of any spectrum in the dataset can be found. The fitting algorithm can then be adjusted for each spectrum based on the particular spectral shape the neural network assigned it. The `toolkit' nature of this package also allows the possibility of utilising existing machine learning classifiers, such as the ``supervised hierarchical $k$-means" classifier introduced in @Panos:2018, which clusters solar flare spectra based on their profile shape.

This package is designed to run in parallel over large data cubes, as well as in serial. As each spectrum is processed in isolation, this package scales very well across many processor cores. Numerous functions are provided to plot the results clearly, some of which are showcased in \autoref{fig:example}. The `MCALF` API also contains many useful functions which have the potential of being integrated into other Python packages. Full documentation as well as examples on how to use `MCALF` are provided at [mcalf.macbride.me](https://mcalf.macbride.me).

'Anaconda Prompt':

.. code:: bash

    $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
    $ conda config --set channel_priority strict
    $ conda install mcalf

MCALF is updated to the latest version by running:

.. code:: bash

    $ conda update mcalf

Alternatively, you can install MCALF using ``pip``:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install mcalf

Testing
-------

A test suite is included with the package. The package is tested on
multiple platforms, however you may wish to run the tests on your
system also.

Installing Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using MCALF with pip
====================

To run the tests you need a number of extra packages installed. If you
installed MCALF using pip, you can run ``pip install mcalf[tests]`` to
install the additional testing dependencies (and MCALF if it's not
already installed).

Using MCALF with conda
======================

If you want to use MCALF inside a conda environment you should first
follow the conda installation instructions above. Once MCALF is
installed in a conda environment, ask conda to install each of MCALF's
testing dependencies using the following command.
(See `setup.cfg`_ for an up-to-date list of dependencies.)

.. code:: bash

    $ conda install pytest pytest-cov tox

Running Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tests should be run within the virtual environment where MCALF and its
testing dependencies were installed. Run the following command to test
your installation,

.. code:: bash

    $ pytest --pyargs mcalf

Editing the Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are planning on making changes to your local version of the code,
it is recommended to run the test suite to help ensure that the changes
do not introduce problems elsewhere.

Before making changes, you'll need to set up a development environment.
The SunPy Community have compiled an excellent set of instructions and
is available in their `documentation`_. You can mostly replace
``sunpy`` with ``mcalf``, and install with

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install -e .[tests,docs]

After making changes to the MCALF source, run the MCALF test suite with
the following command (while in the same directory as ``setup.py``),

.. code:: bash

    $ pytest --pyargs mcalf --cov

The tox package has also been configured to run the MCALF test suite.

example1: Basic usage of the package
====================================

``FittingIBIS.ipynb``
---------------------

* `View code <FittingIBIS.ipynb>`_
* :download:`Download FittingIBIS.ipynb <FittingIBIS.ipynb>`

This file is an IPython Notebook containing examples of how to use the package
to accomplish typical tasks.

``FittingIBIS.pro``
-------------------

* :download:`Download FittingIBIS.pro <FittingIBIS.pro>`

This file is similar to ``FittingIBIS.ipynb`` file, except it written is IDL.
It is not recommended to use the IDL wrapper in production, just use it to
explore the code if you are familiar with IDL and not Python.
If you wish to use this package, please use the Python implementation.
IDL is not fully supported in the current version of the code for reasons
such as, the Python tuple datatype cannot be passed from IDL to Python,
resulting in certain function calls not being possible.

``config.yml``
--------------

* :download:`Download config.yml <config.yml>`

This is an example configuration file containing default parameters.
This can be easier than setting the parameters in the code.
The file follows the YAML_ format.

MCALF visualisation
*******************

This sub-package contains:

* Functions to plot the input spectrum and the fitted
  model.
* Functions to plot the spatial distribution and their
  general profile.
* Functions to plot the velocities calculated for a
  spectral imaging scan.

.. automodapi:: mcalf.visualisation
MCALF profiles
**************

This sub-package contains:

* Functions that can be used to model the spectra.
* Voigt profile with a variety of wrappers for different
  applications (`mcalf.profiles.voigt`).
* Gaussian profiles and skew normal distributions
  (`mcalf.profiles.gaussian`).

MCALF utils
***********

This sub-package contains:

* Functions for processing spectra (`mcalf.utils.spec`).
* Functions for smoothing n-dimensional arrays
  (`mcalf.utils.smooth`).
* Functions for masking the input data to limit the
  region computed (`mcalf.utils.mask`).
* Functions for helping with plotting (`mcalf.utils.plot`).
* Classes for managing collections of data (`mcalf.utils.collections`).
* Miscellaneous utility functions (`mcalf.utils.misc`).

mcalf Package
=============

MCALF: Multi-Component Atmospheric Line Fitting
-----------------------------------------------

MCALF is an open-source Python package for accurately constraining
velocity information from spectral imaging observations using
machine learning techniques.
MCALF models
************

This sub-package contains:

* Base and sample models that can be adapted and fitted to any spectral
  imaging dataset.
* Models optimised for particular data sets that can be used directly.
* Data structures for storing and exporting the fitted parameters, as
  well as simplifying the calculation of velocities.
