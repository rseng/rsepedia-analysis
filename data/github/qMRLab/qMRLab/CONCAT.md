# Summary

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized the way we look at the human body. However, conventional MR scanners are not measurement devices. They produce digital images represented by ‚Äúshades of grey‚Äù, and the intensity of the shades depends on the way the images are acquired. This is why it is difficult to compare images acquired at different clinical sites, limiting the diagnostic, prognostic, and scientific potential of the technology.

Quantitative MRI (qMRI) aims to overcome this problem by assigning units to MR images, ensuring that the values represent a measurable quantity that can be reproduced within and across sites. While the vision for quantitative MRI is to overcome site-dependent variations, this is still a challenge due to variability in the hardware and software used by MR vendors to produce quantitative MRI maps.

Although qMRI has yet to enter mainstream clinical use, imaging scientists see great promise in the technique's potential to characterize tissue microstructure. However, most qMRI tools for fundamental research are developed in-house and are difficult to port across sites, which in turn hampers their standardization, reproducibility, and widespread adoption.

To tackle this problem, we developed qMRLab, an open-source software package that provides a wide selection of qMRI methods for data fitting, simulation and protocol optimization \autoref{fig:header}. It not only brings qMRI under one umbrella, but also facilitates its use through documentation that features online executable notebooks, a user friendly graphical user interface (GUI), interactive tutorials and blog posts.

![qMRLab is an open-source software for quantitative MRI analysis It provides a myriad of methods to characterize microstructural tissue properties, from relaxometry to magnetization transfer.\label{fig:header}](https://github.com/qMRLab/qMRLab/raw/master/docs/logo/page_header.png)

MATLAB is the native development language of qMRLab, primarily because it is by far the most common choice among MRI methods developers. However, we have made a strong effort to lower licensing and accessibility barriers by supporting Octave compatibility and Docker containerization.

qMRLab started as a spin-off project of qMTLab [@cabana:2015]. In the meantime, a few other open-source software packages were developed, addressing  the lack of qMRI consistency  from different angles. QUIT [@wood:2018] implemented an array of qMRI methods in C++, which is highly favorable as an on-site solution because of its speed. The hMRI toolbox [@tabelow:2019] was developed as an SPM [@ashburner:2012] module that expands on the multi-parametric mapping method [@weiskopf:2008]. Other tools such as mrQ [@mezer:2016] and QMAP [@samsonov:2011] are also primarily designed for brain imaging. In addition to the arrival of community-developed tools for multi-modal qMRI processing, the field of diffusion MRI (dMRI) has recently witnessed an increase in the development of open-source software, bringing more transparency to the diffusion-based microstructural characterization of the brain. For example, the Dmipy Toolbox implemented an array of multi-compartment diffusion models in Python [@fick:2019], another Python package DIPY brought together dMRI processing methods at multiple levels [@garyfallidis:2014], Camino was developed in Java to provide users with yet another dMRI pipeline [@cook:2006] and TractoFlow [@theaud:2020] introduced container-based reproducible dMRI workflows developed in Nextflow pipeline orchestration tool [@di:2017]. Yet, brain imaging is not the only qMRI area slowed down by lack of consistency. Recently we published a preprint demonstrating notable disagreements between cardiac qMRI methods [@hafyane:2018]. Open-source software can go a long way in explaining these discrepancies, and the cardiac imaging community was recently introduced to TOMATO [@werys:2020], an open C++ framework for parametric cardiac MRI.

As open-source practices in the realm of qMRI become more popular, the need for effective communication of these tools also increases. This is important not only because we need consistency and transparency in the implementations, but also because non-specialist qMRI users would benefit from better understanding of the methodology. To this end, we envision qMRLab as a powerful tool with which users can easily interact with various techniques, perform simulations, design their experiments and fit their data. We reinforce this vision through our web portal (https://qmrlab.org) that includes interactive tutorials, blog posts and Jupyter Notebooks running on BinderHub, all tailored to a wide range of qMRI methods. The qMRLab portal is open for community contributions.

Currently, qMRLab is used by dozens of research labs around the world, mostly, but not limited to, application in brain and spinal cord imaging. A list of published studies using qMRLab is available on our GitHub repository.

While closed solutions may be sufficient for qualitative MRI (shades of grey lack standardized units), quantitative MRI will not realize its potential if we cannot peek inside the black box that generates the numbers. With qMRLab we want to open the black boxes developed in-house and reach a critical mass of users across all MR vendor platforms, while also encouraging developers to contribute to a central repository where all features and bugs are in the open. We hope that this concept will level the field for MR quantification and open the door to vendor-neutrality. We've been sitting in our MR cathedrals long enough. It is now time to join the MR bazaar [@raymond:1999]!

# AxonPacking: Simulator of White Matter Axons Arrangement

## Description 

Here is  a new random disks packing algorithm for numerical simulation of the white matter. 

White matter tissue is divided in three compartments:  axons, myelin sheath and extra-axonal space. Axons are assumed to be parallel cylinders, therefore the invariance along the fiber axis makes it possible to consider this problem in 2D. The dense packing of axons is thus equivalent to the generation of random 2-dimensional packing of N perfectly round and non-compressible disks. Axon diameter distributions follow a Gamma distribution (defined by its mean ¬µ and variance œÉ2). Interestingly the g-ratio is fairly constant across species and white matter regions (31,32) and is dependent mostly on the diameter of the axon according to the relationship presented in (Ikeda M, Oka Y. Brain Behav. 2012):  gratio= 0.220 * log(DIAMETER_unmyelinated) +0.508. 

The different steps to process packing are the following: first, the diameters of the disks are randomly chosen using a gamma or lognormal distribution parameterized with the mean (d_mean), variance (d_var) and number of axons (N).  Then, the positions of disks are initialized on a grid, and they migrate toward the center of the packing area until the maximum disk density is achieved. 


The software packing provides microstructure features (Fiber Volume Fraction FVF, Myelin Volume Fraction MVF, Axon Volume Fraction AVF, fraction restricted FR).

## Scripts

- main.m
- axons_setup.m
- process_packing.m
- compute_gratio.m
- compute_statistics.m
- progressBar.m

## How to use it ?

### INPUTS
In ‚Äòmain.m‚Äô change the inputs

- N : the number of disks i.e axons to include in the simulation
- d_mean and d_var : the diameter distribution parameters : mean ¬µ and variance œÉ¬≤ of disk diameters 
- Delta : the fixed gap between the edge of disks Œî 
- iter_max : the number of iterations i.e disk migrations performed by the algorithm before computing the outputs 

#### Help 	
The disk density increases over the migrations and tends toward a limit value. It is necessary to first launch the algorithm with a high number of iterations iter_max. The disk density i.e FVF is calculated every 'iter_fvf' iterations to assess the sufficient number of iterations to reach convergence. 'iter_fvf' is a user defined integer: iter_fvf = iter_max/10 by default. 

When d_mean closed to 3 um, d_var  closed to 1 um : 
 - if N about 1000, iter_max = 30000 is sufficient. 
 - if N about 100, iter_max = 10000 is sufficient. 

#### Example  	
N = 100;            
d_mean = 3;         
d_var  = 1;        
Delta  = 0; 
iter_max = 10000;                            

### OUPUTS
The function ‚ÄòcomputeStatistics.m‚Äô provides MVF, AVF, FVF and FR for each packing image defined by the input combinations. To do that it creates a binary mask.

Outputs are stored in 3 matlab structures. 

- in 'axons.mat' :  the axon features (N, d_mean, d_var, Delta, g_ratio and the drawn diameters d)
- in 'packing.mat' : the packing results (initial positions of disks (initial_positions) and final positions of disks (final_positions))
- in 'stats.mat' : the statistics results with the values for each metric computed in the packing (FVF, FR, MVF, AVF) 

A png image of the final packing with three different labels (intra-axonal, myelin and extra-axonal) is saved by default in the current script folder.

# DICOM to NIfTI conversion, DICOM and NIfTI tools, NIfTI visualization (version 2019.06.24)

# dicm2nii
Convert DICOM into NIfTI. It can also convert PAR/XML/REC, HEAD/BRIK, MGZ and BrainVoyager files into NIfTI.

# nii_tool
Create, load, save NIfTI file. Support both version 1 and 2 NIfTI, and variety of data type.

# nii_viewer

# rename_dicm, sort_dicm, anonymize_dicm
DICOM tools performing the tasks as indicated by the name.
# imtool3D
This is an image viewer designed to view a 3D stack of image slices. For example, if you load into matlab a DICOM series of CT or MRI images, you can visualize the images easily using this tool. It lets you scroll through slices, adjust the window and level, make ROI measurements, and export images into standard image formats (e.g., .png, .jpg, or .tif) or the 3D mask as NIFTI file (.nii). Use imtool3D_nii to load NIFTI files.
This tool is written using the object-oriented features of matlab. This means that you can treat the tool like any graphics object and it can easily be embedded into any figure. So if you're designing a GUI in which you need the user to visualize and scroll through image slices, you don't need to write all the code for that! Its already done in this tool! Just create an imtool3D object and put it in your GUI figure.

<p align="center">

imtool3D is used heavily by several other projects:
* [qMRLab](https://github.com/qMRLab/qMRLab)
* [imquest](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/railabs/SameiResearchGroup/imquest)
* [lesionTool](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/railabs/SameiResearchGroup/lesionTool)

# Dependencies
* Matlab's image processing toolbox (ROI tools are disabled otherwise)
* [dicm2nii](https://github.com/xiangruili/dicm2nii) (if NIFTI images are used)

# Tuto

See also [PyBIDS](https://github.com/bids-standard/pybids) for Python and the [BIDS Starter Kit](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit).

## Implementation

Starting point was `spm_BIDS.m` from [SPM12](https://github.com/spm/spm12) ([documentation](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPM/BIDS#BIDS_parser_and_queries)) reformatted in a `+bids` package with dependencies to other SPM functions removed.

## Example

```Matlab
BIDS = bids.layout('/home/data/ds000117');
bids.query(BIDS, 'subjects')
```# AMICO

> *Alessandro Daducci, Erick Canales-Rodriguez, Hui Zhang, Tim Dyrby, Daniel Alexander, Jean-Philippe Thiran*  
> NeuroImage 105, pp. 32-44 (2015)

## Code implementation

This is the first/original version implementation of the AMICO framework and is written in MATLAB. **THIS CODE IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED**.

NB: the official version of AMICO is written in **Python** can be found [`here`](https://github.com/daducci/AMICO).

# Installation

## Download and install external software

- **NODDI MATLAB toolbox**. [Download](http://mig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/index.php?n=Download.NODDI) the software and follow the instructions provided [here](http://mig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/index.php?n=Tutorial.NODDImatlab) to install it.  

- **CAMINO toolkit**. [Download](http://cmic.cs.ucl.ac.uk/camino//index.php?n=Main.Download) the software and follow the instructions provided [here](http://cmic.cs.ucl.ac.uk/camino//index.php?n=Main.Installation) to install it.  

- **SPArse Modeling Software (SPAMS)**. [Download](http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/downloads.html) the software and follow the instructions provided [here](http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/doc/html/doc_spams003.html) to install it.  

## Setup paths/variables in MATLAB

Add the folder containing the source code of AMICO to your `MATLAB PATH`.

Copy the file `AMICO_Setup.txt` and rename it to `AMICO_Setup.m`. Modify its content to set the paths to your specific needs, as follows:

- `AMICO_code_path` : path to the folder containing the *MATLAB source code* of AMICO (this repository). E.g. `/home/user/AMICO/code/matlab`.

- `NODDI_path` : path to the folder containing the *source code* of the NODDI toolbox (in case you want to use NODDI, not needed for ActiveAx). E.g. `/home/user/NODDI_toolbox_v0.9`.

- `CAMINO_path` : path to the `bin` folder containing the *executables* of the Camino toolkit (in case you want to use ActiveAx, not needed for NODDI). E.g. `/home/user/camino/bin`.

- `SPAMS_path` : path to the folder containing the *source code* of the SPAMS Library. E.g. `/home/user/spams`.

- `AMICO_data_path` : path to the folder where you store all your datasets. E.g. `/home/user/AMICO/data`. Then, the software assumes the folder structure is the following:

    ```
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Study_01                 --> all subjects acquired with protocol "Study_01"
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Subject_01
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Subject_02
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Study_02                 --> all subjects acquired with protocol "Study_02"
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Subject_01
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Subject_02
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ```
  This way, the kernels need to be computed only *once per each study*, i.e. same protocol (number of shells, b-values etc), and subsequently adapted to each subject (specific gradient directions) very efficiently.


# Getting started

Tutorials/demos are provided in the folder [`doc/demos/`](doc/demos/) to help you get started with the AMICO framework.
# Tutorials/demos

This folder contains a series of tutorials/demos to show how to use the AMICO framework.# NODDI fitting tutorial

This tutorial shows how to use the AMICO framework to **fit the NODDI model**, using the example dataset distributed with the [NODDI Matlab Toolbox](http://mig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/index.php?n=Tutorial.NODDImatlab).

## Download data for this tutorial

1. Download the original DWI data from [here](http://www.nitrc.org/frs/download.php/5508/NODDI_example_dataset.zip).
2. Create the folder `NoddiTutorial/Tutorial` in your data folder and extract into it the content of the downloaded archive `NODDI_example_dataset.zip`.
3. Copy the scheme file `NODDI_DWI.scheme` distributed with this tutorial into the folder.

## Setup AMICO

Setup the AMICO environment:

```matlab
clearvars, clearvars -global, clc

% Setup AMICO
AMICO_Setup

% Pre-compute auxiliary matrices to speed-up the computations
AMICO_PrecomputeRotationMatrices(); % NB: this needs to be done only once and for all
```

## Load the data

Load the data:

```matlab
% Set the folder containing the data (relative to the data folder).
% This will create a CONFIG structure to keep all the parameters.
AMICO_SetSubject( 'NoddiTutorial', 'Tutorial' );

% Override default file names
CONFIG.dwiFilename    = fullfile( CONFIG.DATA_path, 'NODDI_DWI.hdr' );
CONFIG.maskFilename   = fullfile( CONFIG.DATA_path, 'roi_mask.hdr' );
CONFIG.schemeFilename = fullfile( CONFIG.DATA_path, 'NODDI_DWI.scheme' );

% Load the dataset in memory
AMICO_LoadData
```

The output will look like:

```
-> Loading and setup:
	* Loading DWI...
		- dim    = 128 x 128 x 50 x 81
		- pixdim = 1.875 x 1.875 x 2.500
	* Loading SCHEME...
		- 81 measurements divided in 2 shells (9 b=0)
	* Loading MASK...
		- dim    = 128 x 128 x 50
		- voxels = 5478
   [ DONE ]
```

## Generate the kernels

Generate the kernels corresponding to the different compartments of the NODDI model:

```matlab
% Setup AMICO to use the 'NODDI' model
AMICO_SetModel( 'NODDI' );

% Generate the kernels corresponding to the protocol
AMICO_GenerateKernels( false );

% Resample the kernels to match the specific subject's scheme
AMICO_ResampleKernels();
```

- Can be used directly with continuous integration services, such as [coveralls.io] and [Shippable].
- Integrates with [MOxUnit], a unit test framework for Matlab and GNU Octave.
- Supports the Matlab profiler.
- Writes coverage reports in HTML, JSON and XML formats.
- Distributed under the MIT license, a permissive free software license.


### Installation

- Using the shell (requires a Unix-like operating system such as GNU/Linux or Apple OSX):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MOcov/MOcov.git
    cd MOcov
    make install
    ```
    This will add the MOcov directory to the Matlab and/or GNU Octave search path. If both Matlab and GNU Octave are available on your machine, it will install MOcov for both.

- Manual installation:

    + Download the zip archive from the [MOcov] website.
    + Start Matlab or GNU Octave.
    + On the Matlab or GNU Octave prompt, `cd` to the `MOcov` root directory, then run:
    
        ```matlab
        cd MOcov            % cd to MOcov subdirectory
        addpath(pwd)        % add the current directory to the Matlab/GNU Octave path
        savepath            % save the path
        ```


### Determining coverage

Coverage can be determined for evaluating a single expression or evaluation of a single function handle; for typical use cases this invokes running a test suite. 

There are two methods to generate coverage while evaluating such an expression or function handle:

1. the 'file' method (default)

    - Coverage information is stored internally by the function `mocov_line_covered`, which keeps this information through the use of persistent variables. Initially the coverage information is reset to being empty.
    - This method considers all files in a directory (and its subdirectories).
    - A temporary directory is created where modified versions of each file is stored.
    - Prior to evaluting the expression or function handle, for each file, MOcov determines which of its lines can be executed. Each line that can be executed is prefixed by a call to `mocov_line_covered`, which cause it to update internal state to record the filename and line number that was executed, and the result stored in the temporary directory.
    - The search path is updated to include the new temporary directory.
    
    After evaluating the expression or function handle, the temporary directory is deleted and the search path restored. Line coverage information is then extracted from the internal state of `mocov_line_covered`.
    
    This method runs on both GNU Octave and Matlab, but is typically slow.

2. the 'profile' method
    - It uses the Matlab profiler. 
    - This method runs on Matlab only (not on GNU Octave), but is generally faster.


### Use cases

Typical use cases for MOcov are:

-   Locally run code with coverage for code in a unit test framework on GNU Octave or Matlab. Use

    ```matlab    
        mocov('-cover','path/with/code',...
                '-expression','run_test_command',...
                '-cover_json_file','coverage.json',...
                '-cover_xml_file','coverage.xml',...
                '-cover_html_dir','coverage_html',
                '-method','file');
    ```

    to generate coverage reports for all files in the `'path/with/code'` directory when `running eval('run_test_command')`. Results are stored in JSON, XML and HTML formats.

-   As a specific example of the use case above, when using the [MOxUnit] unit test platform such tests can be run as

    ```matlab
        success=moxunit_runtests('path/with/tests',...
                                    '-with_coverage',...
                                    '-cover','/path/with/code',...
                                    '-cover_xml_file','coverage.xml',...
                                    '-cover_html_dir','coverage_html');
    ```

    where `'path/with/tests'` contains unit tests. In this case, `moxunit_runtests` will call the `mocov` function to generate coverage reports.

-   On the Matlab platform, results from `profile('info')` can be stored in JSON, XML or HTML formats directly. In the following:

    ```matlab
        % enable profiler
        profile on;

        % run code for which coverage is to be determined
        <your code here>

        % write coverage based on profile('info')
        mocov('-cover','path/with/code',...
                '-profile_info',...
                '-cover_json_file','coverage.json',...
                '-cover_xml_file','coverage.xml',...
                '-cover_html_dir','coverage_html');
    ```

    coverage results are stored in JSON, XML and HTML formats.

-   Use with continuous integration service, such as [Shippable] or [travis-ci] combined with [coveralls.io]. See the   [travis.yml configuration file] in the [MOxUnit] project for an example.


### Use with travis-ci and Shippable
MOcov can be used with the [Travis-ci] and [Shippable] services for continuous integration testing. This is achieved by setting up a `travis.yml` file. Due to recursiveness issues, MOcov cannot use these services to generate coverage reports for itself; for an example in the related [MOxUnit] project, see the [travis.yml configuration file] file.


### Compatibility notes
- Because GNU Octave 3.8 and 4.0 do not support `classdef` syntax, 'old-style' object-oriented syntax is used for the class definitions. 


### Limitations
- The 'file' method uses a very simple parser, which may not work as expected in all cases.
- Currently there is only support to generate coverage reports for files in a single directory (and its subdirectory).

## Features

- Runs on both the [Matlab] and [GNU Octave] platforms.
- Uses object-oriented TestCase, TestSuite and TestResult classes, allowing for user-defined extensions.
- Can be used directly with continuous integration services, such as [Travis-ci] and [Shippable].
- Supports JUnit-like XML output for use with Shippable and other test results visualization approaches.
- Supports the generation of code coverage reports using [MOCov]
- Provides compatibility with the (now unsupported) Steve Eddin's [Matlab xUnit test framework], and with recent Matlab test functionality.
- Distributed under the MIT license, a permissive free software license.

## Installation

- Using the shell (requires a Unix-like operating system such as GNU/Linux or Apple OSX):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MOxUnit/MOxUnit.git
    cd MOxUnit
    make install
    ```
    This will add the MOxUnit directory to the Matlab and/or GNU Octave searchpath. If both Matlab and GNU Octave are available on your machine, it will install MOxUnit for both.

- Manual installation:

    + Download the [[MOxUnit zip archive] from the [MOxUnit] website, and extract it. This should
      result in a directory called ``MOxUnit-master``.
    + Start Matlab or GNU Octave.
    + On the Matlab or GNU Octave prompt, go to the directory that contains the new ``MOxUnit-master`` directory, then run:

        ```matlab
        % change to the MOxUnit subdirectory
        %
        % Note: if MOxUnit was retrieved using 'git', then the name of
        %       top-level directory is 'MOxUnit', not 'MOxUnit-master'
        cd MOxUnit-master/MoxUnit

        % add the current directory to the Matlab/GNU Octave path
        moxunit_set_path()

        % save the path
        savepath
        ```

## Defining MOxUnit tests

To define unit tests, write a function with the following header:

```matlab
function test_suite=test_of_abs
    try % assignment of 'localfunctions' is necessary in Matlab >= 2016
        test_functions=localfunctions();
    catch % no problem; early Matlab versions can use initTestSuite fine
    end
    initTestSuite;
```

### Important <!-- omit in toc -->

- It is crucial that the output of the main function is a variable named `test_suite`, and that the output of `localfunctions` is assigned to a variable named `test_functions`.
- As of Matlab 2016b, Matlab scripts (such as `initTestSuite.m`) do not have access to subfunctions in a function if called from that function. Therefore it requires using localfunctions to obtain function handles to local functions. The "try-catch-end" statements are necessary for compatibility with older versions of GNU Octave, which do not provide the `localfunctions` function.
- Alas, the call to `localfunctions` **cannot** be incorporated into `initTestSuite` so the entire code snippet above has to be the header of each test file

Then, define subfunctions whose name start with `test` or end with `test` (case-insensitive). These functions can use the following `assert*` functions:

- `assertTrue(a)`: assert that `a` is true.
- `assertFalse(a)`: assert that `a` is false.
- `assertEqual(a,b)`: assert that `a` and `b` are equal.
- `assertElementsAlmostEqual(a,b)`: assert that the floating point arrays `a` and `b` have the same size, and that corresponding elements are equal within some numeric tolerance.
- `assertVectorsAlmostEqual(a,b)`: assert that floating point vectors `a` and `b` have the same size, and are equal within some numeric tolerance based on their vector norm.
- `assertExceptionThrown(f,id)`: assert that calling `f()` throws an exception with identifier `id`. (To deal with cases where Matlab and GNU Octave throw errors with different identifiers, use `moxunit_util_platform_is_octave`. Or use `id='*'` to match any identifier).

As a special case, `moxunit_throw_test_skipped_exception('reason')` throws an exception that is caught when running the test; `moxunit_run_tests` will report that the test is skipped for reason `reason`.

For example, the following function defines three unit tests that tests some possible inputs from the builtin `abs` function:

```matlab
function test_suite=test_of_abs
    try % assignment of 'localfunctions' is necessary in Matlab >= 2016
        test_functions=localfunctions();
    catch % no problem; early Matlab versions can use initTestSuite fine
    end
    initTestSuite;

function test_abs_scalar
    assertTrue(abs(-1)==1)
    assertEqual(abs(-NaN),NaN);
    assertEqual(abs(-Inf),Inf);
    assertEqual(abs(0),0)
    assertElementsAlmostEqual(abs(-1e-13),0)

function test_abs_vector
    assertEqual(abs([-1 1 -3]),[1 1 3]);

function test_abs_exceptions
    % GNU Octave and Matlab use different error identifiers
    if moxunit_util_platform_is_octave()
        assertExceptionThrown(@()abs(struct),'');
    else
        assertExceptionThrown(@()abs(struct),...
                             'MATLAB:UndefinedFunction');
    end
```

Examples of unit tests are in MOxUnit's `tests` directory, which test some of MOxUnit's functions itself.

## Running MOxUnit tests

- `cd` to the directory where the unit tests reside. For MOxUnit itself, the unit tests are in the directory `tests`.
- run the tests using `moxunit_runtests`. For example, running `moxunit_runtests` from MOxUnit's `tests` directory runs tests for MOxUnit itself, and should give the following output:

  ```matlab
  >> moxunit_runtests
  suite: 98 tests
  ............................................................
  ......................................
  --------------------------------------------------

  OK (passed=98)
  ans =
    logical
    1
  ```

- `moxunit_runtests`, by default, gives non-verbose output and runs all tests in the current directory. This can be changed using the following arguments:
  - `-verbose`: show verbose output.
  - `-quiet`: supress all output
  - `directory`: run unit tests in directory `directory`.
  - `file.m`: run unit tests in file `file.m`.
  - `-recursive`: add files from directories recursively.
  - `-logfile logfile.txt`: store the output in file `logfile.txt`.
  - `-junit_xml_file xmlfile`: store JUnit-like XML output in file `xmlfile`.

- To test MOxUnit itself from a terminal, run:

  ```
  make test
  ```

## Use with CI

MOxUnit can be used with the [Travis-ci] service for continuous integration (CI) testing. This is achieved by setting up a [.travis.yml configuration file](.travis.yml). This file is also used by [Shippable]. As a result, the test suite is run automatically on both [Travis-ci] and [Shippable] every time it is pushed to the github repository, or when a pull request is made. If a test fails, or if all tests pass after a test failed before, the developers are notified by email.

### Octave

The easiest test to set up on Travis and/or Shippable is with [GNU Octave]. Make sure your code is Octave compatible. Note that many Matlab projects tend to use functionality not present in Octave (such as particular functions), whereasand writing code that is both Matlab- and Octave-compatible may require some additional efforts.

A simple `.travis.yml` file for a project could look like that:

```yaml
language: generic
os: linux
      
before_install:
  - sudo apt-get install octave

before_script:
  - git clone https://github.com/MOxUnit/MOxUnit.git
  - make -C MOxUnit install

script:        
  - make test
```

In this case `make test` is used to run the tests. To avoid a Makefile and run tests directly through Octave, the script has to call Octave directly to run the tests:

  ```yaml
  # ...
  before_script:
  - git clone https://github.com/MOxUnit/MOxUnit.git

  script:
    - octave --no-gui --eval "addpath('~/git/MOxUnit/MOxUnit');moxunit_set_path;moxunit_runtests('tests')"
  ```

Note that MOxUnit tests **itself** on travis, with [this](https://github.com/MOxUnit/MOxUnit/blob/master/.travis.yml) travis file.

### Matlab

Travis [now supports Matlab](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/matlab/) directly. You can use MOxUnit with it, but its tricky because:
  1) Travis only supports Matlab 2020a and, presumably, higher (at the time of writing 2020a is the newest version).
  2) Makefile installation does not work with Matlab on travis.
  3) Nor does calling Matlab from the command line in a usual way - with ` matlab -nodesktop -nosplash ...` . Instead it has to be called with the `-batch` flag.
  
  Therefore, `.travis.yml` file looks as follows:
  ```yml
  language: matlab
  matlab: R2020a
  os: linux

  # Just clone MOxUnit, `don't make install` it (!)
  before_script:
    - git clone https://github.com/MOxUnit/MOxUnit.git
      
  script: 
    - matlab -batch 'back=cd("./MOxUnit/MOxUnit/"); moxunit_set_path(); cd(back); moxunit_runtests tests -verbose; exit(double(~ans))'
  ```

  `exit(double(~ans))` ensures that the build fails if MOxUnit tests fail.

## Compatibility notes

- Because GNU Octave 3.8 does not support `classdef` syntax, 'old-style' object-oriented syntax is used for the class definitions. For similar reasons, MOxUnit uses the `lasterror` function, even though its use in Matlab is discouraged.
- Recent versions of Matlab (2016 and later) do not support tests defined just using "initTestSuite", that is without the use of `localfunctions` (see above). To ease the transition, consider using the Python script `tools/fix_mfile_test_init.py`, which can update existing .m files that do not use `localfunctions`.

  For example, the following command was used on a Unix-like shell to preview changes to MOxUnit's tests:

  ```bash
    find tests -iname 'test*.m' | xargs -L1 tools/fix_mfile_test_init.py
  ```

  and adding the `--apply` option applies these changes, meaning that found files are rewritten:

  ```bash
    find tests -iname 'test*.m' | xargs -L1 tools/fix_mfile_test_init.py --apply
  ```
- Recent versions of Matlab define a `matlab.unittest.Test` class for unit tests. An instance `t` can be used with MOxUnit using the `MOxUnitMatlabUnitWrapperTestCase(t)`, which is a `MOxUnitTestCase` instance. Tests that are defined through

  ```matlab
  function tests=foo()
      tests=functiontests(localfunctions)

  function test_funcA(param)

  function test_funcA(param)
  ```

  can be run using MOxUnit as well (and included in an ``MOxUnitTestSuite`` instance using its with ``addFile``) instance, with the exception that currently setup and teardown functions are currently ignored.

## Limitations

Currently MOxUnit does not support:
- Documentation tests require [MOdox].
- Support for setup and teardown functions in `TestCase` classes.
- Subclasses of MOxUnit's classes (`MOxUnitTestCase`, `MOxUnitTestSuite`, `MOxUnitTestReport`) have to be defined using "old-style" object-oriented syntax.
- Subtests

Introduction
============

JSON (`JavaScript Object Notation <http://www.json.org/>`_) is a highly portable, 
human-readable and " `fat-free <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>`_" text format 
to represent complex and hierarchical data. It is as powerful as `XML <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML>`_, but less verbose. JSON format is widely used for data-exchange in applications, and is essential for the wild success 
of (programming) `Ajax <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_>`_ and `Web2.0 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0>`_.

UBJSON (Universal Binary JSON) is a binary JSON format, specifically 
optimized for compact file size and better performance while keeping
the semantics as simple as the text-based JSON format. Using the UBJSON
format allows to wrap complex binary data in a flexible and extensible
structure, making it possible to process complex and large dataset 
without accuracy loss due to text conversions.

We envision that both JSON and its binary version will serve as part of 
the mainstream data-exchange formats for scientific research in the future. 
It will provide the flexibility and generality achieved by other popular 
general-purpose file specifications, such as  `HDF5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/whatishdf5.html>`_, with significantly 
reduced complexity and enhanced performance.

JSONLab is a free and open-source implementation of a JSON/UBJSON encoder 
and a decoder in the native MATLAB language. It can be used to convert a MATLAB 
data structure (array, struct, cell, struct array and cell array) into 
JSON/UBJSON formatted strings, or to decode a JSON/UBJSON file into MATLAB 
data structure. JSONLab supports both MATLAB and `GNU Octave <http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/>`_ (a free MATLAB clone).

================
Installation
================

The installation of JSONLab is no different than any other simple
MATLAB toolbox. You only need to download/unzip the JSONLab package
to a folder, and add the folder's path to MATLAB/Octave's path list
by using the following command:

.. code:: shell

    addpath('/path/to/jsonlab');

If you want to add this path permanently, you need to type "pathtool", 
browse to the jsonlab root folder and add to the list, then click "Save".
Then, run "rehash" in MATLAB, and type "which loadjson", if you see an 
output, that means JSONLab is installed for MATLAB/Octave.


================
Using JSONLab
================

JSONLab provides two functions, loadjson.m -- a MATLAB->JSON decoder, 
and savejson.m -- a MATLAB->JSON encoder, for the text-based JSON, and 
two equivalent functions -- loadubjson and saveubjson for the binary 
JSON. The detailed help info for the four functions can be found below:

        input:
             fname: input file name, if fname contains "{}" or "[]", fname
                    will be interpreted as a JSON string
             opt: a struct to store parsing options, opt can be replaced by 
                  a list of ('param',value) pairs - the param string is equivalent
                  to a field in opt. opt can have the following 
                  fields (first in [.|.] is the default)

                  opt.SimplifyCell [0|1]: if set to 1, loadjson will call cell2mat
                                for each element of the JSON data, and group 
                                arrays based on the cell2mat rules.
                  opt.FastArrayParser [1|0 or integer]: if set to 1, use a
                                speed-optimized array parser when loading an 
                                array object. The fast array parser may 
                                collapse block arrays into a single large
                                array similar to rules defined in cell2mat; 0 to 
                                use a legacy parser; if set to a larger-than-1
                                value, this option will specify the minimum
                                dimension to enable the fast array parser. For
                                example, if the input is a 3D array, setting
                                FastArrayParser to 1 will return a 3D array;
                                setting to 2 will return a cell array of 2D
                                arrays; setting to 3 will return to a 2D cell
                                array of 1D vectors; setting to 4 will return a
                                3D cell array.
                  opt.ShowProgress [0|1]: if set to 1, loadjson displays a progress bar.

        output:
             dat: a cell array, where {...} blocks are converted into cell arrays,
                  and [...] are converted to arrays

             jsonmesh=struct('MeshNode',[0 0 0;1 0 0;0 1 0;1 1 0;0 0 1;1 0 1;0 1 1;1 1 1],... 
                      'MeshTetra',[1 2 4 8;1 3 4 8;1 2 6 8;1 5 6 8;1 5 7 8;1 3 7 8],...
                      'MeshTri',[1 2 4;1 2 6;1 3 4;1 3 7;1 5 6;1 5 7;...
                                 2 8 4;2 8 6;3 8 4;3 8 7;5 8 6;5 8 7],...
                      'MeshCreator','FangQ','MeshTitle','T6 Cube',...
                      'SpecialData',[nan, inf, -inf]);
             saveubjson('jsonmesh',jsonmesh)
             saveubjson('jsonmesh',jsonmesh,'meshdata.ubj')

examples

Under the ``"examples"`` folder, you can find several scripts to demonstrate the
basic utilities of JSONLab. Running the ``"demo_jsonlab_basic.m"`` script, you 
will see the conversions from MATLAB data structure to JSON text and backward.
In ``"jsonlab_selftest.m"``, we load complex JSON files downloaded from the Internet
and validate the ``loadjson/savejson`` functions for regression testing purposes.
Similarly, a ``"demo_ubjson_basic.m"`` script is provided to test the saveubjson
and loadubjson functions for various matlab data structures.

Please run these examples and understand how JSONLab works before you use
it to process your data.

=======================
Known Issues and TODOs
=======================

JSONLab has several known limitations. We are striving to make it more general
and robust. Hopefully in a few future releases, the limitations become less.

Here are the known issues:

  * 3D or higher dimensional cell/struct-arrays will be converted to 2D arrays
  
  * When processing names containing multi-byte characters, Octave and MATLAB can give different field-names; you can use feature('DefaultCharacterSet','latin1') in MATLAB to get consistent results
  
  * savejson can not handle class and dataset.
  
  * saveubjson converts a logical array into a uint8 ([U]) array
  
  * an unofficial N-D array count syntax is implemented in saveubjson. We are actively communicating with the UBJSON spec maintainer to investigate the possibility of making it upstream 
  
  * loadubjson can not parse all UBJSON Specification (Draft 9) compliant files, however, it can parse all UBJSON files produced by saveubjson.
