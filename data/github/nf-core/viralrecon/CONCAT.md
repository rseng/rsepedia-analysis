# Code of Conduct at nf-core (v1.0)

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, collaborative, and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of nf-core, pledge to making participation in our projects and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:

- Age
- Body size
- Familial status
- Gender identity and expression
- Geographical location
- Level of experience
- Nationality and national origins
- Native language
- Physical and neurological ability
- Race or ethnicity
- Religion
- Sexual identity and orientation
- Socioeconomic status

Please note that the list above is alphabetised and is therefore not ranked in any order of preference or importance.

## Preamble

> Note: This Code of Conduct (CoC) has been drafted by the nf-core Safety Officer and been edited after input from members of the nf-core team and others. "We", in this document, refers to the Safety Officer and members of the nf-core core team, both of whom are deemed to be members of the nf-core community and are therefore required to abide by this Code of Conduct. This document will amended periodically to keep it up-to-date, and in case of any dispute, the most current version will apply.

An up-to-date list of members of the nf-core core team can be found [here](https://nf-co.re/about). Our current safety officer is Renuka Kudva.

nf-core is a young and growing community that welcomes contributions from anyone with a shared vision for [Open Science Policies](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/taxonomy/term/8). Open science policies encompass inclusive behaviours and we strive to build and maintain a safe and inclusive environment for all individuals.

We have therefore adopted this code of conduct (CoC), which we require all members of our community and attendees in nf-core events to adhere to in all our workspaces at all times. Workspaces include but are not limited to Slack, meetings on Zoom, Jitsi, YouTube live etc.

Our CoC will be strictly enforced and the nf-core team reserve the right to exclude participants who do not comply with our guidelines from our workspaces and future nf-core activities.

We ask all members of our community to help maintain a supportive and productive workspace and to avoid behaviours that can make individuals feel unsafe or unwelcome. Please help us maintain and uphold this CoC.

Questions, concerns or ideas on what we can include? Contact safety [at] nf-co [dot] re

## Our Responsibilities

The safety officer is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

The safety officer in consultation with the nf-core core team have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Members of the core team or the safety officer who violate the CoC will be required to recuse themselves pending investigation. They will not have access to any reports of the violations and be subject to the same actions as others in violation of the CoC.

## When are where does this Code of Conduct apply?

Participation in the nf-core community is contingent on following these guidelines in all our workspaces and events. This includes but is not limited to the following listed alphabetically and therefore in no order of preference:

- Communicating with an official project email address.
- Communicating with community members within the nf-core Slack channel.
- Participating in hackathons organised by nf-core (both online and in-person events).
- Participating in collaborative work on GitHub, Google Suite, community calls, mentorship meetings, email correspondence.
- Participating in workshops, training, and seminar series organised by nf-core (both online and in-person events). This applies to events hosted on web-based platforms such as Zoom, Jitsi, YouTube live etc.
- Representing nf-core on social media. This includes both official and personal accounts.

## nf-core cares 😊

nf-core's CoC and expectations of respectful behaviours for all participants (including organisers and the nf-core team) include but are not limited to the following (listed in alphabetical order):

- Ask for consent before sharing another community member’s personal information (including photographs) on social media.
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences. We are all here to learn from one another and a difference in opinion can present a good learning opportunity.
- Celebrate your accomplishments at events! (Get creative with your use of emojis 🎉 🥳 💯 🙌 !)
- Demonstrate empathy towards other community members. (We don’t all have the same amount of time to dedicate to nf-core. If tasks are pending, don’t hesitate to gently remind members of your team. If you are leading a task, ask for help if you feel overwhelmed.)
- Engage with and enquire after others. (This is especially important given the geographically remote nature of the nf-core community, so let’s do this the best we can)
- Focus on what is best for the team and the community. (When in doubt, ask)
- Graciously accept constructive criticism, yet be unafraid to question, deliberate, and learn.
- Introduce yourself to members of the community. (We’ve all been outsiders and we know that talking to strangers can be hard for some, but remember we’re interested in getting to know you and your visions for open science!)
- Show appreciation and **provide clear feedback**. (This is especially important because we don’t see each other in person and it can be harder to interpret subtleties. Also remember that not everyone understands a certain language to the same extent as you do, so **be clear in your communications to be kind.**)
- Take breaks when you feel like you need them.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language. (Participants are encouraged to display their chosen pronouns on Zoom or in communication on Slack.)

## nf-core frowns on 😕

The following behaviours from any participants within the nf-core community (including the organisers) will be considered unacceptable under this code of conduct. Engaging or advocating for any of the following could result in expulsion from nf-core workspaces.

- Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following and sustained disruption of communication among participants of the community. This includes hijacking shared screens through actions such as using the annotate tool in conferencing software such as Zoom.
- “Doxing” i.e. posting (or threatening to post) another person’s personal identifying information online.
- Spamming or trolling of individuals on social media.
- Use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes and unwelcome sexual attention.
- Verbal and text comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or work experience.

### Online Trolling

The majority of nf-core interactions and events are held online. Unfortunately, holding events online comes with the added issue of online trolling. This is unacceptable, reports of such behaviour will be taken very seriously, and perpetrators will be excluded from activities immediately.

All community members are required to ask members of the group they are working within for explicit consent prior to taking screenshots of individuals during video calls.

## Procedures for Reporting CoC violations

If someone makes you feel uncomfortable through their behaviours or actions, report it as soon as possible.

You can reach out to members of the [nf-core core team](https://nf-co.re/about) and they will forward your concerns to the safety officer(s).

Issues directly concerning members of the core team will be dealt with by other members of the core team and the safety manager, and possible conflicts of interest will be taken into account. nf-core is also in discussions about having an ombudsperson, and details will be shared in due course.

All reports will be handled with utmost discretion and confidentially.

## Introduction

**nf-core/viralrecon** is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline used to perform assembly and intra-host/low-frequency variant calling for viral samples. The pipeline supports both Illumina and Nanopore sequencing data. For Illumina short-reads the pipeline is able to analyse metagenomics data typically obtained from shotgun sequencing (e.g. directly from clinical samples) and enrichment-based library preparation methods (e.g. amplicon-based: [ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 enrichment protocol](https://artic.network/ncov-2019); or probe-capture-based). For Nanopore data the pipeline only supports amplicon-based analysis obtained from primer sets created and maintained by the [ARTIC Network](https://artic.network/).

On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources. The results obtained from running the full-sized tests individually for each `--platform` option can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/results) and the output directories will be named accordingly i.e. `platform_illumina/` and `platform_nanopore/`.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!

## Pipeline summary

The pipeline has numerous options to allow you to run only specific aspects of the workflow if you so wish. For example, for Illumina data you can skip the host read filtering step with Kraken 2 with `--skip_kraken2` or you can skip all of the assembly steps with the `--skip_assembly` parameter. See the [usage](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/usage) and [parameter](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/parameters) docs for all of the available options when running the pipeline.

The SRA download functionality has been removed from the pipeline (`>=2.1`) and ported to an independent workflow called [nf-core/fetchngs](https://nf-co.re/fetchngs). You can provide `--nf_core_pipeline viralrecon` when running nf-core/fetchngs to download and auto-create a samplesheet containing publicly available samples that can be accepted directly by the Illumina processing mode of nf-core/viralrecon.

A number of improvements were made to the pipeline recently, mainly with regard to the variant calling. Please see [Major updates in v2.3](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/issues/271) for a more detailed description.

## Quick Start

1. Install [`Nextflow`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) (`>=21.10.3`)

2. Install any of [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/), [`Podman`](https://podman.io/), [`Shifter`](https://nersc.gitlab.io/development/shifter/how-to-use/) or [`Charliecloud`](https://hpc.github.io/charliecloud/) for full pipeline reproducibility *(please only use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles))*

3. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

    ```console
    nextflow run nf-core/viralrecon -profile test,YOURPROFILE --outdir <OUTDIR>
    ```

    Note that some form of configuration will be needed so that Nextflow knows how to fetch the required software. This is usually done in the form of a config profile (`YOURPROFILE` in the example command above). You can chain multiple config profiles in a comma-separated string.

    > * The pipeline comes with config profiles called `docker`, `singularity`, `podman`, `shifter`, `charliecloud` and `conda` which instruct the pipeline to use the named tool for software management. For example, `-profile test,docker`.
    > * Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.
    > * If you are using `singularity`, please use the [`nf-core download`](https://nf-co.re/tools/#downloading-pipelines-for-offline-use) command to download images first, before running the pipeline. Setting the [`NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` or `singularity.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/singularity.html?#singularity-docker-hub) Nextflow options enables you to store and re-use the images from a central location for future pipeline runs.
    > * If you are using `conda`, it is highly recommended to use the [`NXF_CONDA_CACHEDIR` or `conda.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/conda.html) settings to store the environments in a central location for future pipeline runs.

4. Start running your own analysis!

    * Typical command for Illumina shotgun analysis:

        ```bash
        nextflow run nf-core/viralrecon \
            --input samplesheet.csv \
            --outdir <OUTDIR> \
            --platform illumina \
            --protocol metagenomic \
            --genome 'MN908947.3' \
            -profile <docker/singularity/podman/conda/institute>
        ```

    * Typical command for Illumina amplicon analysis:

        ```bash
        nextflow run nf-core/viralrecon \
            --input samplesheet.csv \
            --outdir <OUTDIR> \
            --platform illumina \
            --protocol amplicon \
            --genome 'MN908947.3' \
            --primer_set artic \
            --primer_set_version 3 \
            --skip_assembly \
            -profile <docker/singularity/podman/conda/institute>
        ```

    * Typical command for Nanopore amplicon analysis:

        ```bash
        nextflow run nf-core/viralrecon \
            --input samplesheet.csv \
            --outdir <OUTDIR> \
            --platform nanopore \
            --genome 'MN908947.3' \
            --primer_set_version 3 \
            --fastq_dir fastq_pass/ \
            --fast5_dir fast5_pass/ \
            --sequencing_summary sequencing_summary.txt \
            -profile <docker/singularity/podman/conda/institute>
        ```

    * An executable Python script called [`fastq_dir_to_samplesheet.py`](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/blob/master/bin/fastq_dir_to_samplesheet.py) has been provided if you are using `--platform illumina` and would like to auto-create an input samplesheet based on a directory containing FastQ files **before** you run the pipeline (requires Python 3 installed locally) e.g.

        ```console
        wget -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/viralrecon/master/bin/fastq_dir_to_samplesheet.py
        ./fastq_dir_to_samplesheet.py <FASTQ_DIR> samplesheet.csv
        ```

    * You can find the default keys used to specify `--genome` in the [genomes config file](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/blob/master/conf/pipeline/viralrecon/genomes.config). This provides default options for
      * Reference genomes (including SARS-CoV-2)
      * Genome associates primer sets
      * [Nextclade datasets](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade/en/latest/user/datasets.html)

        The Pangolin and Nextclade lineage and clade definitions change regularly as new SARS-CoV-2 lineages are discovered. For instructions to use more recent versions of lineage analysis tools like Pangolin and Nextclade please refer to the [updating containers](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/usage#updating-containers) section in the usage docs.

       Where possible we are trying to collate links and settings for standard primer sets to make it easier to run the pipeline with standard keys; see [usage docs](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/usage#illumina-primer-sets).

## Documentation

The nf-core/viralrecon pipeline comes with documentation about the pipeline [usage](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/usage), [parameters](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/parameters) and [output](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/output).

## Credits

These scripts were originally written by [Sarai Varona](https://github.com/svarona), [Miguel Juliá](https://github.com/MiguelJulia), [Erika Kvalem](https://github.com/ErikaKvalem) and [Sara Monzon](https://github.com/saramonzon) from [BU-ISCIII](https://github.com/BU-ISCIII) and co-ordinated by Isabel Cuesta for the [Institute of Health Carlos III](https://eng.isciii.es/eng.isciii.es/Paginas/Inicio.html), Spain. Through collaboration with the nf-core community the pipeline has now been updated substantially to include additional processing steps, to standardise inputs/outputs and to improve pipeline reporting; implemented and maintained primarily by Harshil Patel ([@drpatelh](https://github.com/drpatelh)) from [Seqera Labs, Spain](https://seqera.io/).

The key steps in the Nanopore implementation of the pipeline are carried out using the [ARTIC Network's field bioinformatics pipeline](https://github.com/artic-network/fieldbioinformatics) and were inspired by the amazing work carried out by contributors to the [connor-lab/ncov2019-artic-nf pipeline](https://github.com/connor-lab/ncov2019-artic-nf) originally written by [Matt Bull](https://github.com/m-bull) for use by the [COG-UK](https://github.com/COG-UK) project. Thank you for all of your incredible efforts during this pandemic!

### Software dependencies

Note, since the pipeline is now using Nextflow DSL2, each process will be run with its own [Biocontainer](https://biocontainers.pro/#/registry). This means that on occasion it is entirely possible for the pipeline to be using different versions of the same tool. However, the overall software dependency changes compared to the last release have been listed below for reference.

### Software dependencies

Note, since the pipeline is now using Nextflow DSL2, each process will be run with its own [Biocontainer](https://biocontainers.pro/#/registry). This means that on occasion it is entirely possible for the pipeline to be using different versions of the same tool. However, the overall software dependency changes compared to the last release have been listed below for reference.

## [[1.0.0](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/releases/tag/1.0.0)] - 2020-06-01

Initial release of nf-core/viralrecon, created with the [nf-core](http://nf-co.re/) template.

This pipeline is a re-implementation of the [SARS_Cov2_consensus-nf](https://github.com/BU-ISCIII/SARS_Cov2_consensus-nf) and [SARS_Cov2_assembly-nf](https://github.com/BU-ISCIII/SARS_Cov2_assembly-nf) pipelines initially developed by [Sarai Varona](https://github.com/svarona) and [Sara Monzon](https://github.com/saramonzon) from [BU-ISCIII](https://github.com/BU-ISCIII). Porting both of these pipelines to nf-core was an international collaboration between numerous contributors and developers, led by [Harshil Patel](https://github.com/drpatelh) from the [The Bioinformatics & Biostatistics Group](https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/science-technology-platforms/bioinformatics-and-biostatistics/) at [The Francis Crick Institute](https://www.crick.ac.uk/), London. We appreciated the need to have a portable, reproducible and scalable pipeline for the analysis of COVID-19 sequencing samples and so the Avengers Assembled!

# nf-core/viralrecon: Contributing Guidelines

Hi there!
Many thanks for taking an interest in improving nf-core/viralrecon.

We try to manage the required tasks for nf-core/viralrecon using GitHub issues, you probably came to this page when creating one.
Please use the pre-filled template to save time.

However, don't be put off by this template - other more general issues and suggestions are welcome!
Contributions to the code are even more welcome ;)

> If you need help using or modifying nf-core/viralrecon then the best place to ask is on the nf-core Slack [#viralrecon](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/viralrecon) channel ([join our Slack here](https://nf-co.re/join/slack)).

## Contribution workflow

If you'd like to write some code for nf-core/viralrecon, the standard workflow is as follows:

1. Check that there isn't already an issue about your idea in the [nf-core/viralrecon issues](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/issues) to avoid duplicating work
    * If there isn't one already, please create one so that others know you're working on this
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the [nf-core/viralrecon repository](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon) to your GitHub account
3. Make the necessary changes / additions within your forked repository following [Pipeline conventions](#pipeline-contribution-conventions)
4. Use `nf-core schema build` and add any new parameters to the pipeline JSON schema (requires [nf-core tools](https://github.com/nf-core/tools) >= 1.10).
5. Submit a Pull Request against the `dev` branch and wait for the code to be reviewed and merged

If you're not used to this workflow with git, you can start with some [docs from GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests) or even their [excellent `git` resources](https://try.github.io/).

## Tests

When you create a pull request with changes, [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) will run automatic tests.
Typically, pull-requests are only fully reviewed when these tests are passing, though of course we can help out before then.

There are typically two types of tests that run:

### Lint tests

`nf-core` has a [set of guidelines](https://nf-co.re/developers/guidelines) which all pipelines must adhere to.
To enforce these and ensure that all pipelines stay in sync, we have developed a helper tool which runs checks on the pipeline code. This is in the [nf-core/tools repository](https://github.com/nf-core/tools) and once installed can be run locally with the `nf-core lint <pipeline-directory>` command.

If any failures or warnings are encountered, please follow the listed URL for more documentation.

### Pipeline tests

Each `nf-core` pipeline should be set up with a minimal set of test-data.
`GitHub Actions` then runs the pipeline on this data to ensure that it exits successfully.
If there are any failures then the automated tests fail.
These tests are run both with the latest available version of `Nextflow` and also the minimum required version that is stated in the pipeline code.

## Patch

:warning: Only in the unlikely and regretful event of a release happening with a bug.

* On your own fork, make a new branch `patch` based on `upstream/master`.
* Fix the bug, and bump version (X.Y.Z+1).
* A PR should be made on `master` from patch to directly this particular bug.

## Getting help

For further information/help, please consult the [nf-core/viralrecon documentation](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/usage) and don't hesitate to get in touch on the nf-core Slack [#viralrecon](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/viralrecon) channel ([join our Slack here](https://nf-co.re/join/slack)).

## Pipeline contribution conventions

To make the nf-core/viralrecon code and processing logic more understandable for new contributors and to ensure quality, we semi-standardise the way the code and other contributions are written.

### Adding a new step

If you wish to contribute a new step, please use the following coding standards:

1. Define the corresponding input channel into your new process from the expected previous process channel
2. Write the process block (see below).
3. Define the output channel if needed (see below).
4. Add any new parameters to `nextflow.config` with a default (see below).
5. Add any new parameters to `nextflow_schema.json` with help text (via the `nf-core schema build` tool).
6. Add sanity checks and validation for all relevant parameters.
7. Perform local tests to validate that the new code works as expected.
8. If applicable, add a new test command in `.github/workflow/ci.yml`.
9. Update MultiQC config `assets/multiqc_config.yaml` so relevant suffixes, file name clean up and module plots are in the appropriate order. If applicable, add a [MultiQC](https://https://multiqc.info/) module.
10. Add a description of the output files and if relevant any appropriate images from the MultiQC report to `docs/output.md`.

### Default values

Parameters should be initialised / defined with default values in `nextflow.config` under the `params` scope.

Once there, use `nf-core schema build` to add to `nextflow_schema.json`.

### Default processes resource requirements

Sensible defaults for process resource requirements (CPUs / memory / time) for a process should be defined in `conf/base.config`. These should generally be specified generic with `withLabel:` selectors so they can be shared across multiple processes/steps of the pipeline. A nf-core standard set of labels that should be followed where possible can be seen in the [nf-core pipeline template](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/blob/master/nf_core/pipeline-template/conf/base.config), which has the default process as a single core-process, and then different levels of multi-core configurations for increasingly large memory requirements defined with standardised labels.

The process resources can be passed on to the tool dynamically within the process with the `${task.cpu}` and `${task.memory}` variables in the `script:` block.

### Naming schemes

Please use the following naming schemes, to make it easy to understand what is going where.

* initial process channel: `ch_output_from_<process>`
* intermediate and terminal channels: `ch_<previousprocess>_for_<nextprocess>`

### Nextflow version bumping

If you are using a new feature from core Nextflow, you may bump the minimum required version of nextflow in the pipeline with: `nf-core bump-version --nextflow . [min-nf-version]`

### Images and figures

For overview images and other documents we follow the nf-core [style guidelines and examples](https://nf-co.re/developers/design_guidelines).
# nf-core/viralrecon: Usage

## :warning: Please read this documentation on the nf-core website: [https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/usage](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/usage)

> _Documentation of pipeline parameters is generated automatically from the pipeline schema and can no longer be found in markdown files._

## Samplesheet format

### Illumina

You will need to create a samplesheet with information about the samples you would like to analyse before running the pipeline. Use this parameter to specify its location. It has to be a comma-separated file with 3 columns, and a header row as shown in the examples below.

```console
--input '[path to samplesheet file]'
```

The `sample` identifiers have to be the same when you have re-sequenced the same sample more than once (e.g. to increase sequencing depth). The pipeline will concatenate the raw reads before performing any downstream analysis.

A final samplesheet file may look something like the one below. `SAMPLE_1` was sequenced twice in Illumina PE format, `SAMPLE_2` was sequenced once in Illumina SE format.

```console
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
SAMPLE_1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
SAMPLE_1,AEG588A1_S1_L003_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L003_R2_001.fastq.gz
SAMPLE_2,AEG588A2_S4_L003_R1_001.fastq.gz,
```

| Column    | Description                                                                                                                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sample`  | Custom sample name. This entry will be identical for multiple sequencing libraries/runs from the same sample.               |
| `fastq_1` | Full path to FastQ file for Illumina short reads 1. File has to be gzipped and have the extension ".fastq.gz" or ".fq.gz".  |
| `fastq_2` | Full path to FastQ file for Illumina short reads 2. File has to be gzipped and have the extension ".fastq.gz" or ".fq.gz".  |

> **NB:** Dashes (`-`) and spaces in sample names are automatically converted to underscores (`_`) to avoid downstream issues in the pipeline.

### Nanopore

You have the option to provide a samplesheet to the pipeline that maps sample ids to barcode ids. This allows you to associate barcode ids to clinical/public database identifiers that can be used to QC or pre-process the data with more appropriate sample names.

```console
--input '[path to samplesheet file]'
```

It has to be a comma-separated file with 2 columns. A final samplesheet file may look something like the one below:

```console
sample,barcode
21X983255,1
70H209408,2
49Y807476,3
70N209581,4
```

| Column    | Description                                                                                                                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sample`  | Custom sample name, one per barcode.                                                                                        |
| `barcode` | Barcode identifier attributed to that sample during multiplexing. Must be an integer.                                       |

> **NB:** Dashes (`-`) and spaces in sample names are automatically converted to underscores (`_`) to avoid downstream issues in the pipeline.

## Nanopore input format

For Nanopore data the pipeline only supports amplicon-based analysis obtained from primer sets created and maintained by the [ARTIC Network](https://artic.network/). The [artic minion](https://artic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/) tool from the [ARTIC field bioinformatics pipeline](https://github.com/artic-network/fieldbioinformatics) is used to align reads, call variants and to generate the consensus sequence.

### Nanopolish

The default variant caller used by artic minion is [Nanopolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish) and this requires that you provide `*.fastq`, `*.fast5` and `sequencing_summary.txt` files as input to the pipeline. These files can typically be obtained after demultiplexing and basecalling the sequencing data using [Guppy](https://nanoporetech.com/nanopore-sequencing-data-analysis) (see [ARTIC SOP docs](https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html)). This pipeline requires that the files are organised in the format outlined below and gzip compressed files are also accepted:

```console

The command to run the pipeline would then be:

```console
nextflow run nf-core/viralrecon \
    --input samplesheet.csv \
    --outdir <OUTDIR> \
    --platform nanopore \
    --genome 'MN908947.3' \
    --primer_set_version 3 \
    --fastq_dir fastq_pass/ \
    --fast5_dir fast5_pass/ \
    --sequencing_summary sequencing_summary.txt \
    -profile <docker/singularity/podman/conda/institute>
```

### Medaka

You also have the option of using [Medaka](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka) as an alternative variant caller to Nanopolish via the `--artic_minion_caller medaka` parameter. Medaka is faster than Nanopolish, performs mostly the same and can be run directly from `fastq` input files as opposed to requiring the `fastq`, `fast5` and `sequencing_summary.txt` files required to run Nanopolish. You must provide the appropriate [Medaka model](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka#models) via the `--artic_minion_medaka_model` parameter if using `--artic_minion_caller medaka`. The `fastq` files have to be organised in the same way as for Nanopolish as outlined in the section above.

The command to run the pipeline would then be:

```console
nextflow run nf-core/viralrecon \
    --input samplesheet.csv \
    --outdir <OUTDIR> \
    --platform nanopore \
    --genome 'MN908947.3' \
    --primer_set_version 3 \
    --fastq_dir fastq_pass/ \
    --artic_minion_caller medaka \
    --artic_minion_medaka_model r941_min_high_g360 \
    -profile <docker/singularity/podman/conda/institute>
```

## Illumina primer sets

The Illumina processing mode of the pipeline has been tested on numerous different primer sets. Where possible we are trying to collate links and settings for standard primer sets to make it easier to run the pipeline with standard parameter keys. If you are able to get permissions from the vendor/supplier to share the primer information then we would be more than happy to support it within the pipeline.

For SARS-CoV-2 data we recommend using the "MN908947.3" genome because it is supported out-of-the-box by the most commonly used primer sets available from the [ARTIC Network](https://artic.network/). For ease of use, we are also maintaining a version of the "MN908947.3" genome along with the appropriate links to the ARTIC primer sets in the [genomes config file](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/blob/master/conf/pipeline/viralrecon/genomes.config) used by the pipeline. The genomes config file can be updated independently from the main pipeline code to make it possible to dynamically extend this file for other viral genomes/primer sets on request.

For further information or help, don't hesitate to get in touch on the [Slack `#viralrecon` channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/viralrecon) (you can join with [this invite](https://nf-co.re/join/slack)).

### ARTIC primer sets

An example command using v3 ARTIC primers with "MN908947.3":

```console
nextflow run nf-core/viralrecon \
    --input samplesheet.csv \
    --outdir <OUTDIR> \
    --platform illumina \
    --protocol amplicon \
    --genome 'MN908947.3' \
    --primer_set artic \
    --primer_set_version 3 \
    --skip_assembly \
    -profile <docker/singularity/podman/conda/institute>
```

### SWIFT primer sets

The [SWIFT amplicon panel](https://swiftbiosci.com/swift-amplicon-sars-cov-2-panel/) is another commonly used method used to prep and sequence SARS-CoV-2 samples. We haven't been able to obtain explicit permission to host standard SWIFT primer sets but you can obtain a masterfile which is freely available from their website that contains the primer sequences as well as genomic co-ordinates. You just need to convert this file to [BED6](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1) format and provide it to the pipeline with `--primer_bed swift_primers.bed`. Be sure to check the values provided to `--primer_left_suffix` and `--primer_right_suffix` match the primer names defined in the BED file as highlighted in [this issue](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/issues/169). For an explanation behind the usage of the `--ivar_trim_offset 5` for SWIFT primer sets see [this issue](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/issues/170).

An example command using SWIFT primers with "MN908947.3":

```console
nextflow run nf-core/viralrecon \
    --input samplesheet.csv \
    --outdir <OUTDIR> \
    --platform illumina \
    --protocol amplicon \
    --genome 'MN908947.3' \
    --primer_bed swift_primers.bed \
    --primer_left_suffix '_F' \
    --primer_right_suffix '_R' \
    --ivar_trim_offset 5 \
    --skip_assembly \
    -profile <docker/singularity/podman/conda/institute>
```

## Running the pipeline

The typical command for running the pipeline is as follows:

```console
nextflow run nf-core/viralrecon --input samplesheet.csv --outdir <OUTDIR> --genome 'MN908947.3' -profile docker
```

This will launch the pipeline with the `docker` configuration profile. See below for more information about profiles.

Note that the pipeline will create the following files in your working directory:

```console
work            # Directory containing the nextflow working files
results         # Finished results (configurable, see below)
.nextflow_log   # Log file from Nextflow
# Other nextflow hidden files, eg. history of pipeline runs and old logs.
```

### Updating the pipeline

When you run the above command, Nextflow automatically pulls the pipeline code from GitHub and stores it as a cached version. When running the pipeline after this, it will always use the cached version if available - even if the pipeline has been updated since. To make sure that you're running the latest version of the pipeline, make sure that you regularly update the cached version of the pipeline:

```console
nextflow pull nf-core/viralrecon
```

### Reproducibility

It is a good idea to specify a pipeline version when running the pipeline on your data. This ensures that a specific version of the pipeline code and software are used when you run your pipeline. If you keep using the same tag, you'll be running the same version of the pipeline, even if there have been changes to the code since.

First, go to the [nf-core/viralrecon releases page](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/releases) and find the latest version number - numeric only (eg. `1.3.1`). Then specify this when running the pipeline with `-r` (one hyphen) - eg. `-r 1.3.1`.

This version number will be logged in reports when you run the pipeline, so that you'll know what you used when you look back in the future.

## Core Nextflow arguments

> **NB:** These options are part of Nextflow and use a _single_ hyphen (pipeline parameters use a double-hyphen).

### `-profile`

Use this parameter to choose a configuration profile. Profiles can give configuration presets for different compute environments.

Several generic profiles are bundled with the pipeline which instruct the pipeline to use software packaged using different methods (Docker, Singularity, Podman, Shifter, Charliecloud, Conda) - see below. When using Biocontainers, most of these software packaging methods pull Docker containers from quay.io e.g [FastQC](https://quay.io/repository/biocontainers/fastqc) except for Singularity which directly downloads Singularity images via https hosted by the [Galaxy project](https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/) and Conda which downloads and installs software locally from [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/).

> We highly recommend the use of Docker or Singularity containers for full pipeline reproducibility, however when this is not possible, Conda is also supported.

The pipeline also dynamically loads configurations from [https://github.com/nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs) when it runs, making multiple config profiles for various institutional clusters available at run time. For more information and to see if your system is available in these configs please see the [nf-core/configs documentation](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation).

Note that multiple profiles can be loaded, for example: `-profile test,docker` - the order of arguments is important!
They are loaded in sequence, so later profiles can overwrite earlier profiles.

If `-profile` is not specified, the pipeline will run locally and expect all software to be installed and available on the `PATH`. This is _not_ recommended.

* `docker`
    * A generic configuration profile to be used with [Docker](https://docker.com/)
* `singularity`
    * A generic configuration profile to be used with [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/)
* `podman`
    * A generic configuration profile to be used with [Podman](https://podman.io/)
* `shifter`
    * A generic configuration profile to be used with [Shifter](https://nersc.gitlab.io/development/shifter/how-to-use/)
* `charliecloud`
    * A generic configuration profile to be used with [Charliecloud](https://hpc.github.io/charliecloud/)
* `conda`
    * A generic configuration profile to be used with [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/). Please only use Conda as a last resort i.e. when it's not possible to run the pipeline with Docker, Singularity, Podman, Shifter or Charliecloud.
* `test`
    * A profile with a complete configuration for automated testing
    * Includes links to test data so needs no other parameters

### `-resume`

Specify this when restarting a pipeline. Nextflow will used cached results from any pipeline steps where the inputs are the same, continuing from where it got to previously.

You can also supply a run name to resume a specific run: `-resume [run-name]`. Use the `nextflow log` command to show previous run names.

### `-c`

Specify the path to a specific config file (this is a core Nextflow command). See the [nf-core website documentation](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration) for more information.

## Custom configuration

### Resource requests

Whilst the default requirements set within the pipeline will hopefully work for most people and with most input data, you may find that you want to customise the compute resources that the pipeline requests. Each step in the pipeline has a default set of requirements for number of CPUs, memory and time. For most of the steps in the pipeline, if the job exits with any of the error codes specified [here](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/4c27ef5610c87db00c3c5a3eed10b1d161abf575/conf/base.config#L18) it will automatically be resubmitted with higher requests (2 x original, then 3 x original). If it still fails after the third attempt then the pipeline execution is stopped.

For example, if the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline is failing after multiple re-submissions of the `STAR_ALIGN` process due to an exit code of `137` this would indicate that there is an out of memory issue:

```console
[62/149eb0] NOTE: Process `RNASEQ:ALIGN_STAR:STAR_ALIGN (WT_REP1)` terminated with an error exit status (137) -- Execution is retried (1)
Error executing process > 'RNASEQ:ALIGN_STAR:STAR_ALIGN (WT_REP1)'

Caused by:
    Process `RNASEQ:ALIGN_STAR:STAR_ALIGN (WT_REP1)` terminated with an error exit status (137)

Command executed:
    STAR \
        --genomeDir star \
        --readFilesIn WT_REP1_trimmed.fq.gz  \
        --runThreadN 2 \
        --outFileNamePrefix WT_REP1. \
        <TRUNCATED>

Command exit status:
    137

Command output:
    (empty)

Command error:
    .command.sh: line 9:  30 Killed    STAR --genomeDir star --readFilesIn WT_REP1_trimmed.fq.gz --runThreadN 2 --outFileNamePrefix WT_REP1. <TRUNCATED>
Work dir:
    /home/pipelinetest/work/9d/172ca5881234073e8d76f2a19c88fb

Tip: you can replicate the issue by changing to the process work dir and entering the command `bash .command.run`
```

To bypass this error you would need to find exactly which resources are set by the `STAR_ALIGN` process. The quickest way is to search for `process STAR_ALIGN` in the [nf-core/rnaseq Github repo](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/search?q=process+STAR_ALIGN).
We have standardised the structure of Nextflow DSL2 pipelines such that all module files will be present in the `modules/` directory and so based on the search results the file we want is `modules/nf-core/software/star/align/main.nf`.
If you click on the link to that file you will notice that there is a `label` directive at the top of the module that is set to [`label process_high`](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/4c27ef5610c87db00c3c5a3eed10b1d161abf575/modules/nf-core/software/star/align/main.nf#L9).
The [Nextflow `label`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#label) directive allows us to organise workflow processes in separate groups which can be referenced in a configuration file to select and configure subset of processes having similar computing requirements.
The default values for the `process_high` label are set in the pipeline's [`base.config`](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/4c27ef5610c87db00c3c5a3eed10b1d161abf575/conf/base.config#L33-L37) which in this case is defined as 72GB.
Providing you haven't set any other standard nf-core parameters to **cap** the [maximum resources](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#max-resources) used by the pipeline then we can try and bypass the `STAR_ALIGN` process failure by creating a custom config file that sets at least 72GB of memory, in this case increased to 100GB.
The custom config below can then be provided to the pipeline via the [`-c`](#-c) parameter as highlighted in previous sections.

```nextflow
process {
    withName: STAR_ALIGN {
        memory = 100.GB
    }
}
```

> **NB:** We specify just the process name i.e. `STAR_ALIGN` in the config file and not the full task name string that is printed to screen in the error message or on the terminal whilst the pipeline is running i.e. `RNASEQ:ALIGN_STAR:STAR_ALIGN`.
> You may get a warning suggesting that the process selector isn't recognised but you can ignore that if the process name has been specified correctly. This is something that needs to be fixed upstream in core Nextflow.

### Updating containers

The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. If for some reason you need to use a different version of a particular tool with the pipeline then you just need to identify the `process` name and override the Nextflow `container` definition for that process using the `withName` declaration.

#### Pangolin

For example, in the [nf-core/viralrecon](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon) pipeline a tool called [Pangolin](https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin) has been used during the COVID-19 pandemic to assign lineages to SARS-CoV-2 genome sequenced samples. Given that the lineage assignments change quite frequently it doesn't make sense to re-release the nf-core/viralrecon everytime a new version of Pangolin has been released. However, you can override the default container used by the pipeline by creating a custom config file and passing it as a command-line argument via `-c custom.config`.

1. Check the default version used by the pipeline in the module file for [Pangolin](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/blob/a85d5969f9025409e3618d6c280ef15ce417df65/modules/nf-core/software/pangolin/main.nf#L14-L19)
2. Find the latest version of the Biocontainer available on [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/biocontainers/pangolin?tag=latest&tab=tags)
3. Create the custom config accordingly:

    * For Docker:

        ```nextflow
        process {
            withName: PANGOLIN {
                container = 'quay.io/biocontainers/pangolin:3.1.17--pyhdfd78af_1'
            }
        }
        ```

    * For Singularity:

        ```nextflow
        process {
            withName: PANGOLIN {
                container = 'https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/pangolin:3.1.17--pyhdfd78af_1'
            }
        }
        ```

    * For Conda:

        ```nextflow
        process {
            withName: PANGOLIN {
                conda = 'bioconda::pangolin=3.1.17'
            }
        }
        ```

#### Nextclade

You can use a similar approach to update the version of Nextclade used by the pipeline:

1. Check the default version used by the pipeline in the module file for [Nextclade](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/blob/e582db9c70721aae530703ec9a2ab8b219c96a99/modules/nf-core/modules/nextclade/run/main.nf#L5-L8)
2. Find the latest version of the Biocontainer available on [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/biocontainers/nextclade?tag=latest&tab=tags)
3. Create the custom config accordingly:

    * For Docker:

        ```nextflow
        process {
            withName: 'NEXTCLADE_DATASETGET|NEXTCLADE_RUN' {
                container = 'quay.io/biocontainers/nextclade:1.10.1--h9ee0642_0'
            }
        }
        ```

    * For Singularity:

        ```nextflow
        process {
            withName: 'NEXTCLADE_DATASETGET|NEXTCLADE_RUN' {
                container = 'https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/nextclade:1.10.1--h9ee0642_0'
            }
        }
        ```

    * For Conda:

        ```nextflow
        process {
            withName: 'NEXTCLADE_DATASETGET|NEXTCLADE_RUN' {
                conda = 'bioconda::nextclade=1.10.1'
            }
        }
        ```

##### Nextclade datasets

A [`nextclade dataset`](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade/en/latest/user/datasets.html#nextclade-datasets) feature was introduced in [Nextclade CLI v1.3.0](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade/releases/tag/1.3.0) that fetches input genome files such as reference sequences and trees from a central dataset repository. We have uploaded Nextclade dataset [v2022-01-18](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade_data/releases/tag/2022-01-24--21-27-29--UTC) to [nf-core/test-datasets](https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/blob/viralrecon/genome/MN908947.3/nextclade_sars-cov-2_MN908947_2022-01-18T12_00_00Z.tar.gz?raw=true), and for reproducibility, this will be used by default if you specify `--genome 'MN908947.3'` when running the pipeline. However, there are a number of ways you can use a more recent version of the dataset:

* Supply your own by setting: `--nextclade_dataset <PATH_TO_DATASET>`
* Let the pipeline create and use the latest version by setting: `--nextclade_dataset false --nextclade_dataset_tag false`
* Let the pipeline create and use a specific, tagged version by setting: `--nextclade_dataset false --nextclade_dataset_tag <DATASET_TAG>`

The Nextclade dataset releases can be found on their [Github page](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade_data/releases). Use the tag specified for each release e.g `2022-01-18T12:00:00Z` in the example below:

![Nextclade tag example](images/nextclade_tag_example.png)

If the `--save_reference` parameter is provided then the Nextclade dataset generated by the pipeline will also be saved in the `results/genome/` directory.

> **NB:** If you wish to periodically update individual tool-specific results (e.g. Pangolin) generated by the pipeline then you must ensure to keep the `work/` directory otherwise the `-resume` ability of the pipeline will be compromised and it will restart from scratch.

### nf-core/configs

In most cases, you will only need to create a custom config as a one-off but if you and others within your organisation are likely to be running nf-core pipelines regularly and need to use the same settings regularly it may be a good idea to request that your custom config file is uploaded to the `nf-core/configs` git repository. Before you do this please can you test that the config file works with your pipeline of choice using the `-c` parameter. You can then create a pull request to the `nf-core/configs` repository with the addition of your config file, associated documentation file (see examples in [`nf-core/configs/docs`](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/tree/master/docs)), and amending [`nfcore_custom.config`](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/blob/master/nfcore_custom.config) to include your custom profile.

See the main [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html) for more information about creating your own configuration files.

If you have any questions or issues please send us a message on [Slack](https://nf-co.re/join/slack) on the [`#configs` channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/configs).

## Running in the background

Nextflow handles job submissions and supervises the running jobs. The Nextflow process must run until the pipeline is finished.

The Nextflow `-bg` flag launches Nextflow in the background, detached from your terminal so that the workflow does not stop if you log out of your session. The logs are saved to a file.

Alternatively, you can use `screen` / `tmux` or similar tool to create a detached session which you can log back into at a later time.
Some HPC setups also allow you to run nextflow within a cluster job submitted your job scheduler (from where it submits more jobs).

## Nextflow memory requirements

In some cases, the Nextflow Java virtual machines can start to request a large amount of memory.
We recommend adding the following line to your environment to limit this (typically in `~/.bashrc` or `~./bash_profile`):

```console
NXF_OPTS='-Xms1g -Xmx4g'
```

# Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

# Nanopore: Pipeline overview

* [Preprocessing](#nanopore-preprocessing)
    * [pycoQC](#nanopore-pycoqc) - Sequencing QC

* [Workflow reporting](#nanopore-workflow-reporting)
    * [MultiQC](#nanopore-multiqc) - Present QC, visualisation and custom reporting for sequencing, raw reads, alignment and variant calling results

## Nanopore: Preprocessing

A file called `summary_variants_metrics_mqc.csv` containing a selection of read alignment and variant calling metrics will be saved in the `multiqc/<CALLER>/` output directory which is determined by the `--artic_minion_caller` parameter (Default: `nanopolish/`). The same metrics will also be added to the top of the MultiQC report.

### Nanopore: pycoQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `pycoqc/`
    * `*.html` and `.json` file that includes a run summary and graphical representation of various QC metrics including distribution of read length, distribution of read quality scores, mean read quality per sequence length, output per channel over experiment time and percentage of reads per barcode.

</details>

[PycoQC](https://github.com/a-slide/pycoQC) compute metrics and generate QC plots using the sequencing summary information generated by basecalling/demultiplexing tools such as Guppy e.g. distribution of read length, read length over time, number of reads per barcode and other general stats.

<p align="center"><img src="images/pycoqc_readsperbarcode.png" alt="PycoQC - Number of reads per barcode" width="500"></p>

### Nanopore: artic guppyplex

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `guppyplex/`
    * `*.fastq.gz` files generated by aggregate pre-demultiplexed reads from MinKNOW/Guppy. These files are not saved by default but can be via a custom config file such as the one below.

```nextflow
params {
    modules {
        'nanopore_artic_guppyplex' {
            publish_files = ['fastq.gz':'']
        }
    }
}
```

</details>

The [artic guppyplex](https://artic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/) tool from the [ARTIC field bioinformatics pipeline](https://github.com/artic-network/fieldbioinformatics) is used to perform length filtering of the demultiplexed Nanopore reads obtained per barcode. This essentially filters out chimeric reads that may be generated by the ARTIC protocol. The pipeline uses a default minimum and maximum read length of 400 and 700, respectively as tailored for the [nCoV-2019 primer set](https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html). However, you may need to adjust these for different primer schemes e.g. by using the minimum length of the amplicons (`--min-length`) as well as the maximum length plus 200 (`--max-length`).

</details>

The [artic minion](https://artic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/) tool from the [ARTIC field bioinformatics pipeline](https://github.com/artic-network/fieldbioinformatics) is used to align reads, call variants and to generate the consensus sequence. By default, artic minion uses [Minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) to align the reads to the viral genome, however you can use [BWA](https://github.com/lh3/bwa) instead using the `--artic_minion_aligner bwa` parameter. Similarly, the default variant caller used by artic minion is [Nanopolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish), however, you can use [Medaka](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka) instead via the `--artic_minion_caller medaka` parameter. Medaka is faster than Nanopolish, performs mostly the same and can be run directly from `fastq` input files as opposed to requiring the `fastq`, `fast5` and `sequencing_summary.txt` files required to run Nanopolish. You must provide the appropriate [Medaka model](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka#models) via the `--artic_minion_medaka_model` parameter if using `--artic_minion_caller medaka`.

</details>

As described in the documentation, [ASCIIGenome](https://asciigenome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a command-line genome browser that can be run from a terminal window and is solely based on ASCII characters. The closest program to ASCIIGenome is probably [samtools tview](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-tview.html) but ASCIIGenome offers much more flexibility, similar to popular GUI viewers like the [IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/) browser. We are using the batch processing mode of ASCIIGenome in this pipeline to generate individual screenshots for all of the variant sites reported for each sample in the VCF files. This is incredibly useful to be able to quickly QC the variants called by the pipeline without having to tediously load all of the relevant tracks into a conventional genome browser. Where possible, the BAM read alignments, VCF variant file, primer BED file and GFF annotation track will be represented in the screenshot for contextual purposes. The screenshot below shows a SNP called relative to the MN908947.3 SARS-CoV-2 reference genome that overlaps the ORF7a protein and the nCoV-2019_91_LEFT primer from the ARIC v3 protocol.

![MultiQC - FastQC adapter content plot](images/mqc_fastqc_adapter.png)

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from pycoQC, samtools, mosdepth, BCFTools, SnpEff and QUAST.

The default [`multiqc config file`](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/blob/master/assets/multiqc_config_nanopore.yaml) has been written in a way in which to structure these QC metrics to make them more interpretable in the final report.

The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

An example MultiQC report generated from a full-sized dataset can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/results).

</details>

[Kraken 2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/index.shtml?t=manual) is a sequence classifier that assigns taxonomic labels to DNA sequences. Kraken 2 examines the k-mers within a query sequence and uses the information within those k-mers to query a database. That database maps k-mers to the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all genomes known to contain a given k-mer.

We use a Kraken 2 database in this workflow to filter out reads specific to the host genome before performing the *de novo* assembly steps in the pipeline. This filtering is not performed in the variant calling arm of the pipeline by default but Kraken 2 is still run to obtain an estimate of host reads, however, the filtering can be amended via the `--kraken2_variants_host_filter` parameter.

![MultiQC - Kraken 2 classification plot](images/mqc_kraken2_plot.png)

## Illumina: Variant calling

Unless you are using [UMIs](https://emea.illumina.com/science/sequencing-method-explorer/kits-and-arrays/umi.html) it is not possible to establish whether the fragments you have sequenced from your sample were derived via true biological duplication (i.e. sequencing independent template fragments) or as a result of PCR biases introduced during the library preparation. [picard MarkDuplicates](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037052812-MarkDuplicates-Picard-) isn't run by default because you anticipate high levels of duplication with viral data due to the size of the genome, however, you can activate it by adding `--skip_markduplicates false` to the command you use to run the pipeline. This will only *mark* the duplicate reads identified amongst the alignments to allow you to guage the overall level of duplication in your samples. You can also choose to remove any reads identified as duplicates via the `--filter_duplicates` parameter.

</details>

[iVar](https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar/blob/master/docs/MANUAL.md) is a computational package that contains functions broadly useful for viral amplicon-based sequencing. We use iVar in this pipeline to [trim primer sequences](#ivar-trim) for amplicon input data as well as to call variants.

iVar outputs a tsv format which is not compatible with downstream analysis such as annotation using SnpEff. Moreover some issues need to be addressed such as [strand-bias filtering](https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar/issues/5) and [the consecutive reporting of variants belonging to the same codon](https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar/issues/92). This pipeline uses a custom Python script [ivar_variants_to_vcf.py](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/blob/master/bin/ivar_variants_to_vcf.py) to convert the default iVar output to VCF whilst also addressing both of these issues.

</details>

As described in the documentation, [ASCIIGenome](https://asciigenome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a command-line genome browser that can be run from a terminal window and is solely based on ASCII characters. The closest program to ASCIIGenome is probably [samtools tview](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-tview.html) but ASCIIGenome offers much more flexibility, similar to popular GUI viewers like the [IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/) browser. We are using the batch processing mode of ASCIIGenome in this pipeline to generate individual screenshots for all of the variant sites reported for each sample in the VCF files. This is incredibly useful to be able to quickly QC the variants called by the pipeline without having to tediously load all of the relevant tracks into a conventional genome browser. Where possible, the BAM read alignments, VCF variant file, primer BED file and GFF annotation track will be represented in the screenshot for contextual purposes. The screenshot below shows a SNP called relative to the MN908947.3 SARS-CoV-2 reference genome that overlaps the ORF7a protein and the nCoV-2019_91_LEFT primer from the ARIC v3 protocol.

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `multiqc/`
    * `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
    * `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarizing all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from FastQC, fastp, Cutadapt, Bowtie 2, Kraken 2, samtools, picard CollectMultipleMetrics, BCFTools, SnpEff and QUAST.

The default [`multiqc config file`](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/blob/master/assets/multiqc_config_illumina.yaml) has been written in a way in which to structure these QC metrics to make them more interpretable in the final report.

The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

An example MultiQC report generated from a full-sized dataset can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/results).

A number of genome-specific files are generated by the pipeline because they are required for the downstream processing of the results. If the `--save_reference` parameter is provided then the Bowtie 2 alignment indices, BLAST and Kraken 2 databases downloaded/generated by the pipeline will be saved in the `genome/` directory. It is recommended to use the `--save_reference` parameter if you are using the pipeline to build a Kraken 2 database for the host genome. This can be quite a time-consuming process and it permits their reuse for future runs of the pipeline or for other purposes.
