## What is SPARClink?
### NIH SPARC
The NIH Common Fundâ€™s Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC) program aims to transform our understanding of nerve-organ interactions with the intent of advancing bioelectronic medicine towards treatments that change lives. [Learn more about SPARC](https://sparc.science/about)

### FAIR Data
By employing a [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) first approach SPARC datasets, protocols and publications generated via the SPARC program is intended to be able to be used by researchers globally with reproducible results. However, at the current moment, there is no real tangible way to show or visualize the usage of SPARC data in outside projects and publications. 

### Origin Story
The SPARClink project was first born as an idea at the 2021 NIH SPARC Codeathon ([more details here](https://sparc.science/help/2021-sparc-fair-codeathon)). The idea behind the topic was created as a method of visualizing citation data on datasets, protocols and publications to determine the degree of use of SPARC material outside of the official channels.

### Defining Impact
The word 'Impact' can have many different meanings depending on the context that it is viewed in. Within the SPARClink project, we consider impact to be the frequency of citations of SPARC funded resources. The SPARC program intends to advance medical understanding by providing datasets, maps and computational studies that follow FAIR principles and is used by researchers all around the world. The usage of SPARC resouces by platforms and programs ouside SPARC is what we view as the meaning of the term 'Impact'.

### Goal
The goal of SPARClink is to provide a system that will query all external publications using open source tools and platforms and create an interactable visualization that is helpful to any person (researcher or otherwise) to showcase the impact that SPARC has on the overall scientific research community. These impact measurements are meant to be used as a showcase of the concept of FAIR data and how good data generation practices and methods are useful in advancing the field of bioelectronic medicine.

However, datasets and protocols are not referenced similar to prior research in manuscripts. Dataset and protocol identifiers or urls are only mentioned in text or under supplementary materials, making this a difficult task to accomplish.

## How it works?
Metadata information on datasets and protocols are extracted from [Pennsieve](https://app.pennsieve.io/), SPARC Airtable database, and [Protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/sparc). This information is queried against the [NIH RePORTER](https://api.reporter.nih.gov/), [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), and [Google Scholar](https://serpapi.com/google-scholar-api) to extract citations and create a well connected graph using [d3.js](https://d3js.org/).

  <span> SPARClink workflow </span>
</p>

## Run the project
Clone or download the repository.
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/SPARClink.git
```

The development environment uses [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to keep track of the python dependencies. Download Anaconda here: [Anaconda Individual Edition](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

The following would create a new `conda` environment with the dependencies required to run the project.
``` bash
cd SPARClink
conda env create -f environment.yml --prefix ./env 
conda activate ./env
```
The application uses [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) to load configuration information from a `.env` file. Create a `.env` file with the following information.
``` bash
PROTOCOLS_IO_KEY="<protocols.io api key>"
SERPAPI_KEY="<serpapi api key>"
```
A public API key for protocols.io can be obtained by signing up as [shown here](https://www.protocols.io/developers). SERP api key is not required at the moment. To integrate google scholar results, an API key can be obtained as [shown here](https://serpapi.com/).

### Testing
Unit tests to verify external APIs are written in Python unittest framework. The tests can be run as shown below:
``` bash
python -m unittest -v tests/test_NIH_NCBI.py
```

### Firebase Backend Implementation
Currently, the central database is implemented as a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) real-time database. The database can be updated by running `FirebaseImplementation.py`. However, this requires a username and a password.

To use your own Firebase instance, setup a Firebase web app as [shown here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup), and update `firebaseConfig` in `FirebaseImplementation.py` with the new API keys. [Setup a new user](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/password-auth), and configure the [real-time database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start). It is recommended to limit the database write permission to authenticated users. Run `FireabaseImplementation.py` and enter user's email/password when prompted.

</p>

### ML Data Indexing Engine
We have setup a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) server on [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) to handle all our machine learning operations. If you would like to setup a backend for your own fork, please setup a flask server on any hosting service of your choice and modify the approriate endpoints in the `flask_app.py` file. To learn more about the techniques we used, refer to the [Further Reading](https://github.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/SPARClink#further-reading) section. 

### Visualization Web App
The vizualizations created from the realtime database can be viewed directly from our [demo page](https://sparclink-f151d.web.app/sparclink) or by running the local version of our frontend. We use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to render the demo webpage. The interactive force directed graph is created via [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) using data requested from our Firebase real-time database. Within the SPARClink demo page we use the HTML canvas element to render the visualization. In order to get your forked repo frontend to run locally, use the following commands:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run serve
```
You can now open your browser and visit the url [http://localhost:8080/sparclink](http://localhost:8080/sparclink) to view the webpage. 


`Note:` To use the smart word filter, please refer to the frontend available in the [`smart_filter`](https://github.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/SPARClink/tree/smart_filter/frontend) branch. This feature will lead to slower render times on the graph visualization so we have not included it in the main branch.

## Requesting data from the real-time database
SPARClink uses a Firebase real-time database as its intermediary data storage server. This allows for the backend citation extraction system to reside in a separate server and allow the frontend to pull data asynchronously. If you prefer another data storage mechanism please add and modify the appropriate end point in the SPARClink component found in the `frontend/src/components/SparcLink/SparcLink.vue` file. The url endpoint for the GET request can be found in the `organizeData` function in the `methods` section. Our backend systems only allows authenticated users to write to the database so you will need to refer to the appropriate User ID when referencing the object.

## Adjusting the physics of the visualization
[d3.js](https://d3js.org/) provides extensive documentation on the physics that we implement on our visualizations. If you would like to modify how the graph behaves, the best place to start is at the force simulations in the `drawCanvas` function. d3.js also provides the option of rendering graphs in SVG elements but the limit of nodes that a simulation can accept, before there is a considerable performance drop, is low.
```javascript
this.simulation = d3
  .forceSimulation(nodes)
  .force(
    "link",
    d3.forceLink(links).id((d) => d.id)
  )
  .force("x", d3.forceX())
  .force("y", d3.forceY())
  .force("charge", d3.forceManyBody().strength(this.strength))
  .force("center", d3.forceCenter(WIDTH / 2, HEIGHT / 2));
```
You may define your own forces to act on the nodes or use d3's default forces. Please be aware that the canvas itself has a limit on the amount of nodes that can be drawn in its context before performance takes a hit. Within our own testing 8,000 to 10,000 nodes is the limit of acceptable performance. If your database is larger than this amount, please see if you can filter out any nodes that are present in the data.

## Adjusting the wordcloud
The [d3-cloud](https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud) library is used to generate the visualizations. To modify the rendered image, edit the lines of code below. The data for the function is returned from the backend api found [here](https://github.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/SPARClink/blob/main/MLDataIndexingEngine/README.md#word-cloud).
```javascript
var layout = cloud()
  .size([300,300])
  .words(
    keywords.map(function (d, i) {
      return { text: d, size: 10 + values[i] * 90 };
    })
  )
  .padding(5)
  .rotate(0)
  .font("Asap, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif")
  .fontSize(function (d) {
    return d.size;
  })
  .on("end", draw);
```
# ML Data Indexing Engine

This module is used to run additional analytics on the search terms for a more smarter SPARClink experience. There are three submodules in this section that references the three key features that are used by SPARClink.

The machine learning engine provides smart search features to the end user of our demo portal. This module also contains algorithms that learn vector embeddings of the descriptors of the elements present in the SPARClink database. Based on these vector embeddings the algorithms compute the similarity between the vectors representation of each word in the vocabulary with the vector representing the whole dataset and finds keywords that would describe the resource. We show these keywords based on their relevance in our word cloud. We have multiple options for searching for keywords in our codebase each providing a different level of performance in terms of time complexity and explainability. We use the [Symspell](https://github.com/wolfgarbe/symspell) algorithm trained on the dataset present in the scikit learn package as well as the vocabulary built using SPARClink database. We use delete-only edit candidate generation for generating different combinations of spelling errors and use both character level embedding and word embedding for recommending the most probable correct spelling. The output of the spell correction algorithm is used to generate sentence level embedding and is then compared with the embeddings of different discriptors of the items in the dataset. We obtain a ranking of all the items in the dataset based on their similarity with the searched string. The top 10 are chosen to be shown on the frontend. 

## Keyword Extraction
This module is used to generate keyword using keyBERT pretrained model. It generates top 50 key words associated with the whole document. It also make use of Maximal marginal relevence algorithm to pick key words that have higher distance among them. This is to ensure diversity among the chosen key words.

## SPARC Search
This module is primarily used for the Top 10 recommended related items in the bottom left panel. Filter keywords are passed to the function via a https request and the server will return a list of most relevant publications, protocols and datasets. The second query parameter is used for the smart filter feature that can be found in the [`smart_filter`](https://github.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/SPARClink/tree/smart_filter) branch. A list of what we think is the right word is returned in the response.

```javascript
var axios = require('axios');
var data = JSON.stringify({
  "inputString": "Identification of peripheral neural cercuit",
  "fullModel": false,
  "recommendation": true
});

var config = {
  method: 'post',
  url: 'https://megasanjay.pythonanywhere.com/sparcsearch',
  headers: { 
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  data : data
};

axios(config)
.then(function (response) {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
})
.catch(function (error) {
  console.log(error);
});

```

## Word Cloud
This module is used to generate a list of keywords for the word map visualization that is shown in the left control panel. The api receives a list of sentences and  analyzes the content before suggesting the list of best keywords ranked in descending order. On the front end we use the top 20 terms returned to generate the interactive wordcloud. 

```javascript
var axios = require('axios');
var data = JSON.stringify({
  "sentences": [
    "Annotated heart scaffold for pig available for registration of segmented neural anatomical-functional mapping of cardiac neural circuits.",
    "Data from the innervation of intact mice hearts and the mapping of parasympathetic and sympathetic neural circuits which control heart rate. This data set identifies the cholinergic and noradrenergic neurons which project to the sinoatrial node."
  ]
});

var config = {
  method: 'post',
  url: 'https://megasanjay.pythonanywhere.com/wordcloud',
  headers: { 
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  data : data
};

axios(config)
.then(function (response) {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
})
.catch(function (error) {
  console.log(error);
});
```
# Keyword Extractor

Description - 
Uses keyBERT to perform key word extraction. This code uses maximal marginal relevance to change the diversity among the keywords.
`main(number of keywords)` takes `int` argument signifying numbe of keywords and return a dictionary in json format where `key` are keywords and `value` are importance factor.

## Requirements
```
!pip install keybert[all]
```
## Demo:
Top 60 key words generated by keeping ```mmr = .3``` within the keyBERT function.

# Word Cloud
This module uses frequency of occurrence for all words present in the vocabulary and ranks them based on their frequency. It also provides a method that takes in these words and their frequencies to generate word cloud in the shape of the image `sparc_lung.jpg`. Higher the frequency larger the size of the word in the word cloud.
 
 ## Demo

## Description:
This is a recommendation system that was built with the aim to make searching for documents using keywords simpler and user friendly. The two mechanisms used in this module are explained below. 

First is a word recommendation or spelling recommendation which takes a given string looks for the most probable word in the vocabulary. 

The second part uses the spelling recommendation to look for publications and datasets present in the Firebase real-time daatabase to get most relatable articles with respect to the search terms. This is based on a word embedding generated using a word2vec model. GloVe is an unsupervised algorithm that attempts to obtain high-dimensional vector representations of words using global word-word co-occurrence. This has been shown to encode interesting semantic information and to encode semantically related words nearby one another. (the code also provides option of using GloVe embedding). 

Word2vec model generates a vocabulary and vector representation for each article based on their title and description. When a string is serched its vector representation is generated and the cosine similarity between that vector and the vector representation of each article title/description is measured.

We pick the top 10 of these to show on the frontend.

## Requirement:
To run this function standalone follow the instructions below. These commands are already handled if you are using the SPARClink conda environment.
```python
!python -m nltk.downloader stopwords
!python -m pip install -U symspellpy
!pip install --upgrade gensim
```

## Steps for usage:
The main function takes three inputs: 
1. `string`: This parameter takes in a string. The output from the search bar goes here.
2. `full_model`: If 'True' then uses Glove model. (Read below for further instructions)
3. `recommendation`: If `True` then use the word2vec model to return the article recomendation system.


```python
SparcSearch(string, full_model = False, recomendation = True)
```


Returns the publication and dataset ids in order of relevance to search field (empty list in case of `recommendation = False`) and spelling recommendation.
1. To switch off the recommendation system for papers set `recommendation` to `False`. This will then only run the spelling recommendation. 

2. If `recommendation = True` the code will perform spelling recommendation followed by paper recommendation.

3. To train the model using the Glove dataset :
   1. Download https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip 
   2. `!unzip glove.6B.zip`
   3. `get_glove2wv()`
   4. Set `full_model` to True

3. To run the code only on the words and tags associated with the dataset keep full model = Flase


## Demo:
```
python Sparcsearch.py "neoral cercuit" False True
```

        'description': 'Experiments to map physiological functions of autonomic nerves and the continued advance of bioelectronictherapies are limited by inadequate activation or block of targeted nerve fibers and unwanted co-activation orblock of non-targeted nerve fibers. More fundamentally, the relationship between applied stimuli and the nervefibers that are activated or blocked, how this relationship varies across individuals and species, and how theserelationships can be controlled remain largely unknown. We will develop, implement and validate an efficientcomputational pipeline for simulation of electrical activation and block of different nerve fiber types withinautonomic nerves. The pipeline will include segmentation of microanatomy from fixed nerve samples, three-dimensional finite-element models of electrodes positioned on nerves, and non-linear cable models of differentnerve fiber types, enabling calculation of quantitative input-output maps of activation and block of specific nervefibers. As key benchmarks of pipeline development and for the proposed analysis and design efforts, we willimplement models of the cervical (VNc) and abdominal (VNa) vagus nerves in rat, in a SPARC-identified animalmodel, and in human. The VNc is an excellent test bed as it contains a broad spectrum of nerve fiber types,there are experimental data to facilitate model validation, and there are multiple applications of VNc stimulationwhere a lack of fiber selectivity limits the therapeutic window. The VNa is an excellent complement to the cervicalVNc, as a prototypical autonomic nerve of a size comparable to many of the small autonomic nerves targetedby SPARC projects. We will use the models that emerge from the pipeline to achieve analysis and design goalsto address critical gaps identified as SPARC priorities. Specifically, we will quantify of the effects of intra-speciesdifferences in nerve morphology on activation and block by building individual sample-specific models for eachnerve and specie. These models will also be used to quantify inter-species differences in nerve fiber activationand block and to identify electrode designs and stimulation parameters that produce equivalent degrees ofactivation and block across species. We will combine the resulting models with engineering optimization todesign approaches to increase the selectivity and efficiency of activation and block of different nerve fiber types.The outcomes will be a pipeline for modeling autonomic nerves, electrode geometries, and stimulationparameters, as well as tools that address the limitations of nerve stimulation selectivity and efficiency that hinderthe continued advance of physiological mapping studies and the development of bioelectronic therapies.',
