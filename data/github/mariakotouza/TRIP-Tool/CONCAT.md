# T-cell Receptor/Immunoglobulin Profiler (TRIP)

TRIP is a software framework that provides analytics services on NGS Data, implemented in [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).

## Update Feb 2021

For the latest version of the tool, please follow the link available through the [bio.tools registry entry](https://bio.tools/TRIP_-_T-cell_Receptor_Immunoglobulin_Profiler), as this repository is not being actively maintained.


## Installation

#### R Shiny packages

```
install.packages(c("shiny","shinyFiles", "shinyjs", "shinyBS"))
```

#### Other packages for data processing and visualization

```
install.packages(c("DT","plyr","dplyr","pryr","data.table","stringr","tidyr","xtable","plot3D","gridExtra","stringdist","plotly","parallel"))
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("Biostrings")
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R") 
biocLite("motifStack")
```

##  Run the Application

- You can run the application by pressing the **"Run App"** button, from either **ui.R** or **server.R** script.
- The Datasets you want to process together must be contained into a folder organised into sub-folders. The Data folder contains some sample datasets.
- All the datasets that you select to process together must have the same column names (attributes).
- In order to successfully run the pipeline, you need to run the preselection and selection steps first. In the case that you do not want to filter out any rows from the dataset, you just have to press the Apply and Execute buttons at the Preselection and Selection panels accordingly, before continuing with the pipeline steps. The information at the Visualization and the Overview tabs will become available when the execution of the pipeline is completed. You will get a corresponding message for each step that you have selected (e.g. "Clonotypes run!") when this happens. 
- If you want to use only those attributes of the tables that are necessary to run the pipeline, you need to set the variable use_only_useful_columns equal to True, otherwise you set it equal to False. You can see those attributes in the param/ used_columns.csv and param/ used_columns_only_useful.csv files accordingly. 


You may find a detailed documentation of the TRIP tool at [Wiki](https://github.com/mariakotouza/TRIP-Tool/wiki/Antigen-receptor-gene-profiler-(TRIP)). 

##  Run TRIP as an R script-based tool 
In order to run TRIP as a script-based tool, except from the packages that are described above, the user need to install the optparse package.

```
install.packages("optparse") 
```

There are two ways to run the script-based tool:
- Through R Studio: run the **make_options.R** file, after first changing/editing the default values for the parameters that are in the **option_list** in the file. The working directory should be the path where the file **make_options.R** is.
- Through the command line: run the command **Rscript --vanilla make_options.R** followed by a list of the parameters you need to change from the default values. For example, in order to run only the 1st & 2nd pipeline choice, the command should look like this:

```
Rscript --vanilla make_options.R --pipeline 1,2 
```

To run a pipeline that computed the highly similar clonotypes, the user should insert the number of mismatches by setting the --highly_sim_params option, using dashes and spaces as follows:

"6-1 7-1 8-1 9-2 12-2,1,Yes"   (i.e. for cdr3 length = **6** - number of mismatches = **1**, for cdr3 length = **7** - number of mismatches = **1**, etc. ) 

In this case, the command should look like this:

```
Rscript --vanilla make_options.R --pipeline 1,2,3 --highly_sim_params 6-1 7-1 8-1 9-2 12-2,1,Yes
```

All the available and the deafault parameters are available in the **make_options.R** files. The user can ask for help using the following command:
```
Rscript --vanilla make_options.R --help
```

##  Run TRIP as a Docker container
The Dockerfile and the configurations needed for building the TRIP docker image are available in the *docker* folder.

The docker image of TRIP is available on DockerHub throught the following link:
