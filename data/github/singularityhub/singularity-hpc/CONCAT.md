Singularity HPC is optimized for managing containers in an HPC environment. Currently, this includes
module technologies:

 - [Lmod](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
 - [Environment Modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net/)

And container technologies:

 - [Singularity](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity)
 - [Podman](https://podman.io)
 - [Docker](https://docker.io)


You can use shpc if you are:

1. a linux administrator wanting to manage containers as modules for your cluster
2. a cluster user that wants to maintain your own folder of custom modules
3. a cluster user that simply wants to pull Singularity images as GitHub packages.

A module technology is required in all cases.

# Summary

Portability and reproducibility of complex software stacks is essential for researchers to perform their work. High Performance Computing (HPC) environments add another level of complexity, where possibly conflicting dependencies must co-exist. Although container technologies like Singularity [@Kurtzer2017-xj] make it possible to "bring your own environment," without any form of central strategy to manage containers, researchers who seek reproducibility via using containers are tasked with managing their own container collection, often not taking care to ensure that a particular digest or version is used. The reproducibility of the work is at risk, as they cannot easily install and use containers, nor can they share their software with others.

Singularity Registry HPC (shpc) is the first of its kind to provide an easy means for a researcher to add their research software for sharing and collaboration with other researchers to an existing collection of over 200 popular scientific libraries [@da2017biocontainers; @noauthor_undated-kp, @gorgolewski2017bids; @gamblin2015spack; @autamus]. The software installs containers as environment modules [@McLay2011-wu] that are easy to use and read documentation for, and exposes aliases for commands in the container that the researcher can add to their pipeline without thinking about complex interactions with a container. The simple addition of an entry to the registry maintained by shpc comes down to adding a yaml file, and after doing this, another researcher can easily install the same software, down to the digest, to reproduce the original work.


## Statement of Need

Using environment modules [@McLay2011-wu] on HPC clusters is common.
Although writing the recipes can be complex, it's a fairly common practice for cluster administrators to provide
a set of natively installed recipes for their users [@noauthor_undated-bt], or for researchers to develop and deploy their own software via containers. Even well-known package managers like Spack [@noauthor_undated-ae] and EasyBuild [@noauthor_undated-dj] expose software as modules. However, these package manager approaches don't always ensure reproducibility, or ease of development for the researcher. They typically require relying on some subset of system software, the underlying operating system, or even making changes to the system, which is not under the researcher's control. Although using containers in this context has been discussed previously [@noauthor_undated-rj; @noauthor_undated-rc], the majority of these approaches and tools do not make the process of developing and installing container modules easy. The single researcher must either convince a cluster administrator to install dependencies needed for their software, or build a container and manually move and interact with it on the cluster. All of these small challenges come together to make it harder for a researcher to develop and manage their own software, and subsequently to share their approach to reproduce the work. Using Singularity, Podman, or other container technologies installed via Singularity Registry HPC offers a solution to this challenge. The only requirement is the container technology software, and writing a simple configuration file for the registry. By clearly defining commands, and pinning exact versions of scientific software, researchers on high performance computing
clusters can have more confidence in the reproducibility of their work [@Santana-Perez2015-wo; @Boettiger2014-cz; @Wandell2015-yt].

## Usage

Installing shpc is as easy as cloning the repository and installing in place:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-hpc
$ cd singularity-hpc
$ pip install -e .
```

While the defaults are suitable for most, the researcher can customize the location
of registry metadata files, the module directory to which modules are installed, and the directory to which containers are installed.
The user can then use `shpc show` to see readily available recipes, or browse the [library](https://singularityhub.github.io/singularity-hpc/) for an easily searchable interface. Installation comes down to installing a chosen module, loading it, and using it:

```bash
$ shpc install biocontainers/samtools
$ module load biocontainers/samtools
$ samtools
```

The samtools command would be an alias for a much more complicated command that the researcher
would not need to remember, including global options, command options, the full path
to the container, and the path to the executable inside the container. The container
pulled would also be a specific digest, making it easier to reproduce the researcher's workflow.
Finally, although containers typically only provide one entrypoint, there is no limit
to the number of aliases that can be exposed for easy usage.


## Collaborative Registry for Reproducible Science

Creating a registry entry for a scientific container comes down to writing 
a simple `container.yaml` file with basic metadata and description,
the definition of any and all important entrypoints, and the digests to pull.
As soon as a researcher puts their container in an online registry and adds the
entry, new versions of the container are automatically discovered by shpc,
and can be installed by the researcher when they choose.
The user does not need to look in advance for a version if they want the latest provided
by the registry. Software is easy to search for, and with a simple command, the user can quickly see complete
documentation and commands available:

```bash
$ module spider samtools
```

Every module includes a help section with a description, 
a complete list of commands that map to interactions with the container,
and a list of environment variables also available. 
The module system also provides command line completion, so the user can
use tabs to autocomplete the module names. Along with the expected commands to
use the container primary software (e.g., samtools) commands to shell, 
the software automatically generates alias to inspect, run, shell, or inspect 
container metadata. E.g., here is the shell command:

```bash
$ samtools-shell
```

Another compelling example is using a notebook provided by Jupyter Stacks [@cook2017opinionated]. 
Running notebooks that can be exposed via networking ports tends to be very complicated.
A full interaction might look like the following:

```bash
# pull the latest container, a moving target
$ singularity pull docker://jupyter/minimal-notebook

$ singularity exec --home ${HOME} --bind ${HOME}/.local:/home/joyvan/.local \
   minimal-notebook_latest.sif \
   jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=12345 --ip 0.0.0.0
```

With Singularity Registry HPC, the interaction to run the notebook can be figured
out and written down once, and provided as a community recipe. In this case, it's
exposed as the command "run-notebook":

```bash
$ run-notebook
```

which automatically selects a random port, binds the expected directories, and 
starts the notebook. The registry recipes are collaborative in nature because anyone
can open a pull request with a new recipe, or request a container be added by opening
an issue. Automation also ensures that adding and testing new containers, or working on the
code base is easy. Once a container is added, no further work is needed to update
versions for it. By way of a GitHub bot [@noauthor_undated-eh], both the latest version and newly available tags are 
updated automatically, following any filters that the recipe creator has provided for which tags should be added. Finally, on merge to the main branch, the documentation and library are also automatically updated.

## Conclusion

Singularity Registry HPC is the first local container registry that supports
reproducibility, easy of use, and portability of research software.
You can read more about it on the GitHub repository (https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-hpc) or
the main documentation site (https://singularity-hpc.readthedocs.io).

```

You can use tab for auto-completion of module names or commands that are provided.

<br>

### Commands

When you install this module, you'll be able to load it to make the following commands accessible.
Examples for both Singularity, Podman, and Docker (container technologies supported) are included.

#### {|module_name|}-run:

```bash
$ singularity run {% if bindpaths %}-B {{ bindpaths }} {% endif %}<container>
$ podman run --rm {% if bindpaths %}-v {{ bindpaths }} {% endif %} -v ${PWD} -w ${PWD} <container>
$ docker run --rm {% if bindpaths %}-v {{ bindpaths }} {% endif %} -v ${PWD} -w ${PWD} <container>
```

#### {|module_name|}-shell:

```bash
$ singularity shell -s {{ shell }} {% if bindpaths %}-B {{ bindpaths }} {% endif %}<container>
$ podman run --it --rm --entrypoint {{ shell }} {% if bindpaths %}-v {{ bindpaths }} {% endif %} -v ${PWD} -w ${PWD} <container>
$ docker run --it --rm --entrypoint {{ shell }} {% if bindpaths %}-v {{ bindpaths }} {% endif %} -v ${PWD} -w ${PWD} <container>
```

#### {|module_name|}-exec:

```bash
$ singularity exec -s {{ shell }} {% if bindpaths %}-B {{ bindpaths }} {% endif %}<container> "$@"
$ podman run --it --rm --entrypoint "" {% if bindpaths %}-v {{ bindpaths }} {% endif %} -v ${PWD} -w ${PWD} <container> "$@"
$ docker run --it --rm --entrypoint "" {% if bindpaths %}-v {{ bindpaths }} {% endif %} -v ${PWD} -w ${PWD} <container> "$@"
```

#### {|module_name|}-inspect:

Podman and Docker only have one inspect type.

```bash
$ podman inspect <container>
$ docker inspect <container>
```

#### {|module_name|}-inspect-runscript:

```bash
$ singularity inspect -r <container>
```

#### {|module_name|}-inspect-deffile:

```bash
$ singularity inspect -d <container>
```

{% if aliases %}{% for alias in aliases %}
#### {{ alias.name }}
       
```bash
$ singularity exec {% if bindpaths %}-B {{ bindpaths }} {% endif %}{% if alias.options %}{{ alias.options }} {% endif %}<container> {{ alias.command }}
$ podman run --it --rm --entrypoint {{ alias.entrypoint }} {% if bindpaths %}-v {{ bindpaths }} {% endif %} {% if alias.options %}{{ alias.options }} {% endif %} -v ${PWD} -w ${PWD} <container> -c "{{ alias.args }} $@"
$ docker run --it --rm --entrypoint {{ alias.entrypoint }} {% if bindpaths %}-v {{ bindpaths }} {% endif %} {% if alias.options %}{{ alias.options }} {% endif %} -v ${PWD} -w ${PWD} <container> -c "{{ alias.args }} $@"
```

{% endfor %}{% else %}

#### {|module_name|}

```bash
$ singularity run {% if bindpaths %}-B {{ bindpaths }}{% endif %}<container>
$ podman run --rm {% if bindpaths %}-v {{ bindpaths }}{% endif %} -v ${PWD} -w ${PWD} <container>
$ docker run --rm {% if bindpaths %}-v {{ bindpaths }}{% endif %} -v ${PWD} -w ${PWD} <container>
```
{% endif %}

In the above, the `<container>` directive will reference an actual container provided
by the module, for the version you have chosen to load. An environment file in the
module folder will also be bound. Note that although a container
might provide custom commands, every container exposes unique exec, shell, run, and
inspect aliases. For anycommands above, you can export:

 - SINGULARITY_OPTS: to define custom options for singularity (e.g., --debug)
 - SINGULARITY_COMMAND_OPTS: to define custom options for the command (e.g., -b)
 - PODMAN_OPTS: to define custom options for podman or docker
 - PODMAN_COMMAND_OPTS: to define custom options for the command

<br>
