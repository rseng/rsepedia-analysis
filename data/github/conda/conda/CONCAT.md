[//]: # (current developments)

## 4.11.0 (2021-11-22)

### Enhancements

* Allow channel_alias to interpolate environment variables.
* Support running conda with PyPy on Windows.
* Add ability to add, append and prepend to sequence values when using the conda config subcommand.
* Support Python 3.10 in version parser.
* Add `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` to the conda search path following the [XDG Base Directory Specification (XDGBDS)](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html).

### Bug fixes

* Fix the PowerShell activator to not show an error when unsetting environment variables.
* Remove superfluous `eval` statements in fish shell integration.
* Indent the conda fish integration file using fish_indent.
* Fix handling of environment variables containing equal signs (`=`).
* Handle permission errors when listing all known prefixes.
* Catch Unicode decoding errors when parsing conda-meta files.
* Fix handling write errors when trying to create package cache or env directories.

### Docs

* Update path of conda repo in RHEL based systems to `/etc/yum.repos.d/conda.repo`.
* Fix the advanced pip example to stop using the now invalid `file:` prefix.
* Minor docs cleanup and adding Code of Conduct.
* Add auto-built architecture documentation for conda based on the [C4 Model](https://c4model.com). See the conda documentation for more information.
* Expand the contributing documentation with a section about static code analysis and code linting.
* Add [developer guide section](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/dev-guide/) to the documentation, including a conda [architecture overview](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/architecture.html).
* Stop referring to updating anaconda when `conda update` fails with an error.

### Other

* Build Docker images periodically on GitHub Actions for the continuous integration testing on Linux, storing them on GitHub Packages's registry for reduced latency and cost when using Docker Hub.

* Simplify the Linux GitHub actions workflows by combining used shell scripts.
* Add periodic GitHub Actions workflow to review old issues in the conda issue tracker and mark them as stale if no feedback is provided in a sensible amount of time, eventually closing them.
* Add periodic GitHub Actions workflow to lock the comment threads of old issues and pull requests in the conda GitHub repository to surface regressions with new issues instead.
* Refactor test suite to use more GitHub Actions runners in parallel, reducing total run time by 50%.
* Switched the issue tracker to use forms with additional questions for bug reporters to help in ticket triage.
* Add and automatically run pre-commit as part of the CI system to improve the code quality continuously and raise issues in contributed patches early on.

  The used code linters are: [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/), [pylint](https://pylint.org/) and [bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/).

  The [Python code formatter black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) is used as well but is only enforced on changed code in a commit and not to the whole code base at once.
* Automatically build the conda package upon the successful merge into the master branch and upload it to the conda-canary channel on anaconda.org.

  To try conda out simply run:

  ```
  conda install -c conda-canary/label/dev conda
  ```
* Automate adding new issues to [public GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/conda/projects/4) to facilitate issue triage.

* Update GitHub issue and pull request labels to be more consistent.
* Start using [rever](https://regro.github.io/rever-docs/) for release management.
* (preview) Enable one-click gitpod and GitHub Codespaces setup for Linux development.

## 4.7.3 (2019-06-14)

### Bug fixes

* target prefix overrid applies to entry points in addition to replacements in standard files  (#8769)
* Revert to solver-based unsatisfiability determination  (#8775)
* fix renaming of existing prompt function in powershell  (#8774)

## 4.7.2 (2019-06-10)

### Behavior changes

* unsatisfiability is determined in a slightly different way now. It no longer
  uses the SAT solver, but rather determines whether any specs have no
  candidates at all after running through get_reduced_index. This has been
  faster in benchmarks, but we welcome further data from your use cases about
  whether this was a good change.  (#8741)
* when using the --only-deps flag for the `install` command, conda now
  explicitly records those specs in your history. This primarily serves to
  reduce conda accidentally removing packages that you have actually requested.  (#8766)

### Improvements

* UnsatisfiableError messages are now grouped into categories and explained a bit better.  (#8741)
* --repodata-fn argument can be passed multiple times to have more fallback
  paths. `repodata_fns` conda config setting does the same thing, but saves you
  from needing to do it for every command invocation.  (#8741)

### Bug fixes

* fix channel flip-flopping that was happening when adding a channel other than earlier ones  (#8741)
* refactor flow control for multiple repodata files to not use exceptions  (#8741)
* force conda to use only old .tar.bz2 files if conda-build <3.18.3 is
  installed. Conda-build breaks when inspecting file contents, and this is fixed
  in conda-build 3.18.3 (#8741)
* use --force when using rsync to improve behavior with folders that may exist
  in the destination somehow. (#8750)
* handle EPERM errors when renaming, because MacOS lets you remove or create
  files, but not rename them. Thanks Apple. (#8755)
* fix conda removing packages installed via `install` with --only-deps flag when
  either `update` or `remove` commands are run. See behavior changes above.

## 4.7.1 (2019-05-30)

### Improvements

* Base initial solver specs map on explicitly requested specs (new and historic)  (#8689)
* Improve anonymization of automatic error reporting  (#8715)
* Add option to keep using .tar.bz2 files, in case new .conda isn't working for whatever reason  (#8723)

### Bug fixes

* fix parsing hyphenated PyPI specs (change hyphens in versions to .)  (#8688)
* fix PrefixRecord creation when file inputs are .conda files  (#8689)
* fix PrefixRecord creation for pip-installed packages  (#8689)
* fix progress bar stopping at 75% (no extract progress with new libarchive)  (#8689)
* preserve pre-4.7 download() interface in conda.exports  (#8698)
* virtual packages (such as cuda) are represented by leading double underscores
  by convention, to avoid confusion with existing single underscore packages
  that serve other purposes (#8738)

### Deprecations/Breaking Changes

* The `--prune` flag no longer does anything. Pruning is implicitly the
  standard behavior now as a result of the initial solver specs coming from
  explicitly requested specs. Conda will remove packages that are not explicitly
  requested and are not required directly or indirectly by any explicitly
  installed package.

### Docs improvements

* Document removal of the `free` channel from defaults (#8682)
* Add reference to conda config --describe  (#8712)
* Add a tutorial for .condarc modification  (#8737)

### New Feature Highlights
* A new flag, '--envs', has been added to 'conda search'. In this mode,
  'conda search' will look for the package query in existing conda environments
  on your system. If ran as UID 0 (i.e. root) on unix systems or as an
  Administrator user on Windows, all known conda environments for all users
  on the system will be searched.  For example, 'conda search --envs openssl'
  will show the openssl version and environment location for all
  conda-installed openssl packages.

### Recommended change to enable conda in your shell

With the release of conda 4.4, we recommend a change to how the `conda` command is made available to your shell environment. All the old methods still work as before, but you'll need the new method to enable the new `conda activate` and `conda deactivate` commands.

For the "Anaconda Prompt" on Windows, there is no change.

For Bourne shell derivatives (bash, zsh, dash, etc.), you likely currently have a line similar to

    export PATH="/opt/conda/bin:$PATH"

in your `~/.bashrc` file (or `~/.bash_profile` file on macOS).  The effect of this line is that your base environment is put on PATH, but without actually *activating* that environment. (In 4.4 we've renamed the 'root' environment to the 'base' environment.) With conda 4.4, we recommend removing the line where the `PATH` environment variable is modified, and replacing it with

    . /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
    conda activate base

In the above, it's assumed that `/opt/conda` is the location where you installed miniconda or Anaconda.  It may also be something like `~/Anaconda3` or `~/miniconda2`.

For system-wide conda installs, to make the `conda` command available to all users, rather than manipulating individual `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.bash_profile`) files for each user, just execute once

    $ sudo ln -s /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh /etc/profile.d/conda.sh

This will make the `conda` command itself available to all users, but conda's base (root) environment will *not* be activated by default.  Users will still need to run `conda activate base` to put the base environment on PATH and gain access to the executables in the base environment.

After updating to conda 4.4, we also recommend pinning conda to a specific channel.  For example, executing the command

    $ conda config --system --add pinned_packages conda-canary::conda

will make sure that whenever conda is installed or changed in an environment, the source of the package is always being pulled from the `conda-canary` channel.  This will be useful for people who use `conda-forge`, to prevent conda from flipping back and forth between 4.3 and 4.4.


### New Feature Highlights

* **conda activate**: The logic and mechanisms underlying environment activation have been reworked. With conda 4.4, `conda activate` and `conda deactivate` are now the preferred commands for activating and deactivating environments. You'll find they are much more snappy than the `source activate` and `source deactivate` commands from previous conda versions. The `conda activate` command also has advantages of (1) being universal across all OSes, shells, and platforms, and (2) not having path collisions with scripts from other packages like python virtualenv's activate script.


* **constrained, optional dependencies**: Conda now allows a package to constrain versions of other packages installed alongside it, even if those constrained packages are not themselves hard dependencies for that package. In other words, it lets a package specify that, if another package ends up being installed into an environment, it must at least conform to a certain version specification. In effect, constrained dependencies are a type of "reverse" dependency. It gives a tool to a parent package to exclude other packages from an environment that might otherwise want to depend on it.

  Constrained optional dependencies are supported starting with conda-build 3.0 (via [conda/conda-build#2001[(https://github.com/conda/conda-build/pull/2001)). A new `run_constrained` keyword, which takes a list of package specs similar to the `run` keyword, is recognized under the `requirements` section of `meta.yaml`. For backward compatibility with versions of conda older than 4.4, a requirement may be listed in both the `run` and the `run_constrained` section. In that case older versions of conda will see the package as a hard dependency, while conda 4.4 will understand that the package is meant to be optional.

  Optional, constrained dependencies end up in `repodata.json` under a `constrains` keyword, parallel to the `depends` keyword for a package's hard dependencies.


* **enhanced package query language**: Conda has a built-in query language for searching for and matching packages, what we often refer to as `MatchSpec`. The MatchSpec is what users input on the command line when they specify packages for `create`, `install`, `update`, and `remove` operations. With this release, MatchSpec (rather than a regex) becomes the default input for `conda search`. We have also substantially enhanced our MatchSpec query language.

  For example,

      conda install conda-forge::python

  is now a valid command, which specifies that regardless of the active list of channel priorities, the python package itself should come from the `conda-forge` channel. As before, the difference between `python=3.5` and `python==3.5` is that the first contains a "*fuzzy*" version while the second contains an *exact* version. The fuzzy spec will match all python packages with versions `>=3.5` and `<3.6`. The exact spec will match only python packages with version `3.5`, `3.5.0`, `3.5.0.0`, etc. The canonical string form for a MatchSpec is thus

      (channel::)name(version(build_string))

  which should feel natural to experienced conda users. Specifications however are often necessarily more complicated than this simple form can support, and for these situations we've extended the specification to include an optional square bracket `[]` component containing comma-separated key-value pairs to allow matching on most any field contained in a package's metadata. Take, for example,

      conda search 'conda-forge/linux-64::*[md5=e42a03f799131d5af4196ce31a1084a7]' --info

  which results in information for the single package

  ```
  cytoolz 0.8.2 py35_0
  --------------------
  file name   : cytoolz-0.8.2-py35_0.tar.bz2
  name        : cytoolz
  version     : 0.8.2
  build string: py35_0
  build number: 0
  size        : 1.1 MB
  arch        : x86_64
  platform    : Platform.linux
  license     : BSD 3-Clause
  subdir      : linux-64
  url         : https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/cytoolz-0.8.2-py35_0.tar.bz2
  md5         : e42a03f799131d5af4196ce31a1084a7
  dependencies:
    - python 3.5*
    - toolz >=0.8.0
  ```

  The square bracket notation can also be used for any field that we match on outside the package name, and will override information given in the "simple form" position. To give a contrived example, `python==3.5[version='>=2.7,<2.8']` will match `2.7.*` versions and not `3.5`.


* **environments track user-requested state**: Building on our enhanced MatchSpec query language, conda environments now also track and differentiate (a) packages added to an environment because of an explicit user request from (b) packages brought into an environment to satisfy dependencies. For example, executing

      conda install conda-forge::scikit-learn

  will confine all future changes to the scikit-learn package in the environment to the conda-forge channel, until the spec is changed again. A subsequent command `conda install scikit-learn=0.18` would drop the `conda-forge` channel restriction from the package. And in this case, scikit-learn is the only user-defined spec, so the solver chooses dependencies from all configured channels and all available versions.


* **errors posted to core maintainers**: In previous versions of conda, unexpected errors resulted in a request for users to consider posting the error as a new issue on conda's github issue tracker. In conda 4.4, we've implemented a system for users to opt-in to sending that same error report via an HTTP POST request directly to the core maintainers.

  When an unexpected error is encountered, users are prompted with the error report followed by a `[y/N]` input. Users can elect to send the report, with 'no' being the default response. Users can also permanently opt-in or opt-out, thereby skipping the prompt altogether, using the boolean `report_errors` configuration parameter.


* **various UI improvements**: To push through some of the big leaps with transactions in conda 4.3, we accepted some regressions on progress bars and other user interface features. All of those indicators of progress, and more, have been brought back and further improved.


* **aggressive updates**: Conda now supports an `aggressive_update_packages` configuration parameter that holds a sequence of MatchSpec strings, in addition to the `pinned_packages` configuration parameter. Currently, the default value contains the packages `ca-certificates`, `certifi`, and `openssl`. When manipulating configuration with the `conda config` command, use of the `--system` and `--env` flags will be especially helpful here. For example,

      conda config --add aggressive_update_packages defaults::pyopenssl --system

  would ensure that, system-wide, solves on all environments enforce using the latest version of `pyopenssl` from the `defaults` channel.

      conda config --add pinned_packages python=2.7 --env

  would lock all solves for the current active environment to python versions matching `2.7.*`.


* **other configuration improvements**: In addition to `conda config --describe`, which shows detailed descriptions and default values for all available configuration parameters, we have a new `conda config --write-default` command. This new command simply writes the contents of `conda config --describe` to a condarc file, which is a great starter template. Without additional arguments, the command will write to the `.condarc` file in the user's home directory. The command also works with the `--system`, `--env`, and `--file` flags to write the contents to alternate locations.

  Conda exposes a tremendous amount of flexibility via configuration. For more information, [The Conda Configuration Engine for Power Users](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer-blog/conda-configuration-engine-power-users) blog post is a good resource.

## 4.3.0 (2016-12-14)  Safety

### New Features
* **Unlink and Link Packages in a Single Transaction**: In the past, conda hasn't always been safe
  and defensive with its disk-mutating actions. It has gleefully clobbered existing files, and
  mid-operation failures leave environments completely broken. In some of the most severe examples,
  conda can appear to "uninstall itself." With this release, the unlinking and linking of packages
  for an executed command is done in a single transaction. If a failure occurs for any reason
  while conda is mutating files on disk, the environment will be returned its previous state.
  While we've implemented some pre-transaction checks (verifying package integrity for example),
  it's impossible to anticipate every failure mechanism. In some circumstances, OS file
  permissions cannot be fully known until an operation is attempted and fails. And conda itself
  is not without bugs. Moving forward, unforeseeable failures won't be catastrophic. (#3833, #4030)

* **Progressive Fetch and Extract Transactions**: Like package unlinking and linking, the
  download and extract phases of package handling have also been given transaction-like behavior.
  The distinction is the rollback on error is limited to a single package. Rather than rolling back
  the download and extract operation for all packages, the single-package rollback prevents the
  need for having to re-download every package if an error is encountered. (#4021, #4030)

* **Generic- and Python-Type Noarch/Universal Packages**: Along with conda-build 2.1.0, a
  noarch/universal type for python packages is officially supported. These are much like universal
  python wheels. Files in a python noarch package are linked into a prefix just like any other
  conda package, with the following additional features
  1. conda maps the `site-packages` directory to the correct location for the python version
     in the environment,
  2. conda maps the python-scripts directory to either $PREFIX/bin or $PREFIX/Scripts depending
     on platform,
  3. conda creates the python entry points specified in the conda-build recipe, and
  4. conda compiles pyc files at install time when prefix write permissions are guaranteed.

  Python noarch packages must be "fully universal."  They cannot have OS- or
  python version-specific dependencies.  They cannot have OS- or python version-specific "scripts"
  files. If these features are needed, traditional conda packages must be used. (#3712)

* **Multi-User Package Caches**: While the on-disk package cache structure has been preserved,
  the core logic implementing package cache handling has had a complete overhaul.  Writable and
  read-only package caches are fully supported. (#4021)

* **Python API Module**: An oft requested feature is the ability to use conda as a python library,
  obviating the need to "shell out" to another python process. Conda 4.3 includes a
  `conda.cli.python_api` module that facilitates this use case. While we maintain the user-facing
  command-line interface, conda commands can be executed in-process. There is also a
  `conda.exports` module to facilitate longer-term usage of conda as a library across conda
  conda releases.  However, conda's python code *is* considered internal and private, subject
  to change at any time across releases. At the moment, conda will not install itself into
  environments other than its original install environment. (#4028)

* **Remove All Locks**:  Locking has never been fully effective in conda, and it often created a
  false sense of security. In this release, multi-user package cache support has been
  implemented for improved safety by hard-linking packages in read-only caches to the user's
  primary user package cache. Still, users are cautioned that undefined behavior can result when
  conda is running in multiple process and operating on the same package caches and/or
  environments. (#3862)

### Deprecations/Breaking Changes
* Conda will refuse to clobber existing files that are not within the unlink instructions of
  the transaction. At the risk of being user-hostile, it's a step forward for conda. We do
  anticipate some growing pains. For example, conda will not clobber packages that have been
  installed with pip (or any other package manager). In other instances, conda packages that
  contain overlapping file paths but are from different package families will not install at
  the same time. The `--force` command line flag is the escape hatch. Using `--force` will
  let your operation proceed, but also makes clear that you want conda to do something it
  considers unsafe.
* Conda signed packages have been removed in 4.3. Vulnerabilities existed. An illusion of security
  is worse than not having the feature at all.  We will be incorporating The Update Framework
  into conda in a future feature release. (#4064)
* Conda 4.4 will drop support for older versions of conda-build.

## 4.2.0 (2016-07-28)  Configuration

### New Features
* **New Configuration Engine**: Configuration and "operating context" are the foundation of
  conda's functionality. Conda now has the ability to pull configuration information from a
  multitude of on-disk locations, including `.d` directories and a `.condarc` file *within*
  a conda environment), along with full `CONDA_` environment variable support. Helpful
  validation errors are given for improperly-specified configuration. Full documentation
  updates pending. (#2537, #3160, #3178)
* **New Exception Handling Engine**: Previous releases followed a pattern of premature exiting
  (with hard calls to `sys.exit()` when exceptional circumstances were encountered. This
  release replaces over 100 `sys.exit` calls with python exceptions.  For conda developers,
  this will result in tests that are easier to write.  For developers using conda, this is a
  first step on a long path toward conda being directly importable.  For conda users, this will
  eventually result in more helpful and descriptive errors messages.
  (#2899, #2993, #3016, #3152, #3045)
* **Empty Environments**: Conda can now create "empty" environments when no initial packages
  are specified, alleviating a common source of confusion. (#3072, #3174)
* **Conda in Private Env**: Conda can now be configured to live within its own private
  environment.  While it's not yet default behavior, this represents a first step toward
  separating the `root` environment into a "conda private" environment and a "user default"
  environment. (#3068)
* **Regex Version Specification**: Regular expressions are now valid version specifiers.
  For example, `^1\.[5-8]\.1$|2.2`. (#2933)

  involving feature conflicts should be resolved.
* `conda update <package>` now handles depedencies properly
  according to the setting of the "update_deps" configuration:
      --update-deps: conda will also update any dependencies as needed
                     to install the latest verison of the requrested
                     packages.  The minimal set of changes required to
                     achieve this is sought.
      --no-update-deps: conda will update the packages *only* to the
                     extent that no updates to the dependencies are
                     required
  The previous behavior, which would update the packages without regard to
  their dependencies, could result in a broken configuration, and has been
  removed.

  * add support for the no_proxy environment variable, #1171
  * add a much faster hint generation for unsatisfiable packages, which is now
    always enabled (previously it would not run if there were more than ten
    specs). The new hint only gives one set of conflicting packages, rather
    than all sets, so multiple passes may be necessary to fix such issues
  * conda extensions that import conda should use
    conda.cli.conda_argparser.ArgumentParser instead of
    argparse.ArgumentParser to conform to the conda help guidelines (e.g., all
    help messages should be capitalized with periods, and the options should
    be preceded by "Options:" for the sake of help2man).

    assume that the dependencies are installed)
  * add --copy flag to install
  * prevent the progressbar from crashing conda when fetching in some
    situations


## 3.7.3 (2014-11-05)

  * conda install from a local conda package (or a tar fill which
    contains conda packages), will now also install the dependencies
    listed by the installed packages.

    Windows
  * retain Unix style path separators for prefixes in has_prefix on
    Windows (if the placeholder path uses /, replace it with a path that uses
    /, not \)
  * fix bug in --use-local due to API changes in conda-build
  * include user site directories in conda info -s
  * make binary has_prefix replacement work with spaces after the prefix
  * make binary has_prefix replacement replace multiple occurrences of the
    placeholder in the same null-terminated string
  * don't show packages from other platforms as installed or cached in conda
    search
  * be more careful about not warning about conda itself in pscheck
  * Use a progress bar for the unsatisfiable packages hint generation
  * Don't use TemporaryFile in try_write, as it is too slow when it fails
  * Ignore InsecureRequestWarning when ssl_verify is False
  * conda remove removes features tracked by removed packages in
    track_features


## 3.6.2 (2014-08-20)

    1.0alpha that are not directly recognized by verlib's NormalizedVersion
    are supported better
  * conda run command, to run apps and commands from packages
  * more complete --json API. Every conda command should fully support --json

  * add --alt-hint as a method to get an alternate form of a hint for
    unsatisfiable packages
  * add conda package --ls-files to list files in a package
  * add ability to pin specs in an environment. To pin a spec, add a file
    called pinned to the environment's conda-meta directory with the specs to
    pin. Pinned specs are always kept installed, unless the --no-pin flag is
    used.
  * fix keyboard interrupting of external commands. Now keyboard interupting
    conda build correctly removes the lock file
  * add no_link ability to conda, see issue #678


## 3.4.1 (2014-04-07)

  * always use a pkgs cache directory associated with an envs directory, even
    when using -p option with an arbitrary a prefix which is not inside an
    envs dir
  * add setting of PYTHONHOME to conda info --system
  * skip packages with bad metadata


## 3.4.0 (2014-04-02)

      - conda list --revisions
      - conda install --revision
      - log is stored in conda-meta/history

    line arguments, e.g. conda install 'numpy>=1.7', issue #624
  * fix error message for --file option when file does not exist
  * allow DEFAULTS in CONDA_ENVS_PATH, which expands to the defaults settings,
    including the condarc file

    environment)
  * add ability to show channel URLs when displaying what is going to be
    downloaded by setting "show_channel_urls: True" in condarc

    by ',' for example: >=2.3,<3.0
  * add ability to disable self update of conda, by setting
    "self_update: False" in .condarc
  * Try installing packages using the old way of just installing the maximum
    versions of things first. This provides a major speedup of solving the
    package specifications in the cases where this scheme works.
  * Don't include python=3.3 in the specs automatically for the Python 3
    version of conda.  This allows you to do "conda create -n env package" for
    a package that only has a Python 2 version without specifying
    "python=2". This change has no effect in Python 2.
  * Automatically put symlinks to conda, activate, and deactivate in each
    environment on Unix.
  * On Unix, activate and deactivate now remove the root environment from the
    PATH. This should prevent "bleed through" issues with commands not
    installed in the activated environment but that are installed in the root
    environment. If you have "setup.py develop" installed conda on Unix, you
    should run this command again, as the activate and deactivate scripts have
    changed.
  * Begin work to support Python 3.4.
  * Fix a bug in version comparison
  * Fix usage of sys.stdout and sys.stderr in environments like pythonw on
    Windows where they are nonstandard file descriptors.

  * print dots to the screen for progress
  * move logic functions from resolve to logic module


## 3.2.0a1 (2014-03-07)

  * conda now uses pseudo-boolean constraints in the SAT solver. This allows
    it to search for all versions at once, rather than only the latest (issue
    #491).
  * Conda contains a brand new logic submodule for converting pseudo-boolean
    constraints into SAT clauses.


## 3.1.1 (2014-03-07)

  * check if directory exists, fixed issue #591


## 3.1.0 (2014-03-07)

  * local packages in cache are now added to the index, this may be disabled
    by using the --known option, which only makes conda use index metadata
    from the known remote channels
  * add --use-index-cache option to enable using cache of channel index files
  * fix ownership of files when installing as root on Linux
  * conda search: add '.' symbol for extracted (cached) packages


## 3.0.6 (2014-02-20)

  * fix 'conda update' taking build number into account


## 3.0.5 (2014-02-17)

## 3.0.4 (2014-02-14)

  * conda update: don't try to update packages that are already up-to-date


## 3.0.3 (2014-02-06)

  * improve the speed of clean --lock
  * some fixes to conda config
  * more tests added
  * choose the first solution rather than the last when there are more than
    one, since this is more likely to be the one you want.


## 3.0.2 (2014-02-03)

  * fix detection of prefix being writable


## 3.0.1 (2014-01-31)

  * bug: not having track_features in condarc now uses default again
  * improved test suite
  * remove numpy version being treated special in plan module
  * if the post-link.(bat|sh) fails, don't treat it as though it installed,
    i.e. it is not added to conda-meta
  * fix activate if CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV is invalid
  * fix conda config --get to work with list keys again
  * print the total download size
  * fix a bug that was preventing conda from working in Python 3
  * add ability to run pre-link script, issue #548


## 3.0.0 (2014-01-24)

  * removed build, convert, index, and skeleton commands, which are now
    part of the conda-build project: https://github.com/conda/conda-build
  * limited pip integration to `conda list`, that means
    `conda install` no longer calls `pip install` # !!!
  * add ability to call sub-commands named 'conda-x'
  * The -c flag to conda search is now shorthand for --channel, not
    --canonical (this is to be consistent with other conda commands)
  * allow changing location of .condarc file using the CONDARC environment
    variable
  * conda search now shows the channel that the package comes from
  * conda search has a new --platform flag for searching for packages in other
    platforms.
  * remove condarc warnings: issue #526#issuecomment-33195012


## 2.3.1 (2014-01-17)

  * add ability create info/no_softlink
  * add conda convert command to convert non-platform-dependent packages from
    one platform to another (experimental)
  * unify create, install, and update code. This adds many features to create
    and update that were previously only available to install. A backwards
    incompatible change is that conda create -f now means --force, not
    --file.


## 2.3.0 (2014-01-16)

  * automatically prepend http://conda.binstar.org/ (or the value of
    channel_alias in the .condarc file) to channels whenever the
    channel is not a URL or the word 'defaults or 'system'
  * recipes made with the skeleton pypi command will use setuptools instead of
    distribute
  * re-work the setuptools dependency and entry_point logic so that
    non console_script entry_points for packages with a dependency on
    setuptools will get correct build script with conda skeleton pypi
  * add -m, --mkdir option to conda install
  * add ability to disable soft-linking

  * conda config: automatically add the 'defaults' channel
  * conda build: improve error handling for invalid recipe directory
  * add ability to set build string, issue #425

  * add support for execution with the -m switch (issue #398), i.e. you
    can execute conda also as: python -m conda
  * add a deactivate script for windows
  * conda build adds .pth-file when it encounters an egg (TODO)
  * add ability to preserve egg directory when building using
        build/preserve_egg_dir: True

  * fix prefix being replaced by placeholder after conda build on Unix
  * add 'use_pip' to condarc configuration file
  * fixed activate on Windows to set CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV
  * allow setting "always_yes: True" in condarc file, which implies always
    using the --yes option whenever asked to proceed


## 2.1.0 (2013-11-07)

  * fix rm_egg_dirs so that the .egg_info file can be a zip file
  * improve integration with pip
      * conda list now shows pip installed packages
      * conda install will try to install via "pip install" if no
        conda package is available (unless --no-pip is provided)
      * conda build has a new --build-recipe option which
        will create a recipe (stored in <root>/conda-recipes) from pypi
        then build a conda package (and install it)
      * pip list and pip install only happen if pip is installed
  * enhance the locking mechanism so that conda can call itself in the same
    process.

## Code of Conduct

The conda organization adheres to the [NumFOCUS Code of Conduct](https://www.numfocus.org/code-of-conduct).

## Development Environment

0. [Signup for a GitHub account][github signup] (if you haven't already) and
   [install Git on your system][install git].
1. Fork the conda repository to your personal GitHub account by clicking the
   "Fork" button on https://github.com/conda/conda and follow GitHub's
   instructions.
2. Clone the repo you just forked on GitHub to your local machine. Configure
   your repo to point to both "upstream" (the main conda repo) and your fork
   ("origin"). For detailed directions, see below:

   **Bash (macOS, Linux, Windows)**

   ```bash
   # choose the repository location
   # warning: not the location of an existing conda installation!
   $ CONDA_PROJECT_ROOT="$HOME/conda"

   # clone the project
   # replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username
   $ git clone git@github.com:your-username/conda "$CONDA_PROJECT_ROOT"
   $ cd "$CONDA_PROJECT_ROOT"

   # set the `upstream` as the the main repository
   $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:conda/conda
   ```

   **cmd.exe (Windows)**

   ```batch
   # choose the repository location
   # warning: not the location of an existing conda installation!
   > set "CONDA_PROJECT_ROOT=%HOMEPATH%\conda"

   # clone the project
   # replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username
   > git clone git@github.com:your-username/conda "%CONDA_PROJECT_ROOT%"
   > cd "%CONDA_PROJECT_ROOT%"

   # set the `upstream` as the main repository
   > git remote add upstream git@github.com:conda/conda
   ```

3. One option is to create a local development environment and activate that environment

   **Bash (macOS, Linux, Windows)**

   ```bash
   $ source ./dev/start
   ```

   **cmd.exe (Windows)**

   ```batch
   > .\dev\start.bat
   ```

   This command will create a project-specific base environment (see `devenv`
   in your repo directory after running this command). If the base environment
   already exists this command will simply activate the already-created
   `devenv` environment.

   To be sure that the conda code being interpreted is the code in the project
   directory, look at the value of `conda location:` in the output of
   `conda info --all`.

4. Alternatively, for Linux development only, you can use the same Docker
   image the CI pipelines use. Note that you can run this from all three
   operating systems! We are using `docker compose`, which provides three
   actions for you:

   - `unit-tests`: Run all unit tests.
   - `integration-tests`: Run all integration tests.
   - `interactive`: You are dropped in a pre-initialized Bash session,
     where you can run all your `pytest` commands as required.

   Use them with `docker compose run <action>`. For example:


   **Any shell (macOS, Linux, Windows)**

   ```bash
   $ docker compose run unit-tests
   ```

   This builds the same Docker image as used in continuous
   integration from the [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/conda/conda/pkgs/container/conda-ci)
   and starts `bash` with the conda development mode already enabled.
   By default, it will use Python 3.9 installation.

   If you need a different Python version, set a `CONDA_DOCKER_PYTHON`
   environment variable like this to rebuild the image. You might need
   to add `--no-cache` to make sure the image is rebuilt.

   **Bash (macOS, Linux, Windows)**

   ```bash
   $ CONDA_DOCKER_PYTHON=3.8 docker compose build --no-cache unit-tests
   ```

   **cmd.exe (Windows)**

   ```batch
   > set CONDA_DOCKER_PYTHON=3.8 && docker compose build --no-cache unit-tests && set "CONDA_DOCKER_PYTHON="
   ```

   The next time you run `docker compose run <task>` you will use the new image.
   If you want to revert to the version you were previously using, you need to rebuild
   the image again.

>  The `conda` repository will be mounted to `/opt/conda-src`, so all changes
   done in your editor will be reflected live while the Docker container is
   running.

## Static Code Analysis

This project is configured with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to
automatically run linting and other static code analysis on every commit.
Running these tools prior to the PR/code review process helps in two ways:

1. it helps *you* by automating the nitpicky process of identifying and
   correcting code style/quality issues
2. it helps *us* where during code review we can focus on the substance of
   your contribution

Feel free to read up on everything pre-commit related in their
[docs](https://pre-commit.com/#quick-start) but we've included the gist of
what you need to get started below:

**Bash (macOS, Linux, Windows)**

```bash
# reuse the development environment created above
$ source ./dev/start
# or start the Docker image in interactive mode
# $ docker compose run interactive

# install pre-commit hooks for conda
$ cd "$CONDA_PROJECT_ROOT"
$ pre-commit install

# manually running pre-commit on current changes
# note: by default pre-commit only runs on staged files
$ pre-commit run

# automatically running pre-commit during commit
$ git commit
```

**cmd.exe (Windows)**

```batch
:: reuse the development environment created above
> .\dev\start.bat
:: or start the Docker image in interactive mode
:: > docker compose run interactive

:: install pre-commit hooks for conda
> cd "%CONDA_PROJECT_ROOT%"
> pre-commit install

:: manually running pre-commit on current changes
:: note: by default pre-commit only runs on staged files
> pre-commit run

:: automatically running pre-commit during commit
> git commit
```

Beware that some of the tools run by pre-commit can potentially modify the
code (see [black](https://github.com/psf/black),
[blacken-docs](https://github.com/asottile/blacken-docs), and
[darker](https://github.com/akaihola/darker)). If pre-commit detects that any
files were modified it will terminate the commit giving you the opportunity to
review the code before committing again.

Strictly speaking using pre-commit on your local machine for commits is
optional (if you don't install pre-commit you will still be able to commit
normally). But once you open a PR to contribue your changes, pre-commit will
be automatically run at which point any errors that occur will need to be
addressed prior to proceeding.

## Testing

We use pytest to run our test suite. Please consult pytest's
[docs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/usage.html) for detailed instructions
but generally speaking all you need is the following:

**Bash (macOS, Linux, Windows)**

```bash
# reuse the development environment created above
$ source ./dev/start
# or start the Docker image in interactive mode
# $ docker compose run interactive

# run conda's unit tests using GNU make
$ make unit

# or alternately with pytest
$ pytest -m "not integration" conda tests

# or you can use pytest to focus on one specific test
$ pytest tests/test_create.py -k create_install_update_remove_smoketest
```

**cmd.exe (Windows)**

```batch
:: reuse the development environment created above
> .\dev\start.bat
:: or start the Docker image in interactive mode
:: > docker compose run interactive

:: run conda's unit tests with pytest
> pytest -m "not integration" conda tests

:: or you can use pytest to focus on one specific test
> pytest tests\test_create.py -k create_install_update_remove_smoketest
```

Note: Some integration tests require you build a package with conda-build beforehand.
This is taking care of if you run `docker compose run integration-tests`, but you need
to do it manually in other modes:

**Bash (macOS, Linux, Windows)**

```bash
$ conda install conda-build
$ conda-build tests/test-recipes/activate_deactivate_package
```

Check `dev/linux/integration.sh` and `dev\windows\integration.bat` for more details.


## Conda Contributor License Agreement

In case you're new to CLAs, this is rather standard procedure for larger
projects. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/cla/) and
[Python](https://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form/) for example
both use similar agreements.

Note: New contributors are required to complete the [Conda Contributor License Agreement][1].

For pull requests to be merged, contributors to GitHub pull requests need to
have signed the [Conda Contributor License Agreement][1], so Anaconda, Inc.
has it on file. A record of prior signatories is kept in a [separate repo in
conda's GitHub][2] organization.

## Releasing

Conda releases may be performed via the [rever command](https://regro.github.io/rever-docs/).
Rever is configured to perform the activities for a typical conda-build release.
To cut a release, simply run `rever <X.Y.Z>` where `<X.Y.Z>` is the
release number that you want bump to. For example, `rever 1.2.3`.

However, it is always good idea to make sure that the you have permissions
everywhere to actually perform the release. So it is customary to run
`rever check` before the release, just to make sure.

The standard workflow is thus:

```bash
$ rever check
$ rever 1.2.3
```

If for some reason a release fails partway through, or you want to claw back a
release that you have made, rever allows you to undo activities. If you find yourself
in this pickle, you can pass the `--undo` option a comma-separated list of
activities you'd like to undo. For example:

```bash
$ rever --undo tag,changelog,authors 1.2.3
```

Happy releasing!
