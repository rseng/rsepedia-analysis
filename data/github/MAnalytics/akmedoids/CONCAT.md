# Statement of Need

In social and behavioural sciences, longitudinal clustering is widely used for identifying groups of individual trends that correspond to certain developmental processes over time. Whilst popular clustering techniques, such as k-means, are suited for identifying spherical clusters [@GenoFali:2010; @Curman:2015], there has been little attempt to modify such methods to identify alternative forms of cluster, such as those that represent linear growth over time (i.e. directionally-homogeneous clusters). To address this shortcoming, we introduce `Anchored k-medoids`, a package referred to as `Ak-medoids`, which implements a medoid-based expectation maximisation (MEM) procedure within a classical k-means clustering framework.  The package includes functions to assist in the manipulation of longitudinal data sets prior to the clustering procedure, and the visualisation of solutions post-procedure. The potential application areas of `Ak-medoids` include criminology, transport, epidemiology and brain imaging.

# Design and implementation

Previous studies have taken advantage of the various functional characteristics of longitudinal data in order to extract theoretically or empirically interesting clusters of subjects. Examples include using the Fourier basis [@Tarpey:2003] or the coefficients of the B-spline derivative estimates [@Boor:1978; @Schumaker:2007] which anchor clustering routines to better capture a presumed developmental process. Here, we develop an `Anchored k-medoids` (`Akmedoids`) clustering package, which employs the ordinary least square (OLS) trend lines of subjects, and a bespoke expectation-maximisation procedure, specifically to capture long-term linear growth. In criminology, identifying such slow-changing trends helps to unravel place-based characteristics that drive crime-related events, such as street gun and homicide, across a geographical space [@Griffith:2004]. To date, explorations of these trends have deployed existing techniques, namely k-means [@Curman:2015; @Andresen:2017] and group-based trajectory modelling [@Weisburd:2004; @Chavez:2009; @Bannister:2017], which are suited for spherical clusters [@GenoFali:2010]. The sensitivity of such techniques to short-term fluctuations and outliers in longitudinal datasets makes it more difficult to extract clusters based on the underlying long-term trends. `Akmdeoids` is tailored for such a scenario.
The main clustering function in the `Akmedoids` package  implements a medoid-based expectation maximisation (MEM) procedure by integrating certain key modifications into the classical k-means routine. First, it approximates longitudinal trajectories using OLS regression and second, anchors the initialisation process with medoid observations. It then deploys the medoid observations as new anchors for each iteration of the expectation-maximisation procedure [@Celeux:1992], until convergence. In a similar fashion to classical k-means, the routine relies on distance-based similarity between vectors of observations and is scale invariant. This implementation ensures that the impact of short-term fluctuations and outliers are minimised. The final groupings are augmented with the raw trajectories, and visualised, in order to provide a clearer delineation of the long-term linear trends of subject trajectories. Given an `l` number of iterations, the computational complexity of the clustering routine is the same as that of a classical k-means algorithm, i.e. `O(lkn)`, where `k` is the specified number of clusters and `n`, the number of individual trajectories. The optimal number of clusters for a given data may be determined using the average silhouette [@Rousseeuw:1987] or the Calinski and Harabasz criterion [@Calinski:1974]. A full demonstration is provided in the package vignette of how to deploy `Akmedoids` to examine long-term relative exposure to crime in `R` [@rManual:2020]. We encourage the use of the package outside of criminology.

# Clustering and cluster representations

The main clustering function of akmedoids is `akclustr`. The function captures directionally homogeneous clusters within any given longitudinal dataset using the procedure detailed above. For crime inequality studies, the package includes the `props` function for converting the absolute (or rate) measures of individual trajectories into a relative measures over time. The package includes the `print_akstats` and `plot_akstats` functions to generate the properties of clusters and visualize the clusters, respectively. In particular, the `plot_akstats` function draws from the `ggplot2` library [@ggplot:2016] in order to visualize the resulting clusters in either a line or an areal-stacked graph format.

An R package for analyzing and clustering longitudinal data

### Description

The `akmedoids` package advances the clustering of longitudinal datasets
in order to identify clusters of trajectories with similar long-term
linear trends over time, providing an improved cluster identification as
compared with the classic kmeans algorithm. The package also includes a
set of functions for addressing common data issues, such as missing
entries and outliers, prior to conducting advance longitudinal data
analysis. One of the key objectives of this package is to facilitate
easy replication of a recent paper which examined small area inequality
in the crime drop (Adepeju et al.Â 2020). Many of the functions provided
in the `akmedoids` package may be applied to longitudinal data in
general.

**For more information and usability, check out details on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/akmedoids/index.html).**

### Installation from `CRAN`

From an R console, type:

    #install.packages("akmedoids")
    library(akmedoids)

    #Other libraries
    library(tidyr)
    library(ggplot2)
    #> Warning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.0.3
    library(reshape)
    #> Warning: package 'reshape' was built under R version 4.0.3
    library(readr)

To install the development version of the package, type

installation problems in the issues.

### Example usage:

Given a longitudinal datasets, the following is an example of how
`akmedoids` could be used to extract clusters of trajectories with
similar long-term trends over time. We will use a simulated dataset
(named `simulated.rda`) stored in the `data/` directory.

### Generating artificial dataset

Simulating data set which comprised of three clusters with distinct mean
directional change over time. Each group contains 50 trajectories.

    dir.create("input") # create a folder
    #> Warning in dir.create("input"): 'input' already exists

    #function for creating longitudinal noise
    noise_fn <- function(x=3, time){
      rnorm(length(time), mean=0, x)}

    #function for simulating a trajectory group
    sim_group <- function(gr_baseline, sd, time){
      intcp_errors <- rgamma(1, shape=2, scale=sd) #intercept error
      mean_traj = gr_baseline + intcp_errors
      traj = mean_traj + noise_fn(intcp_errors, time)
    }

    #time steps
    t_steps <- c(0:20)

    #increasing group
    i_gr <- NULL
    for(i in seq_len(50)){
      i_gr <- rbind(i_gr,
                    sim_group(gr_baseline=(0.5*t_steps),
                              sd=1, time=t_steps))
    }

    #stable group
    s_gr <- NULL
    for(i in seq_len(50)){
      s_gr <- rbind(s_gr,
                    sim_group(gr_baseline=rep(3,length(t_steps)),
                              sd=1, time=t_steps))
    }

    #decreasing group
    d_gr <- NULL
    for(i in seq_len(50)){
      d_gr <- rbind(d_gr,
                    sim_group(gr_baseline=(10 - (0.5*t_steps)),
                              sd=1, time=t_steps))
    }

    #combine groups
    simulated <- data.frame(rbind(i_gr, s_gr, d_gr))

    #add group label
    simulated <- data.frame(cbind(ID=1:nrow(simulated), simulated))

    colnames(simulated) <- c("ID", 1:(ncol(simulated)-1))

    #save data set
    ##simulated = readr::write_csv(simulated, "input/example-simulated.csv")
