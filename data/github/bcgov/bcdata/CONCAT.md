An R package üì¶ for searching & retrieving data from the [B.C. Data
Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca).

-   `bcdc_browse()` - Open the catalogue in your default browser
-   `bcdc_search()` - Search records in the catalogue
-   `bcdc_search_facets()` - List catalogue facet search options
-   `bcdc_get_record()` - Print a catalogue record
-   `bcdc_tidy_resources()` - Get a data frame of resources for a record
-   `bcdc_get_data()` - Get catalogue data
-   `bcdc_query_geodata()` - Get & query catalogue geospatial data
    available through a [Web Feature
    Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service)

**Note:** The `bcdata` package supports downloading *most* file types,
including zip archives. It will do its best to identify and read data
from zip files, however if there are multiple data files in the zip, or
data files that `bcdata` doesn‚Äôt know how to import, it will fail. If
you encounter a file type in the B.C. Data Catalogue not currently
supported by `bcdata` please file an
[issue](https://github.com/bcgov/bcdata/issues/).

### Reference

[bcdata package üì¶ home page and reference
guide](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/)

### Installation

You can install `bcdata` directly from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bcdata):

``` r
install.packages("bcdata")
```

To install the development version from GitHub, use the
[remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) package:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("bcgov/bcdata")
library(bcdata)
```

### Vignettes

-   [Get Started with
    bcdata](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/articles/bcdata.html)
-   [Querying Spatial Data with
    bcdata](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/articles/efficiently-query-spatial-data-in-the-bc-data-catalogue.html)
-   [Exploring Silviculture Data with
    bcdata](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/articles/explore-silviculture-data-using-bcdata.html)

### Methods for `bcdc_promise`

The `bcdc_query_geodata()` returns an object of the class
`bcdc_promise`. We have written an ever growing list methods for this
class. You can use these methods directly on a object returned by
`bcdc_query_geodata()`. Here are all the methods for the `bcdc_promise`
class:

-   `as_tibble`
-   `collect`
-   `filter`
-   `head`
-   `mutate`
-   `names`
-   `print`
-   `select`
-   `show_query`
-   `tail`

### BCDC Authentication

If you are an authorized editor of the B.C. Data Catalogue you may want
to access records that are not publicly available (e.g., in DRAFT,
waiting to be published). This can be done by authenticating with the
catalogue with an API key.

***Important Note:*** *Your API key is like a password and you must take
care to keep it private. Do not share it, and be careful to not include
it in any scripts or accidentally commit it to GitHub.*

You can log in to the catalogue to obtain your API key, then store it as
an environment variable in your [`.Renviron`
file](https://rstats.wtf/r-startup.html#renviron). The environment
variable must be called `BCDC_KEY`, set like this:

    BCDC_KEY=your-api-key

This way, the relevant bcdata functions will read that key and use it to
authorize your calls to the catalogue, allowing you to access additional
records that you are authorized to see if you were logged into the
catalogue web interface. Functions that benefit from this are:

-   `bcdc_search()`
-   `bcdc_list()`
-   `bcdc_get_record()`
-   `bcdc_get_data()`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*This project was created using the
[bcgovr](https://github.com/bcgov/bcgovr) package.*
# bcdata (development version)

* Added `bcdc_get_citation` to generate bibliographic entries (via `utils::bibentry`) for individuals records. #273
* Results from `bcdc_search()` (objects of class `"bcdc_recordlist"`) now print 50 records by default, instead of 10. In addition, there is a new `[` method for `"bcdc_recordlist"` objects, allowing you to subset these lists and still have a nice printout (#288).
* Ensure that `bcdc_get_data()` fails informatively when a given resource doesn't exist in a record (#290)


# bcdata 0.3.0

* The [BC Data Catalogue and its API have been updated](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=8A553CABCCDD434D8614D1CA92B03400), requiring changes to the `bcdata` package, most of which are internal only (#283). These should be mostly invisible to the user, except for the removal of the `type` search facet in `bcdc_search()` and `bcdc_search_facets()`. If you use an API key (authorized catalogue editors only), you will need to login to the new catalogue and get your updated key and set the value your `BCDC_KEY` environment variable to the new key.

### IMPROVEMENTS
* Add `names` method for `bcdc.promise` objects. You can now call `names` on an object produced by `bcdc_query_geodata`. This is handy when trying to figure out exact column spelling etc. #278

### BUG FIXES
* Fix bug where sticky column were incorrectly identified in `bcdc_describe_feature` (#279)

# bcdata 0.2.4

* Code in `.onLoad()` that sent a request to the wfs getCapabilities endpoint could cause the package to fail to load. This was moved into an internal function `bcdc_get_capabilities()` that makes the request the first time it's required, and stores the result for the remainder of the session (#271)
* testthat is now used conditionally to only run tests if the testthat package is installed.

# bcdata 0.2.3

### IMPROVEMENTS
- Setting the `bcdata.single_download_limit` limit dynamically from the getCapabilities endpoint. #256
- `bcdc_describe_feature` now joins an object description column to the returned object to provide more information about a field directly in R. #241, #259
- Better documentation and information surrounding the `bcdata.max_geom_pred_size` option. #243, #258 
- Add new function `bcdc_check_geom_size` so users can check prior to submitting a WFS request with `filter` to see 
if the request will require a bounding box conversion. #243, #258
- Better documentation and messaging about when and why paginated requests are required by `bcdc_query_geodata()`. #240, #264
- Better documentation and print method for what records are suitable for use with `bcdc_query_geodata()`. #265, #267

# bcdata 0.2.2
### IMPROVEMENTS
* Added `bcdc_list_groups` and `bcdc_list_group_records` to provide the ability to query on the group endpoint of the catalogue API. #234
* Added new option `bcdata.single_download_limit` to enable setting the maximum number of records an object can be before forcing a paginated download (#252)

### BUG FIXES
* Fixed bug in `collect.bcdc_promise` where the wrong parameter name in `crul::Paginator$new()` resulted in an error in paginated wfs requests (#250, thanks @meztez)
* Fixed a bug where the name of `bcdata.chunk_limit` option had a typo, so that it was not actually used properly (#252)

# bcdata 0.2.1

### BUG FIXES
* Remove link for pipe documentation for simplicity.
* Fixed bug where using many `as.` functions (e.g., `as.Date()`, `as.character()`, `as.numeric()`) in a filter statement would fail. (#218, #219)

### MAINTENANCE
* Updated internal SQL translation to use `DBI` S4 generics (`DBI::dbQuoteIdentifier()` is now used instead of 
  `dbplyr::sql_escape_ident()` and `DBI::dbQuoteString()` instead of `dbplyr::sql_escape_string()`), to comply 
  with upcoming `dbplyr` 2.0 release (#225, #225; https://github.com/tidyverse/dbplyr/issues/385)
* Wrapped all examples that call web resources in `try()` to avoid spurious check failures (#229).

# bcdata 0.2.0

### BREAKING CHANGES
* Rename `selectable` column from `bcdc_describe_feature` to `sticky` and modify corresponding docs and tests (#180).

### IMPROVEMENTS
* Add explore-silviculture-data-using-bcdata vignette/article. h/t @hgriesbauer 
* Add `head` and `tail` methods for `bcdc.promise` objects. Thanks to @hgriesbauer for the suggestion! (#182, #186)
* Provide `as_tibble` as an alias for `collect` in line with `dbplyr` behaviour (#166)
* Geometry predicates can now take a `bbox` object as well as an `sf*` object (#176)
* When reading in excel files, `bcdc_get_data` now outputs a messages indicating the presence and names of any sheets (#190)
* `bcdc_get_data()` & `bcdc_query_geodata()` will now work with full B.C. data catalogue url including resource (#125, #196)
* `bcdc_sf` objects now have an `time_downloaded` attribute
* Authorized B.C. Data Catalogue editors can now authenticate with the catalogue by setting 
a `BCDC_KEY` environment variable with their catalogue API token (https://github.com/bcgov/bcdata#bcdc-authentication; #208).

### BUG FIXES
* Fix `select`, `filter` and `mutate` roxygen so that bcdata specific documentation to these methods is available
* Add tests for attributes

# bcdata 0.1.2

### IMPROVEMENTS
* Add `bcdc_tidy_resources` for retrieving a data frame containing the metadata for all resources from a single B.C. Data Catalogue record (PR#149, #147)
* Add a more decorative record print method  (#73)
* More reliable detection of layer name for a wfs call in `bcdc_query_geodata()` (#129, #138, #139)
* Add `mutate` method for bcdc_promise that only fails and suggest an alternative approach. (PR#134)
* Add back in querying vignette
* Using `tidyselect` so that `select.bcdc_promise` behaviour is typical of `dplyr::select` ($140, #138)
* Using GitHub actions for CI. 

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES
* Remove `BEYOND()` and `RELATE()` geometry predicates as they are currently not fully supported by geoserver
                                                        
### BUG FIXES
* Now precompiling vignettes so that queries are submitted locally and no actually requests are made from CRAN (#151)
* Fix `NOTE: Namespace in Imports field not imported from: ‚Äòmethods‚Äô` error on CRAN (#145)
* Fixed a bug where functions nested inside geometry predicates were not evaluated (#146, #154)
* Fixed a bug where `DWITHIN` wasn't working because `units` needed to be unquoted (#154)
* Fixed a bug where `BBOX()` used in a `filter()` statement combined with `bcdc_query_geodata()` did not work (#135, #137, #131)
* Fixed a bug where layer names with a number in them would not work in `bcdc_query_geodata()` (#126, #127)


# bcdata 0.1.1

* Expand and standardize checking w[ms]f features to make package more resistant to slight warehouse API changes. 
* Data retrieval functions now work with BCGW name (#106)
* Add CITATION file (#104)
* Increased test coverage (#112)
* Skipping all tests on CRAN that require a web connection
* Better and more informative error message when experiencing http failures occur (#121)
* Added print methods for `show_query`
* Change examples to donttest
* Added verbose argument to `bcdc_get_record` to enable suppressing console writing

# bcdata 0.1.0

* Initial Release

An R package üì¶ for searching & retrieving data from the [B.C. Data Catalogue]( https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca).

- `bcdc_browse()` - Open the catalogue in your default browser
- `bcdc_search()` - Search records in the catalogue
- `bcdc_search_facets()` - List catalogue facet search options
- `bcdc_get_record()` - Print a catalogue record
- `bcdc_tidy_resources()` - Get a data frame of resources for a record
- `bcdc_get_data()` - Get catalogue data
- `bcdc_query_geodata()` - Get & query catalogue geospatial data available through a [Web Feature Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service)

**Note:** The `bcdata` package supports downloading _most_ file types, including zip archives. It will do its best to identify and read data from
zip files, however if there are multiple data files in the zip, or data files that `bcdata` doesn't know how to import, it will fail. 
If you encounter a file type in the B.C. Data Catalogue not currently supported by `bcdata` please file an [issue](https://github.com/bcgov/bcdata/issues/). 

### Reference
[bcdata package üì¶ home page and reference guide](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/)

### Installation
You can install `bcdata` directly from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bcdata): 

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bcdata")
```

To install the development version from GitHub, use the [remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("bcgov/bcdata")
library(bcdata)
```

- [Exploring Silviculture Data with bcdata](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/articles/explore-silviculture-data-using-bcdata.html)

### Methods for `bcdc_promise`

The `bcdc_query_geodata()` returns an object of the class `bcdc_promise`. We have written an ever growing list methods for this class. You can use these methods directly on a object returned by `bcdc_query_geodata()`. Here are all the methods for the `bcdc_promise` class:

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
bcdc_methods <- methods(class = "bcdc_promise")
bcdc_methods <- sort(attributes(bcdc_methods)$info[,c("generic"), ])

cat(paste0("- `", bcdc_methods, "`", collapse = "\n"))
```


### BCDC Authentication

If you are an authorized editor of the B.C. Data Catalogue you may want to
access records that are not publicly available (e.g., in DRAFT, waiting to be
published). This can be done by authenticating with the catalogue with an API
key.

_**Important Note:**_ *Your API key is like a password and you must take care to
keep it private. Do not share it, and be careful to not include it in any
scripts or accidentally commit it to GitHub.*

You can log in to the catalogue to obtain your API key, then store it as an
environment variable in your [`.Renviron` file](https://rstats.wtf/r-startup.html#renviron). 
The environment variable must be called `BCDC_KEY`, set like this:

```
BCDC_KEY=your-api-key
```

This way, the relevant bcdata functions will read that key and use it to
authorize your calls to the catalogue, allowing you to access additional records
that you are authorized to see if you were logged into the catalogue web
interface. Functions that benefit from this are:

- `bcdc_search()`
- `bcdc_list()`
- `bcdc_get_record()`
- `bcdc_get_data()`

This vignette illustrates how to use `bcdata::bcdc_query_geodata` to request and query geospatial data that has an associated [Web Feature Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service) from the [B.C. Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset). To illustrate, we will request and merge two spatial data sets from the catalogue---school district and greenspaces spatial data---and then examine the amount of park space contained within the boundaries of the Greater Victoria, Prince George and Kamloops/Thompson British Columbia school districts.

## Getting Started
First you need to load the package. We will also load the `sf` and `dplyr` packages to help us work with spatial data. You can learn more about the `sf` package [here](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) and `dplyr` [here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/):


```r
library(bcdata)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
```


## Geospatial Data in the B.C. Data Catalogue
The [B.C. Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset) provides many data sets with spatial information through a [Web Feature Service (WFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service). Technically speaking, this means if we have an internet connection we can issue [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) requests to the catalogue and seamlessly import the response data into R as an `sf` objects. The `bcdata` package provides a means to a) choose which layer you want and b) use `dplyr` verbs to specifically tailor your request.  A `dbplyr` backend is implemented so that requests are executed lazily meaning results are not transferred over the web until the user specifically calls the `collect` function. This approach mimics the `dplyr` verb translation to `SQL` seen for many database types. A good introduction to principles of `dbplyr` is available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dbplyr/vignettes/dbplyr.html).

## School District Data
Our first step is to extract the [school district polygons](https://catalog.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/78ec5279-4534-49a1-97e8-9d315936f08b) from the B.C. Data Catalogue. This layer is described using this command:


```r
bcdc_get_record("78ec5279-4534-49a1-97e8-9d315936f08b")
#> B.C. Data Catalogue Record: School Districts of BC
#> Name: school-districts-of-bc (ID: 78ec5279-4534-49a1-97e8-9d315936f08b)
#> Permalink: https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/78ec5279-4534-49a1-97e8-9d315936f08b
#> Licence: Open Government Licence - British Columbia
#> Description: The School Districts dataset contains the spatial representation (polygon)
#>  of the current extent of the administrative areas defined under section 176(1) of the
#>  School Act for the purposes of preservation and promotion of the fundamental principle
#>  of local autonomy and control of public education at the public and governmental levels
#>  through locally elected school boards.
#> Available Resources (1):
#>  1. WMS getCapabilities request (wms)
#> Access the full 'Resources' data frame using:
#>  bcdc_tidy_resources('78ec5279-4534-49a1-97e8-9d315936f08b')
#> Query and filter this data using:
#>  bcdc_query_geodata('78ec5279-4534-49a1-97e8-9d315936f08b')
```

This data is the boundary of each school district. The key information in this metadata is that the layer has a resource in `"wms"` format ---which means it is available through a Web Feature Service. From this we know we can make use of `bcdc_query_geodata`.


```r
bcdc_query_geodata("78ec5279-4534-49a1-97e8-9d315936f08b")

This is the initial query to the data in the catalogue. What has been returned is *not* the actual data but rather a subset to help you tune your query. The printed output of this query offers several useful pieces of information. Because we have queried with a unique ID, we are shown the name of the record. We also receive instruction that using `collect()` will retrieve a given number of features and fields present for this query. Lastly, there is a reminder that what is printed is only the first 6 rows of the record. Since we are limiting the scope of analysis to the Greater Victoria, Prince George and Kamloops/Thompson school districts, we want to ask the catalogue for only those polygons just like we would in a typical `dplyr` workflow:


```r
bcdc_query_geodata("78ec5279-4534-49a1-97e8-9d315936f08b") %>%
  filter(SCHOOL_DISTRICT_NAME %in% c("Greater Victoria", "Prince George","Kamloops/Thompson"))
#> Querying 'school-districts-of-bc' record
#> ‚Ä¢ Using collect() on this object will return 1 features and 9 fields
#> ‚Ä¢ At most six rows of the record are printed here
#> ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ

```

To further tune our query, we can also request only the columns we want. Really we only want the school district column and the spatial information. During an actual analysis, it is possible that you may need to initially collect more data than you want to determine value to subset by. For example, there is currently no way to ask the catalogue for all possible unique values of `SCHOOL_DISTRICT_NAME`. Is that case the data will need to be brought into R and unique values will need to be determined there.


```r
bcdc_query_geodata("78ec5279-4534-49a1-97e8-9d315936f08b") %>%
  filter(SCHOOL_DISTRICT_NAME %in% c("Greater Victoria", "Prince George","Kamloops/Thompson")) %>%
  select(SCHOOL_DISTRICT_NAME)
#> Querying 'school-districts-of-bc' record
#> ‚Ä¢ Using collect() on this object will return 1 features and 5 fields
#> ‚Ä¢ At most six rows of the record are printed here
#> ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
#> Simple feature collection with 1 feature and 5 fields
#> Geometry type: POLYGON
#> Dimension:     XY
#> Bounding box:  xmin: 1126789 ymin: 821142.1 xmax: 1528155 ymax: 1224202
#> Projected CRS: NAD83 / BC Albers
#> # A tibble: 1 √ó 6
#>   id        ADMIN_AREA_SID SCHOOL_DISTRICT_‚Ä¶ SCHOOL_DISTRICT‚Ä¶ OBJECTID                      geometry
#>   <chr>              <int> <chr>                        <int>    <int>                 <POLYGON [m]>

```

Note that in the `select` statement, we did not explicitly ask for the spatial data and also that there are several columns present that we didn't select. This is because within each data set in the data catalogue, there are several columns that will always be returned regardless of what is selected. If you really don't want those columns after you `collect` the data, which we will take care of right now, you can drop them:


```r
districts <- bcdc_query_geodata("78ec5279-4534-49a1-97e8-9d315936f08b") %>%
  filter(SCHOOL_DISTRICT_NAME %in% c("Greater Victoria", "Prince George","Kamloops/Thompson")) %>%
  select(SCHOOL_DISTRICT_NAME) %>%
  collect()
```

Again note here that we have assigned the object a name and added the `collect` statement. This step happens when you have selected the data you want and wish to begin working with it in R like a normal `sf` object. For example, we can now plot these three school districts:


```r
plot(st_geometry(districts))
```

<img src="vignette-fig-districts-1.png" title="plot of chunk districts" alt="plot of chunk districts" width="100%" />

Now that we have the spatial boundaries narrowed by specific school districts we can perform some spatial operations to determine parks in the school districts.

## Greenspaces Data
For the purposes of this example, let's consider [this greenspace](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/6a2fea1b-0cc4-4fc2-8017-eaf755d516da) layer in the catalogue. This layer is described here:


```r
bcdc_get_record("6a2fea1b-0cc4-4fc2-8017-eaf755d516da")
#> B.C. Data Catalogue Record: Local and Regional Greenspaces
#> Name: local-and-regional-greenspaces (ID: 6a2fea1b-0cc4-4fc2-8017-eaf755d516da)
#> Permalink: https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/6a2fea1b-0cc4-4fc2-8017-eaf755d516da
#> Licence: Open Government Licence - British Columbia
#> Description: This dataset contains spatial and attribute information for local and
#>  regional greenspaces in British Columbia. Local and regional greenspaces are municipal
#>  or regional district lands designated by local government agencies and managed for
#>  public enjoyment, ecosystem or wildlife values. Spatial boundaries were sourced from
#>  municipal and regional district web sites, which in some cases provide datasets under
#>  Open Government Licence, and in other cases, publicize parks and greenspaces on web maps
#>  or pdf maps. Boundaries were edge-matched to the ParcelMap BC cadastre.  This spatial
#>  layer contains multipart polygons.
#> Available Resources (2):
#>  1. WMS getCapabilities request (wms)
#>  2. LocalRegionalParksAttributeValues (xlsx)
#> Access the full 'Resources' data frame using:
#>  bcdc_tidy_resources('6a2fea1b-0cc4-4fc2-8017-eaf755d516da')
#> Query and filter this data using:
#>  bcdc_query_geodata('6a2fea1b-0cc4-4fc2-8017-eaf755d516da')
```

Again we recognize this is [WFS-enabled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service) geospatial data, which means we can make use of `bcdc_query_geodata`.

Since we are interested in only "Park" data we can subset our query:


```r
bcdc_query_geodata("6a2fea1b-0cc4-4fc2-8017-eaf755d516da") %>%
  filter(PARK_PRIMARY_USE == "Park")
#> Querying 'local-and-regional-greenspaces' record

Here we see that this greatly reduces the number of features that we are dealing with (and correspondingly the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the web). Remember also that we still have not actually requested the full data set. This is just still a preview. Also this query still includes all municipal parks in BC while we only want the ones in the three school districts - the polygons defined by the `districts` object. To find that subset of parks we can make use of the built-in geometric operators which allow us to perform spatial operations remotely fine tuning our query even further. Here using the `INTERSECTS` function is appropriate and since this is a last tuning step, we can call `collect` and assign a name to this object. These requests can sometimes take quite a long:


```r
districts_parks <- bcdc_query_geodata("6a2fea1b-0cc4-4fc2-8017-eaf755d516da") %>%
  filter(PARK_PRIMARY_USE == "Park") %>%
  filter(INTERSECTS(districts)) %>%
  collect()
#> The object is too large to perform exact spatial operations using bcdata.
#> Object size: 948576 bytes
#> BC Data Threshold: 500000 bytes
#> Exceedance: 448576 bytes
#> See ?bcdc_check_geom_size for more details
#> A bounding box was drawn around the object passed to INTERSECTS and all features within the box will be returned.
```

Plotting both the filtered parks data and the district polygons reveals an important consideration when using `bcdata`:

<img src="vignette-fig-district_parks-1.png" title="plot of chunk district_parks" alt="plot of chunk district_parks" width="100%" />

In this example, many parks not contained within the school districts are included in the `districts_parks` object. This is because rather than a full intersection, `bcdata` draws a bounding box around all the polygons that are doing the intersection (in this case `district`) and does the intersection based on that bounding box. This behaviour is imposed by the Web Feature Server but controlled via the `bcdata.max_geom_pred_size` option (See `?bcdc_options` for default values). Using this example, you can check to see if the size of the `districts` object exceeded the current value of `bcdata.max_geom_pred_size`:


```r
bcdc_check_geom_size(districts)
#> The object is too large to perform exact spatial operations using bcdata.
#> Object size: 948576 bytes
#> BC Data Threshold: 500000 bytes
#> Exceedance: 448576 bytes
#> See ?bcdc_check_geom_size for more details
```

Drawing the bounding box illustrates this point:

<img src="vignette-fig-bbox-1.png" title="plot of chunk bbox" alt="plot of chunk bbox" width="100%" />

We are left with two options to get around this problem. First, we can simply do some additional processing with the `sf` package. Specifically we can use a spatial join to assign parks into their respective district:


```r
districts_parks_join <- districts_parks %>%
  st_join(districts, left = FALSE)
```

<img src="vignette-fig-dp_join-1.png" title="plot of chunk dp_join" alt="plot of chunk dp_join" width="100%" />

A second approach is to set an internal option (`bcdata.max_geom_pred_size`) and increase the threshold of when a bounding box is drawn. Options are set in R like this:

```r
options("bcdata.max_geom_pred_size" = {object size in bytes})
```

The value of `bcdata.max_geom_pred_size` is set conservatively so that requests to the Web Feature Service are more consistently successful. Increasing this value may result in invalid requests.

Finally, to address our original question of which school district has the most municipal park space we can calculate the area of each park polygon and then sum those areas by school district:


```r
districts_parks_join %>%
  mutate(area = st_area(geometry)) %>%
  st_set_geometry(NULL) %>%
  group_by(SCHOOL_DISTRICT_NAME) %>%
  summarise(total_area = sum(area)) %>%
  arrange(total_area)
#> # A tibble: 1 √ó 2
#>   SCHOOL_DISTRICT_NAME total_area
#>   <chr>                     [m^2]
#> 1 Prince George         12254346.
```

## Additional Useful Functions
There are a couple of other functions in `bcdata` that are useful to know when working with spatial data from the catalogue. `bcdc_describe_feature` gives the column names, whether the column is selectable, and the column types in both R and on the remote server:


```r
bcdc_describe_feature("6a2fea1b-0cc4-4fc2-8017-eaf755d516da")

```

This is a helpful initial step to learn column names and types when you construct your query.

Another useful function is `show_query()` which provides information on the request issued to the remote server:


```r
bcdc_query_geodata("6a2fea1b-0cc4-4fc2-8017-eaf755d516da") %>%
  filter(PARK_PRIMARY_USE == "Park") %>%
  filter(INTERSECTS(districts)) %>%

```

This output is what being created by the dplyr code outlined above.

## Using B.C. Geographic Warehouse (BCGW) layer names

If you are familiar with the [B.C. Geographic Warehouse (BCGW)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/geographic-data-services/bc-spatial-data-infrastructure/bc-geographic-warehouse),
you may already know the name of a layer that you want from the BCGW.
`bcdc_query_geodata()` (as well as all other related functions)
supports supplying that name directly. For example, the
[record for the B.C. airports layer](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-airports#object-description)
shows that the object name is `WHSE_IMAGERY_AND_BASE_MAPS.GSR_AIRPORTS_SVW`, and
we can use that in `bcdc_query_geodata()`:


```r

This vignette will demonstrate how you can use `bcdata` to access and explore British Columbia silviculture data.


## Silviculture Data

Silviculture data for British Columbia are largely collected and stored through the [Reporting Silviculture Updates and Land Status Tracking System (RESULTS) database](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=F62992DA5B324446AD5E1B5BFFA404CC)---including information on the management of openings, disturbances, silviculture activities and obligation declarations as required by the [Forest and Range Practices Act](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=D65006C0326B4E0F838194044C10CA86). [RESULTS data sets are publically available through the B.C. Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset?q=RESULTS+silviculture) under the [Open Government Licence - British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61).


## Reforestation with Climate Considerations

[Western larch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larix_occidentalis) has been identified as a tree species that will be well-adapted to projected future climates in northern British Columbia.  In 2013, forest policy was developed that allowed foresters to plant western larch outside of its natural range as a climate change adaptation silviculture measure.

#### How much western larch has been planted in the Prince George Natural Resource District?

Let's use the `bcdata` package to search, retrieve and explore the RESULTS silviculture data and answer this question.


## Getting Started

To start, let's load the `bcdata` package. We will also load the `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages to help us work with the data. You can learn more about the `dplyr` package [here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and the `ggplot2` package [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/):


```r
library(bcdata)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```


## Getting the Data

We can gather the data we need to answer our question using the [RESULTS - silviculture forest cover dataset](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/258bb088-4113-47b1-b568-ce20bd64e3e3). First, let's take a look at the metadata record using `bcdc_get_record()`:


```r
# Get the metadata using the human-readable record name
bcdc_get_record("results-forest-cover-silviculture")
#> B.C. Data Catalogue Record: RESULTS - Forest Cover Silviculture
#> Name: results-forest-cover-silviculture (ID: 258bb088-4113-47b1-b568-ce20bd64e3e3)
#> Permalink: https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/258bb088-4113-47b1-b568-ce20bd64e3e3
#> Licence: Open Government Licence - British Columbia
#> Description: RESULTS opening's forest cover poylgons with silviculture component
#>  provided.  Current forest cover subimssion into RESULTS must contain attribute and map
#>  information.  However, there are historical forest cover polygon infomration where maps
#>  are not available.  Forest Cover is provided at three critical milestones of at
#>  harvesting, at regeneration, and at free growing.  This is a part o fthe Silviculture
#>  and Land Status Tracking dataset, which includes tracking achievement of silviculture
#>  obligations on Crown Land
#> Available Resources (1):
#>  1. WMS getCapabilities request (wms)
#> Access the full 'Resources' data frame using:
#>  bcdc_tidy_resources('258bb088-4113-47b1-b568-ce20bd64e3e3')
#> Query and filter this data using:
#>  bcdc_query_geodata('258bb088-4113-47b1-b568-ce20bd64e3e3')
```

We see that this is a [Web Feature Service-enabled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service) geospatial data set--the list of data resources includes `WMS getCapabilities request`--so we can query and retrieve this geospatial data set using `bcdc_query_geodata()`:


```r

#> ‚Ä¢ Using collect() on this object will return 898559 features and 159 fields
#> ‚Ä¢ Accessing this record requires pagination and will make 899 separate requests to the WFS.

```

This query shows that this data set has many features and over 150 fields.  Each feature is a treatment unit within a harvested opening, and contains information on the leading five tree species that are present in each treatment unit, including stems per hectare, age, and height.

Note that we have only _queried_ the data set so far---the data set would be too large (~1GB) to download efficiently.  So, let's use `filter()` with `bcdc_query_geodata()` to refine our query _before_ we collect the data and import it into R.


## Refining a Geospatial Data Query

To address our question, we need the treatment data (1) from the Prince George Natural Resource District _and_ (2) that contain western larch.

First, we can use the `bcdata` package to download the spatial boundary for the Prince George Natural Resource District&mdash;`DPG` is the `ORG_UNIT` for Prince George Natural Resource District:


```r
## Create a spatial feature object named dpg
dpg <- bcdc_query_geodata("natural-resource-nr-district") %>%
  filter(ORG_UNIT=="DPG") %>% # filter for Prince George Natural Resource District
  collect() # and collect the data
```

Let's plot this spatial object and double check we have we what we need:


```r
dpg %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_minimal()
```

<img src="vignette-fig-plot-dpg-1.png" title="plot of chunk plot-dpg" alt="plot of chunk plot-dpg" width="100%" />

Now we have a spatial object that we can use as a bounding box to filter and download records in the RESULTS - silviculture layer from the Prince George Natural Resource District.

We only need to download the treatments that have western larch planted. We can use the `bcdc_describe_feature()` helper function to examine the column names and types of the layer. In this case, we want to keep rows where the five `S_SPECIES_CODE_*` columns contain `"LW"`, the code for western larch.


```r
# Make a vector of tree species we are interested in
# (in this case only LW for western larch)
spp_list = c("LW")

# Query and filter the data layer
trees_dpg <-
  bcdc_query_geodata("258bb088-4113-47b1-b568-ce20bd64e3e3") %>%
  filter(INTERSECTS(dpg)) %>% #filter for records that are within the DPG boundary
  filter(
      S_SPECIES_CODE_1 %in% spp_list |  #filter for LW records
      S_SPECIES_CODE_2 %in% spp_list |
      S_SPECIES_CODE_3 %in% spp_list |
      S_SPECIES_CODE_4 %in% spp_list |
      S_SPECIES_CODE_5 %in% spp_list
  ) %>%
  collect() #collect/download the data
```


## Exploring the Data

Let's look at the dimensions of this now much more manageable data object we have downloaded from the B.C. Data Catalogue:


```r
dim(trees_dpg)
#> [1] 159 160
```

We can see there are several treatment units planted with western larch, and we can make a quick map of these harvested openings for the Prince George Natural Resource District:


```r
trees_dpg %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf() +
  geom_sf(data = dpg, fill = NA) + #add the DPG spatial boundary
  theme_minimal()
```

<img src="vignette-fig-map-larch-plantations-dpg-1.png" title="plot of chunk map-larch-plantations-dpg" alt="plot of chunk map-larch-plantations-dpg" width="100%" />


We can also create some quick descriptive summaries of the data, treating the geospatial attribute table as a data frame in R, and answer our original question---how much western larch has been planted in the Prince George Natural Resource District?


#### What is the size and age distribution of larch plantations in the Prince George Natural Resource District in the year 2020?


```r
trees_dpg %>%
  mutate(age = 2020 - REFERENCE_YEAR + S_SPECIES_AGE_1) %>% #create a plantation age column
  ggplot() +  #start a plot
  aes(x = age, y = FEATURE_AREA_SQM/10000) + #convert feature area to hectares
  geom_bar(stat = "sum") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Stand Age (years)",
                     limits = c(2, 30),
                     breaks = seq(from = 5, to = 30, by = 5)) +
  labs(y = "Sum Treatment Unit Area (ha)",
       title = "Area Planted with Western Larch by Stand Age\nin Prince George Natural Resource District",
       caption = paste0("Data sourced from the B.C. Data Catalogue\n on ",
                        Sys.Date(),
                        " using the bcdata R package")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

<img src="vignette-fig-unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1" width="100%" />

#### What is the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC) distribution of western larch plantations in the Prince George Natural Resource District?

We can download [British Columbia biogeoclimatic (BEC) data](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bec-map) from the B.C. Data Catalogue using `bcdata` and join to our existing `trees_dpg` geospatial dataset using the `st_join` function from the `sf` package. You can learn more about `sf` [here](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/).



```r
library(sf) #load the sf package

# Load the BEC data for Prince George Natural Resource District
bgc_dpg <- bcdc_query_geodata("WHSE_FOREST_VEGETATION.BEC_BIOGEOCLIMATIC_POLY") %>%
  filter(BBOX(dpg, crs = `EPSG:3005`)) %>% #note filtering with a BoundingBox
  collect()

# Join the BEC data with our tress_dpg geospatial data set
trees_bec_dpg <- trees_dpg %>%
  st_join(bgc_dpg[, "MAP_LABEL"]) #join BEC data for each polygon
```

Now, we can summarize the area planted with western larch by biogeoclimatic unit:


```r
trees_bec_dpg %>%
  group_by(MAP_LABEL) %>% # group polygons by biogeoclimatic unit
  summarise(Area = sum(FEATURE_AREA_SQM)/10000) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = MAP_LABEL, y = Area) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(y = "Sum Treatment Unit Area (ha)",
       x = "Biogeoclimatic Unit",
       title = "Area Planted with Western Larch by Biogeoclimatic Unit\nin Prince George Natural Resource District",
       caption = paste0("Data sourced from the B.C. Data Catalogue\n on ",
                        Sys.Date(),
                        " using the bcdata R package")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

The `bcdata` [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package contains functions for searching & retrieving data from the [B.C. Data Catalogue]( https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca).

The [B.C. Data Catalogue](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=79B5224167334667A44C9E8B5143D0C5) is the place to find British Columbia Government data, applications and web services. Much of the data are released under the [Open Government Licence --- British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/open-data/open-government-licence-bc), as well as numerous other [licences](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset?download_audience=Public).



You can install `bcdata` directly from CRAN:


```r
install.packages("bcdata")

library(bcdata)
```

### `bcdc_browse()`

`bcdata::bcdc_browse()` let's you access the [B.C. Data Catalogue web interface](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca) directly from R---opening the catalogue search page in your default browser:


```r
## Take me to the B.C. Data Catalogue home page
bcdc_browse()
```

If you know the catalogue "human-readable" record name or permanent ID you can open directly to the record web page:


```r
## Take me to the B.C. Winery Locations catalogue record using the record name
bcdc_browse("bc-winery-locations")

## Take me to the B.C. Winery Locations catalogue record using the record permanent ID
bcdc_browse("1d21922b-ec4f-42e5-8f6b-bf320a286157")
```

### `bcdc_search()`

`bcdc_search()` let's you search records in the B.C. Data Catalogue, returning the search results in your R session.

Let's search the catalogue for records that contain the word "recycling":


```r
## Give me the catalogue search results for 'recycling'
bcdc_search("recycling")
#> List of B.C. Data Catalogue Records
#> Number of records: 3
#> Titles:
#> 1: BC FIRST Tire Recycling Data 1991-2006 (csv)
#>  ID: a29ad492-29a2-44b9-8693-d27a8cc8e686
#>  Name: bc-first-tire-recycling-data-1991-2006
#> 2: Tire Stewardship BC Tire Recycling Data (csv)
#>  ID: f791329b-c2dc-4f82-9993-209780f2a1c6

#>  Name: environmental-protection-information-resources-e-library
#> 
#> Access a single record by calling `bcdc_get_record(ID)` with the ID from the desired
#>  record.
```

You can set the number of records to be returned from the search and/or you can customize your search using the catalogue search _facets_ `license_id`, `download_audience`, `res_format`, `sector`, and `organization`:


```r
## Give me the first catalogue search result for 'recycling'
bcdc_search("recycling", n = 1)
#> List of B.C. Data Catalogue Records
#> Number of records: 1
#> Titles:
#> 1: BC FIRST Tire Recycling Data 1991-2006 (csv)
#>  ID: a29ad492-29a2-44b9-8693-d27a8cc8e686
#>  Name: bc-first-tire-recycling-data-1991-2006
#> 
#> Access a single record by calling `bcdc_get_record(ID)` with the ID from the desired
#>  record.

## Give me the catalogue search results for 'recycling' where the
## data is licenced under Open Government Licence ‚Äì British Columbia
bcdc_search("recycling", license_id = "2")
#> List of B.C. Data Catalogue Records
#> Number of records: 1
#> Titles:
#> 1: BC FIRST Tire Recycling Data 1991-2006 (csv)
#>  ID: a29ad492-29a2-44b9-8693-d27a8cc8e686
#>  Name: bc-first-tire-recycling-data-1991-2006
#> 
#> Access a single record by calling `bcdc_get_record(ID)` with the ID from the desired
#>  record.
```

You can see all valid values for the catalogue search facets using `bcdata::bcdc_search_facets()`:


```r
## Valid values for search facet 'license_id'
bcdc_search_facets(facet = "license_id")
#>         facet count                                             display_name name
#> 1  license_id    62                           Statistics Canada Open Licence   21
#> 2  license_id     1               Queen's Printer Licence - British Columbia   25

#> 12 license_id  1395                                              Access Only   22
```

Finally, you can retrieve the _metadata_ for a single catalogue record by using the record name or permanent ID with `bcdc_get_record()`. It is advised to use the permanent ID rather than the human-readable name in non-interactive situations---like scripts---to guard against future name changes of a record:


```r
## Give me the catalogue record metadata for `bc-first-tire-recycling-data-1991-2006`

### `bcdc_get_data()`

Once you have located the B.C. Data Catalogue record with the data you want, you can use `bcdata::bcdc_get_data()` to download and read the data from the record.  You can use the record name, permanent ID or the result from `bcdc_get_record()`. Let's look at the B.C. Highway Web Cameras data:


```r

```

A catalogue record can have one or multiple data files---or "resources". If there is only one resource, `bcdc_get_data()` will return that resource by default, as in the above `bc-highway-cams` example. If there are multiple data resources you will need to specify which resource you want. Let's look at a catalogue record that contains multiple data resources---BC Schools - Programs Offered in Schools:


```r
## Get the record ID for the `bc-schools-programs-offered-in-schools` catalogue record
bcdc_search("school programs", n = 1)
#> List of B.C. Data Catalogue Records
#> Number of records: 1
#> Titles:
#> 1: BC Schools - Programs Offered in Schools (txt, xlsx)
#>  ID: b1f27d1c-244a-410e-a361-931fac62a524
#>  Name: bc-schools-programs-offered-in-schools
#> 
#> Access a single record by calling `bcdc_get_record(ID)` with the ID from the desired
#>  record.

## Get the metadata for the `bc-schools-programs-offered-in-schools` catalogue record
bcdc_get_record("b1f27d1c-244a-410e-a361-931fac62a524")
#> B.C. Data Catalogue Record: BC Schools - Programs Offered in Schools
#> Name: bc-schools-programs-offered-in-schools (ID: b1f27d1c-244a-410e-a361-931fac62a524)
#> Permalink: https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/b1f27d1c-244a-410e-a361-931fac62a524
#> Licence: Open Government Licence - British Columbia
#> Description: BC Schools English Language Learners, French Immersion, Francophone, Career
#>  Preparation, Aboriginal Support Services, Aboriginal Language and Culture, Continuing
#>  Education and Career Technical Programs offered in BC schools up to 2013/2014.
#> Available Resources (2):
#>  1. ProgramsOfferedinSchools.txt (txt)
#>  2. ProgramsOfferedinSchools.xlsx (xlsx)
#> Access the full 'Resources' data frame using:
#>  bcdc_tidy_resources('b1f27d1c-244a-410e-a361-931fac62a524')
```

We see there are two data files or resources available in this record, so we need to tell `bcdc_get_data()` which one we want. When used interactively, `bcdc_get_data()` will prompt you with the list of available resources through `bcdata` and ask you to select the resource you want. The resource ID for each data set is available _in_ the metadata record ‚òùÔ∏è:


```r
## Get the txt data resource from the `bc-schools-programs-offered-in-schools`
## catalogue record
bcdc_get_data("b1f27d1c-244a-410e-a361-931fac62a524", resource = 'a393f8cf-51ec-42c6-8449-4cea4c75385c')

Alternatively, you can retrieve the full details of the available resources for a given record as a data frame using `bcdc_tidy_resources()`:


```r
## Get a data frame of data resources for the `bc-schools-programs-offered-in-schools`
## catalogue record
bcdc_tidy_resources("b1f27d1c-244a-410e-a361-931fac62a524")
#> # A tibble: 2 √ó 9

```

`bcdc_get_data()` will also detect if the data resource is a geospatial file, and automatically reads and returns it as an [`sf` object](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) in your R session.

Let's get the air zones for British Columbia:


```r
## Find the B.C. Air Zones catalogue record
bcdc_search("air zones", res_format = "geojson")
#> List of B.C. Data Catalogue Records
#> Number of records: 1
#> Titles:
#> 1: British Columbia Air Zones (shp, kml, geojson)
#>  ID: e8eeefc4-2826-47bc-8430-85703d328516
#>  Name: british-columbia-air-zones
#> 
#> Access a single record by calling `bcdc_get_record(ID)` with the ID from the desired
#>  record.

## Get the metadata for the B.C. Air Zones catalogue record
bc_az_metadata <- bcdc_get_record("e8eeefc4-2826-47bc-8430-85703d328516")

## Get the B.C. Air Zone geospatial data
bc_az <- bcdc_get_data(bc_az_metadata, resource = "c495d082-b586-4df0-9e06-bd6b66a8acd9")

## Plot the B.C. Air Zone geospatial data with ggplot()
bc_az %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_minimal()
```

<img src="vignette-fig-air_zones-1.png" title="plot of chunk air_zones" alt="plot of chunk air_zones" width="100%" />


**Note:** The `bcdata` package supports downloading _most_ file types, including zip archives. It will do its best to identify and read data from
zip files, however if there are multiple data files in the zip, or data files that `bcdata` doesn't know how to import, it will fail.


### `bcdc_query_geodata()`

Many geospatial data sets in the B.C. Data Catalogue are available through a [Web Feature Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service). While `bcdc_get_data()` will retrieve the geospatial data for you, sometimes the geospatial file is very large---and slow to download---and/or you may only want _some_ of the data. `bcdc_query_geodata()` let's you query catalogue geospatial data available as a Web Feature Service using `select` and `filter` functions (just like in [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/). The `bcdc::collect()` function returns the `bcdc_query_geodata()` query results as an [`sf` object](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) in your R session.

Let's get the Capital Regional District boundary from the [B.C. Regional Districts geospatial data](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/d1aff64e-dbfe-45a6-af97-582b7f6418b9)---the whole file takes 30-60 seconds to download and I only need the one polygon, so why not save some time:


```r
## Find the B.C. Regional Districts catalogue record
bcdc_search("regional districts administrative areas", res_format = "wms", n = 1)
#> List of B.C. Data Catalogue Records
#> Number of records: 1
#> Titles:
#> 1: Regional Districts - Legally Defined Administrative Areas of BC (other, xlsx, wms,
#>  kml)
#>  ID: d1aff64e-dbfe-45a6-af97-582b7f6418b9
#>  Name: regional-districts-legally-defined-administrative-areas-of-bc
#> 
#> Access a single record by calling `bcdc_get_record(ID)` with the ID from the desired
#>  record.

## Get the metadata for the B.C. Regional Districts catalogue record
bc_regional_districts_metadata <- bcdc_get_record("d1aff64e-dbfe-45a6-af97-582b7f6418b9")

## We can see in the search results, and in the metadata record, that this record has a `"wms"`
## resource format, indicating that it is available as a Web Feature Service and thus
## we can query it using `bcdc_query_geodata()`

### API Version:

  - TEST: https://test.openmaps.gov.bc.ca
  - DELIVERY: https://delivery.openmaps.gov.bc.ca
  - PROD: https://openmaps.gov.bc.ca
  
  Endpoints:
  
  - wfs: `geo/pub/wfs`

It is advised to use the permanent ID for a record or the BCGW name rather than the

If you use the human-readable name a warning will be issued once per

}
\value{
\code{bcdc_describe_feature} returns a tibble describing the attributes of a B.C. Data Catalogue record.
The tibble returns the following columns:
\itemize{
\item col_name: attributes of the feature
\item sticky: whether a column can be separated from the record in a Web Feature Service call via the \code{dplyr::select} method
\item remote_col_type: class of what is return by the web feature service

\item column_comments: additional metadata specific to that column

\title{Retrieve options used in bcdata, their value if set and the default value.}
\usage{
bcdc_options()
}
\description{
This function retrieves bcdata specific options that can be set. These options can be set
using \verb{option(\{name of the option\} = \{value of the option\})}. The default options are purposefully
set conservatively to hopefully ensure successful requests. Resetting these options may result in
failed calls to the data catalogue. Options in R are reset every time R is re-started. See examples for
addition ways to restore your initial state.
}
\details{
\code{bcdata.max_geom_pred_size} is the maximum size in bytes of an object used for a geometric operation. Objects
that are bigger than this value will have a bounding box drawn and apply the geometric operation
on that simpler polygon. The \link{bcdc_check_geom_size} function can be used to assess whether a given spatial object
exceed the value of this option. Users can iteratively try to increase the maximum geometric predicate size and see
if the bcdata catalogue accepts the request.

\code{bcdata.chunk_limit} is an option useful when dealing with very large data sets. When requesting large objects
from the catalogue, the request is broken up into smaller chunks which are then recombined after they've
been downloaded. This is called "pagination". bcdata does this all for you but using this option you can set the size of the chunk
requested. On faster internet connections, a bigger chunk limit could be useful while on slower connections,
it is advisable to lower the chunk limit. Chunks must be less than 10000.

\code{bcdata.single_download_limit} is the maximum number of records an object can be before forcing a paginated download
(see entry for \code{bcdata.chunk_limit} for details on pagination).
Tweaking this option in conjunction with \code{bcdata.chunk_limit} can often resolve failures in large and complex downloads.
The default is 10000 records.
