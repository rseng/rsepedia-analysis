An R package üì¶ for searching & retrieving data from the [B.C. Data
Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca).

-   `bcdc_browse()` - Open the catalogue in your default browser
-   `bcdc_search()` - Search records in the catalogue
-   `bcdc_search_facets()` - List catalogue facet search options
-   `bcdc_get_record()` - Print a catalogue record
-   `bcdc_tidy_resources()` - Get a data frame of resources for a record
-   `bcdc_get_data()` - Get catalogue data
-   `bcdc_query_geodata()` - Get & query catalogue geospatial data
    available through a [Web Feature
    Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service)

**Note:** The `bcdata` package supports downloading *most* file types,
including zip archives. It will do its best to identify and read data
from zip files, however if there are multiple data files in the zip, or
data files that `bcdata` doesn‚Äôt know how to import, it will fail. If
you encounter a file type in the B.C. Data Catalogue not currently
supported by `bcdata` please file an
[issue](https://github.com/bcgov/bcdata/issues/).

### Reference

[bcdata package üì¶ home page and reference
guide](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/)

### Installation

You can install `bcdata` directly from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bcdata):

``` r
install.packages("bcdata")
```

To install the development version from GitHub, use the
[remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) package:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("bcgov/bcdata")
library(bcdata)
```

### Vignettes

-   [Get Started with
    bcdata](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/articles/bcdata.html)
-   [Querying Spatial Data with
    bcdata](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/articles/efficiently-query-spatial-data-in-the-bc-data-catalogue.html)
-   [Exploring Silviculture Data with
    bcdata](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/articles/explore-silviculture-data-using-bcdata.html)

### Methods for `bcdc_promise`

The `bcdc_query_geodata()` returns an object of the class
`bcdc_promise`. We have written an ever growing list methods for this
class. You can use these methods directly on a object returned by
`bcdc_query_geodata()`. Here are all the methods for the `bcdc_promise`
class:

-   `as_tibble`
-   `collect`
-   `filter`
-   `head`
-   `mutate`
-   `names`
-   `print`
-   `select`
-   `show_query`
-   `tail`

### BCDC Authentication

If you are an authorized editor of the B.C. Data Catalogue you may want
to access records that are not publicly available (e.g., in DRAFT,
waiting to be published). This can be done by authenticating with the
catalogue with an API key.

***Important Note:*** *Your API key is like a password and you must take
care to keep it private. Do not share it, and be careful to not include
it in any scripts or accidentally commit it to GitHub.*

You can log in to the catalogue to obtain your API key, then store it as
an environment variable in your [`.Renviron`
file](https://rstats.wtf/r-startup.html#renviron). The environment
variable must be called `BCDC_KEY`, set like this:

    BCDC_KEY=your-api-key

This way, the relevant bcdata functions will read that key and use it to
authorize your calls to the catalogue, allowing you to access additional
records that you are authorized to see if you were logged into the
catalogue web interface. Functions that benefit from this are:

-   `bcdc_search()`
-   `bcdc_list()`
-   `bcdc_get_record()`
-   `bcdc_get_data()`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*This project was created using the
[bcgovr](https://github.com/bcgov/bcgovr) package.*
# bcdata (development version)

* Added `bcdc_get_citation` to generate bibliographic entries (via `utils::bibentry`) for individuals records. #273
* Results from `bcdc_search()` (objects of class `"bcdc_recordlist"`) now print 50 records by default, instead of 10. In addition, there is a new `[` method for `"bcdc_recordlist"` objects, allowing you to subset these lists and still have a nice printout (#288).
* Ensure that `bcdc_get_data()` fails informatively when a given resource doesn't exist in a record (#290)


# bcdata 0.3.0

* The [BC Data Catalogue and its API have been updated](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=8A553CABCCDD434D8614D1CA92B03400), requiring changes to the `bcdata` package, most of which are internal only (#283). These should be mostly invisible to the user, except for the removal of the `type` search facet in `bcdc_search()` and `bcdc_search_facets()`. If you use an API key (authorized catalogue editors only), you will need to login to the new catalogue and get your updated key and set the value your `BCDC_KEY` environment variable to the new key.

### IMPROVEMENTS
* Add `names` method for `bcdc.promise` objects. You can now call `names` on an object produced by `bcdc_query_geodata`. This is handy when trying to figure out exact column spelling etc. #278

### BUG FIXES
* Fix bug where sticky column were incorrectly identified in `bcdc_describe_feature` (#279)

# bcdata 0.2.4

* Code in `.onLoad()` that sent a request to the wfs getCapabilities endpoint could cause the package to fail to load. This was moved into an internal function `bcdc_get_capabilities()` that makes the request the first time it's required, and stores the result for the remainder of the session (#271)
* testthat is now used conditionally to only run tests if the testthat package is installed.

# bcdata 0.2.3

### IMPROVEMENTS
- Setting the `bcdata.single_download_limit` limit dynamically from the getCapabilities endpoint. #256
- `bcdc_describe_feature` now joins an object description column to the returned object to provide more information about a field directly in R. #241, #259
- Better documentation and information surrounding the `bcdata.max_geom_pred_size` option. #243, #258 
- Add new function `bcdc_check_geom_size` so users can check prior to submitting a WFS request with `filter` to see 
if the request will require a bounding box conversion. #243, #258
- Better documentation and messaging about when and why paginated requests are required by `bcdc_query_geodata()`. #240, #264
- Better documentation and print method for what records are suitable for use with `bcdc_query_geodata()`. #265, #267

# bcdata 0.2.2
### IMPROVEMENTS
* Added `bcdc_list_groups` and `bcdc_list_group_records` to provide the ability to query on the group endpoint of the catalogue API. #234
* Added new option `bcdata.single_download_limit` to enable setting the maximum number of records an object can be before forcing a paginated download (#252)

### BUG FIXES
* Fixed bug in `collect.bcdc_promise` where the wrong parameter name in `crul::Paginator$new()` resulted in an error in paginated wfs requests (#250, thanks @meztez)
* Fixed a bug where the name of `bcdata.chunk_limit` option had a typo, so that it was not actually used properly (#252)

# bcdata 0.2.1

### BUG FIXES
* Remove link for pipe documentation for simplicity.
* Fixed bug where using many `as.` functions (e.g., `as.Date()`, `as.character()`, `as.numeric()`) in a filter statement would fail. (#218, #219)

### MAINTENANCE
* Updated internal SQL translation to use `DBI` S4 generics (`DBI::dbQuoteIdentifier()` is now used instead of 
  `dbplyr::sql_escape_ident()` and `DBI::dbQuoteString()` instead of `dbplyr::sql_escape_string()`), to comply 
  with upcoming `dbplyr` 2.0 release (#225, #225; https://github.com/tidyverse/dbplyr/issues/385)
* Wrapped all examples that call web resources in `try()` to avoid spurious check failures (#229).

# bcdata 0.2.0

### BREAKING CHANGES
* Rename `selectable` column from `bcdc_describe_feature` to `sticky` and modify corresponding docs and tests (#180).

### IMPROVEMENTS
* Add explore-silviculture-data-using-bcdata vignette/article. h/t @hgriesbauer 
* Add `head` and `tail` methods for `bcdc.promise` objects. Thanks to @hgriesbauer for the suggestion! (#182, #186)
* Provide `as_tibble` as an alias for `collect` in line with `dbplyr` behaviour (#166)
* Geometry predicates can now take a `bbox` object as well as an `sf*` object (#176)
* When reading in excel files, `bcdc_get_data` now outputs a messages indicating the presence and names of any sheets (#190)
* `bcdc_get_data()` & `bcdc_query_geodata()` will now work with full B.C. data catalogue url including resource (#125, #196)
* `bcdc_sf` objects now have an `time_downloaded` attribute
* Authorized B.C. Data Catalogue editors can now authenticate with the catalogue by setting 
a `BCDC_KEY` environment variable with their catalogue API token (https://github.com/bcgov/bcdata#bcdc-authentication; #208).

### BUG FIXES
* Fix `select`, `filter` and `mutate` roxygen so that bcdata specific documentation to these methods is available
* Add tests for attributes

# bcdata 0.1.2

### IMPROVEMENTS
* Add `bcdc_tidy_resources` for retrieving a data frame containing the metadata for all resources from a single B.C. Data Catalogue record (PR#149, #147)
* Add a more decorative record print method  (#73)
* More reliable detection of layer name for a wfs call in `bcdc_query_geodata()` (#129, #138, #139)
* Add `mutate` method for bcdc_promise that only fails and suggest an alternative approach. (PR#134)
* Add back in querying vignette
* Using `tidyselect` so that `select.bcdc_promise` behaviour is typical of `dplyr::select` ($140, #138)
* Using GitHub actions for CI. 

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES
* Remove `BEYOND()` and `RELATE()` geometry predicates as they are currently not fully supported by geoserver
                                                        
### BUG FIXES
* Now precompiling vignettes so that queries are submitted locally and no actually requests are made from CRAN (#151)
* Fix `NOTE: Namespace in Imports field not imported from: ‚Äòmethods‚Äô` error on CRAN (#145)
* Fixed a bug where functions nested inside geometry predicates were not evaluated (#146, #154)
* Fixed a bug where `DWITHIN` wasn't working because `units` needed to be unquoted (#154)
* Fixed a bug where `BBOX()` used in a `filter()` statement combined with `bcdc_query_geodata()` did not work (#135, #137, #131)
* Fixed a bug where layer names with a number in them would not work in `bcdc_query_geodata()` (#126, #127)


# bcdata 0.1.1

* Expand and standardize checking w[ms]f features to make package more resistant to slight warehouse API changes. 
* Data retrieval functions now work with BCGW name (#106)
* Add CITATION file (#104)
* Increased test coverage (#112)
* Skipping all tests on CRAN that require a web connection
* Better and more informative error message when experiencing http failures occur (#121)
* Added print methods for `show_query`
* Change examples to donttest
* Added verbose argument to `bcdc_get_record` to enable suppressing console writing

# bcdata 0.1.0

* Initial Release
