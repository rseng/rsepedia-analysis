# Contributor Code of Conduct

## The Abridged Version

The Bokeh community has been fantastic since the project's start. A one-line summary
of this CoC is simply a reflection of the community values already evident in practice:

> Please be always kind and courteous. There's never a need to be mean or rude or disrespectful.

If you wish to bring something to the attention of the project team, please contact
[conduct@bokeh.org](mailto:conduct@bokeh.org)

## The Longer Version

However, for the sake of decreasing any ambiguity, the details of this CoC are laid out explicitly
here.

### Our Pledge

We pledge to take responsibility for our own actions. If someone has been harmed
or offended, we will listen carefully and respectfully, and work to right the
wrong. In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

All of these serve to help the make the project better, but also serve to make
the experience of participating in the project better as well.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Sexist, racist, and other exclusionary language.
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment or intimidation
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. Maintainers will seek input
from all parties following any reports in order to make final determinations,
and will encourage relevant individuals to right any harms committed to the
extent possible.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or otherwise harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project work spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [conduct@bokeh.org](mailto:conduct@bokeh.org). All
reports will be reviewed by the [Conduct Sub-committee](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/wiki/BEP-4:-Project-Roles#conduct-sub-committee) and investigated and any appropriate measures
will be taken. The project team commits to maintaining confidentiality
with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific
enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith will face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

### Escalation

In the event it is necessary to make a report involving someone on the NumFocus committee itself, please use the general [NumFocus CoC reporting form](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct).

### Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4,
available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4][version]

# Bokeh Examples

## Examples in this repository

This directory contains many examples of different ways to use Bokeh. As Bokeh has been evolving
fast, it is important that you **ensure that the version of an example you're looking at matches
the version of Bokeh you are running**.

### [`app`](app/)

This directory contains examples of Bokeh Apps, which are simple and easy to create web applications for data visualization or exploration.

### [`custom`](custom/)

The content of this directory demonstrate how to add custom extensions to Bokeh. Check project's documentation [page](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/extensions.html)

### [`embed`](embed/)

This directory includes examples that show how to embed Bokeh plots and widget in HTML documents.

### [`howto`](howto/)

The examples in this directory are mini-tutorials that demonstrate and explain
some  particular aspect of Bokeh capability (such as [linking and
brushing](http://www.infovis-wiki.net/index.php?title=Linking_and_Brushing)),
or walk through a particular example in additional detail.


### [`models`](models/)

This directory contains examples that use the lowest-level
[`bokeh.models`](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/reference/models.html)
interface. For more information about Bokeh models see [the concepts section of
the user_guide](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/concepts.html)

### [`plotting`](plotting/)

This directory contains example using the
[`bokeh.plotting`](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/plotting.html)
interface. There are three subdirectories illustrating output in three
different modes:

* `file` examples that output to static HTML files

* `notebook` examples that display inline in [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebooks

* `server` examples that send output to a Bokeh server, using the python client library for the server

### [`webgl`](webgl/)

This directory contains examples that demonstrate the various glyphs that have
support for WebGL rendering. Most of these examples have a testing purpose, e.g.
to compare the appearance of the WebGL glyph with its regular appearance, or to
test another aspect of WebGL (e.g. blending of transparent glyphs).


## Other sources for examples

* There are many examples in the [Bokeh Gallery](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html) on main documentation site https://docs.bokeh.org.

* The [Bokeh User's Guide](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide.html) has many plots with corresponding code samples throughout.

* Many examples of Bokeh being used with the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebook, including a set or tutorial notebooks, are collected in the [`bokeh-notebooks`](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh-notebooks) repository. Live versions of these notebooks [can be run online on MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bokeh/bokeh-notebooks/master?filepath=tutorial%2F00%20-%20Introduction%20and%20Setup.ipynb). These notebooks are also available statically rendered on the [Bokeh NBViewer page](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bokeh/bokeh-notebooks/blob/master/index.ipynb).
# Custom Extension Examples

The examples in the this directory all demonstrate how to add custom extensions
to Bokeh. There are some additional examples in other directories:

* app/surface3d

More detailed documentation on creating custom extensions can be found here:

https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/extensions.html
This example uses a custom extension, which requires compilation before
the example can be run. Issue ``bokeh build .`` to build the extension.
This directory contains examples that demonstrate how to embed Bokeh plots and widgets as
DOM elements of larger documents. Typically, this is accomplished using the [`bokeh.embed`](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/embed.html) interface.
This example demonstrates usage of ``server_session`` to customize a Bokeh
app session before embedding in a web page. To run, first execute the this
command to start the Bokeh server:

    bokeh serve --port 5100 --allow-websocket-origin localhost:8080 --allow-websocket-origin 127.0.0.1:8080 bokeh_app.py

Then, in another execute the following command to start the Flask app:

    python serve.py

Now, navigate your browser to localhost:8080
To run this demo start the Bokeh server application:

    bokeh serve bokeh_server.py --allow-websocket-origin=127.0.0.1:5000

And then in a seprate window execute:

    python flask_server.py

Then navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000
# Bokeh Plotting Examples

The example in this directory all use the [`bokeh.plotting`](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/plotting.html)
interface. This interface is primarily centered around creating a reasonable default plot with
appropriate axes and tools, to which you can add different visual glyphs whose properties are
associated with your data. A simple, but typical complete example of this API looks like:

    from bokeh.plotting import figure, output_file, show

    p = figure()
    p.circle([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], color="orange")

    output_file("foo.html")

    show(p)

The [`file`](/file)  subdirectory contains examples that output to static HTML files
# Bokeh Models Examples

This directory contains examples that use the lowest-level
[`bokeh.models`](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/concepts.html#bokeh-models)
interface. This interface mirrors the models found in the BokehJS browser
library, and provides complete control over every aspect of constructing a
Bokeh document, at the expense of increased verbosity.

Most users will probably want to start off with the higher level
[`bokeh.plotting`](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/plotting.html)
interface,and only selectively use the
[`bokeh.models`](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/concepts.html#bokeh-models)
interface whenever a particular need arises.

#### Examples that use the server

Any examples in this directory whose filenames contain `_animate` or `_server` make use of the Bokeh
server, and you must first start the Bokeh server to view them. To start the server, execute:

    bokeh serve

in a separate command window or terminal.
The examples in this directory show off various kinds of interactions that are easily
possible using Bokeh, including:

* linked panning/zooming
* linked selection brushing
* hover tooltips
* controlling range bounds
* updating date from an AJAX data source
* using JS callbacks for range updates, widgets, etc.

as well as show more detailed walkthroughs of some specific examples.
# Bokeh Authentication Hooks

This example demonstrates the use of authentication hooks with the Bokeh server.
To run, execute the following command:

    bokeh serve --enable-xsrf-cookies --auth-module=auth.py  app.py
### `flask_embed.py`

Run with `python flask_embed.py` and open http://localhost:8000/ in a web browser.

### `flask_gunicorn_embed.py`

Run with `gunicorn -w 4 flask_gunicorn_embed:app`

A UNIX environment is required to run this script.

### `notebook_embed.ipynb`

requires [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

### `standalone_embed.py`

Run with `python standalone_embed.py`.

On Windows, the `num_procs=4` argument must be removed from the Server initialisation call on line 34.

### `tornado_embed.py`

Run with `python tornado_embed.py`.

On Windows, the `num_procs=4` argument must be removed from the Server initialisation call on line 47.
Install django, panel and channels (pip only) and run:

```sh
./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

then navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:8000/shape_viewer>, <http://127.0.0.1:8000/sea_surface>, or <http://127.0.0.1:8000/sea_surface_with_template>.
The examples in this directory illustrate the use of some tools that can assist in the
development of bokeh plots.  Currently this includes:

* a tool for constructing the directed graph of submodels of a bokeh model
and drawing that graph to illuminate the model structure. Run

```
$ python structure_graph.py
```

The [jupyter notebook](./ModelStructureExample.ipynb) illustrates this and gives a look
into some of the private methods that provide the information that builds the structure graph.
Examples in this directory show off bokeh's capability to integrate with Jupyer widgets
outside of JupyerLab or classical Notebook environments. All examples are bokeh server
examples, so you run them with `bokeh server app_name`, and then you have to navigate
to `http://localhost:5006/app_name`:

* `ipyvolume_camera.py` -- shows how to integrate a thridparty widget and manipulate it
with Bokeh's and IPyWidgets' controls.

* `ipyleaflet_tiles.py` -- IPyLeaflet and Bokeh's tile renderer side-by-side.
# Bokeh Applications

The examples in this directory all make use of the Bokeh server, to create data visualization web apps from simple
python scripts.

To run any of these examples, execute `bokeh serve --show` and the name of the script or directory that contains the
demo. For example,

    bokeh serve --show sliders.py

will run the "sliders" demo, and open it up in a new browser tab.

# Bokeh WebGL examples

This directory contains examples that demonstrate the various glyphs that have
support for WebGL rendering. Most of these examples have a testing purpose, e.g.
to compare the appearance of the WebGL glyph with its regular appearance, or to
test another aspect of WebGL (e.g. blending of transparent glyphs).


### Examples meant for testing

* line_compare.py - to compare regular and webgl lines (stipling, joins, caps)
* marker_compare.py - to compare regular and webgl markers
* line10k.py - uses the webgl line glyph to plot a relatively large dataset
* scatter10k.py - uses the webgl circle glyph and selections
* iris_blend.py - to test color names and blending of semi-transparent glyphs


### Other WebGL examples in this directory

* clustering.py - a clustering example based on scikit-learn that produces
  a large amount of points (calculation takes a while)

=========================================================================

BokehJS is a front-end JavaScript library for [Bokeh](http://github.com/bokeh/bokeh).

The architecture of the library facilitates easy manipulation of the components
and configuration of a plot from server-side code in python or other languages.
However, BokehJS can also be used directly as a standalone JavaScript library,
with plot data embedded directly into the page, retrieved via AJAX calls, or
supplied by a separate Bokeh Plot server.

Building
--------

Please refer to the [BokehJS section](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/dev_guide/bokehjs.html)
of the [Bokeh Contributor Guide](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/dev_guide.html)
for information about building, testing and demoing BokehJS.

Contributing
------------

We always appreciate feedback and value contributions.  The core developers are
working hard towards applying Bokeh and BokehJS towards some specific projects,
so the development priorities will tend to center around those tasks, until the
project reaches a point of stability.

Please join the discussion on the [Bokeh project Discourse](https://discourse.bokeh.org).
Please consult https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/dev_guide.html for more
information about contributing to BokehJS.
