# Welcome to fishRman [![DOI](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03467/status.svg)](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.03467)
`fishRman` is an Open-Source Shiny R Dashboard to easily query, download, analyse and visualise Global Fishing Watch data on fishing effort. 

## Useful links
You can use the dashboard and learn more about the code, the software, the data, and the people behind them via:

- The [**Handbook**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shyentist/fish-r-man/main/www/doc/Handbook.pdf) constitutes `fishRman`'s official instructions for use. Regardless of the prior knowledge of the user, reading the **Handbook** is key to the correct usage of the software.
- Website of [**Open-Source for Marine and Ocean Sciences (OSMOS)**](https://osmos.xyz/), which is our research group. If you like our projects, and would like a more interactive role, consider joining our [**Discord server**](https://discord.com/invite/W2unKxKbp7), following us on [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/osmos_xyz), or [**donating**](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/osmos).

## How to become a contributor
First things first, you might want to take a look at the Issues page. There, I listed some tasks that I reckon the project needs. If you don't find anything that you can do, you can still run the code and make up **your own** opinion on what is needed. From there, you can either file this new Issue and forget about it, or file it and handle it yourself. The pull requests should be made onto the `pull-requests` branch.

# Summary
One of the burdens of fisheries scientists is the scarcity or lack of consistent, 
extensive data on the subject. When such data do exist, they are often only available:

- To universities or other research institutions;
- Through bureaucratic ordeals;
- For a fee.

This issue has been tackled by Global Fishing Watch, an independent, international, 
non-profit organization promoting ocean sustainability through greater transparency, 
visualizing, tracking and sharing data about global fishing activity for free [@GFW].

While the datasets are indeed publicly available, they are also rather large and quite 
difficult to manage, since they require proficiency in coding. In fact, at present, the 
most notable reading material instructing on the use of the datasets targets an audience 
who is proficient in the languages R [@ClavelleR], Python, JavaScript [@ClavelleGEE], or 
SQL [@Mayorga] to download, filter, summarise, and visualise the data.


# Statement of need
Life sciences will soon need a widespread integration of computational approaches to store, 
manage, analyse, and visualise datasets that are quickly growing in size and complexity [@carey]. 
This is rather concerning, given how, although the number of published papers reporting the 
use of the R statistical language [@R] increased fivefold from 2007 to 2018 in the field of ecology 
[@lai],  most life science majors do not offer basic programming courses [@mariano].

Designed with ease of use in mind, `fishRman` is intended for a public of researchers,
students, managers, and stakeholders in the fields of fisheries science, life sciences, 
and economics, with little to no proficiency in programming, data analysis, or both, who
intend to query, download, filter, analyse, and visualise Global Fishing Watch data. 

Users who can program in R may also benefit from the software to avoid writing lines of code 
for  what has already been implemented in the dashboard, in order to focus on other aspects 
of their research, or even customize the source code to better meet their specific needs.

Users with a deeper understanding of statistics and fisheries science, and with prior knowledge 
of the datasets, only need to get acquainted with the software, while users that are new to the 
field can easily learn what they need to know via `fishRman`â€™s official instructions for use, the 
Handbook. Regardless of the prior knowledge of the user, reading the Handbook, which is available 
in the software itself and in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Shyentist/fish-r-man), is 
key to the correct usage of the software.

The user-friendly interface [@shiny; @shinyBS; @shinyjs; @shinyWidgets] allows users to 
easily interact with the SQL query constructor, seamlessly building [@glue; @stringi; @countrycode]
and running queries [@bigrquery; @DBI]. In a few clicks, users are able to analyse retrieved 
data in several different ways, such as:

- visualising the top n-th percentile of the dataframe for any percentage [@viridis; @sf; @maps; @ggplot], 
a key passage in assessing how fishing effort overlaps fishing stocks, protected or restricted areas, or 
another country's jurisdiction. 
- calculating the fishing effort exerted by specific countries via certain geartypes, in precise areas. This
is vital in assessing who is fishing where, when, and how they are doing it, so that fisheries management plans can
address the right issues even at an international level with a clear understanding of each country's responsibilities.
- producing time series of fishing effort with a daily, monthly, or yearly frequency [@dplyr; @tidyverse], which
is indispensable when searching for patterns to compare to species' life-cycles, seafood prices over the years,
compliance to maritime and market laws, and overall consistency with data from third-parties.
