# Summary

## Introduction

XLUR is a Python toolbox for ArcGIS Pro (v2.2.4 or higher, Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), Redlands, CA)
that enables the development and application of land use regression models via a wizard style interface. 
Land use regression (LUR) is a commonly used technique in environmental sciences to analyse factors influencing pollutant levels 
and to predict pollutant levels at unmeasured locations. LUR is extensively used 
in studies on air pollution exposure [@Molter:2010a;@Molter:2010b], but it is widely applicable and has been used in 
fields ranging from water pollution [@Kelsey:2004] to urban climatology [@Heusinkveld:2014]. 

## Purpose of the software

The traditional approach to the development of a LUR model requires several steps: 
1. The creation of a point dataset of known observation data for a variable of interest (such as nitrogen dioxide concentrations or air temperatures), which will be used as outcome variables.
2. Carrying out various spatial analyses of additional geospatial data with these point locations using geographic information systems (GIS) to extract potential predictor variables.
3. Data wrangling of extracted data from steps 1 and 2 into a format that can be readily used by statistical software packages.
4. Carrying out multiple regression analysis to obtain a best fit parsimonious model.

If done manually, steps 2 to 4 are repetitive and time consuming, making them inefficient and prone to error. 
XLUR provides a wizard style interface that guides a user 
through the development of a LUR model without the need to access and run multiple tools and 
additional software packages. XLUR largely automates steps 2 to 4, which significantly speeds
up the model development process and reduces user error. Depending on the type and amount of data to be processed, 
and the available hardware, models can be developed in less than one hour. Furthermore, 
the output files produced by XLUR ensure that the model development is 
well documented and reproducible. Lastly, XLUR also makes the method available for a wider range of users.  

In addition to developing LUR models, XLUR can also apply a previously developed 
model to a new set of locations within the same study area. New locations can be
defined by the user or can be based on a dataset containing regularly located points or randomly located points. 
Again, XLUR largely automates this process with minimal effort from the user. 

XLUR is aimed at GIS specialists. It uses the ArcGIS Pro software, which is the most widely 
used commercial GIS software worldwide. XLUR is based on the LUR methodology used in the 
European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) [@Beelen:2013;@Eeftens:2012] as set out in the ESCAPE Exposure 
assessment manual [@escape]. Within air pollution research the ESCAPE methodology is used as
the standard for developing LUR models. XLUR also allows hybrid LUR models to be developed, based on an extension 
of the ESCAPE methodology that included the addition of satellite derived data and data from chemical transport 
models [@deHoogh:2016]. 

## Current application

XLUR has been developed through the NERC Newton-DIPI funded Urban hybriD models for AiR pollution exposure Assessment (UDARA)
study, which is a collaboration between the University of Manchester and Institut Teknologi
Bandung. This study aims to develop air pollution prediction models for Indonesian urban areas and to analyse 
the effects of air pollution on health indicators provided by the Indonesian Family Life Survey.

## State of the field

Currently, only a small number of LUR software packages have been developed. RLUR [@Morley:2018] has been developed in the 
R programming language and is aimed at users with a background in statistical analyses, such as exposure scientists 
or epidemiologists. PyLUR [@Ma:2020] is written in Python, but not implemented within the ArcGIS software. Instead, 
it uses GDAL/OGR libraries for spatial analysis. The authors report that PyLUR currently does not have a user-friendly 
graphic user interface (GUI) and at the time of writing it is not available in an open source repository. OpenLUR 
[@Lautenschlager:2020] is designed to develop LUR models exclusively based on OpenStreetMap data. Unlike the XLUR, RLUR, 
and PyLUR software packages, the OpenLUR software package does not use the ESCAPE methodology, but an unsupervised machine 
learning process featuring automated hyper-parameter tuning. 

One major difference between these LUR software packages and XLUR is that they are designed specifically for air 
pollution models, i.e. their spatial analyses only extract potential predictors relevant for air pollution modelling. In 
contrast, XLUR is more widely applicable and its wizard style interface can be used to extract potential predictor variables
for a range of environmental phenomena. Another major difference is that XLUR can develop classic LUR models and hybrid LUR
models, that add a measure of global variability to the measures of local variability modelled in LUR. Furthermore, XLUR is
the only software that is implemented within ArcGIS Pro.   

## Availability and implementation

XLUR is a Python toolbox for use within ArcGIS Pro [@ArcGISPro]. An ArcGIS Pro Project file (XLUR.aprx) containing the XLUR toolbox is available on the GitHub repository (https://github.com/anmolter/XLUR). The repository also provides the source code of the tools, a user manual, an example dataset for the tutorial in the user manual, and example outputs. The user manual contains instructions for installing additional Python packages (wxpython, statsmodels, seaborn, patsy) required by XLUR via ArcGIS Pro's Python Package Manager.

# Installation

System requirements: Windows 10, ArcGIS Pro v2.2.4 or higher, License
for Spatial Analyst extension if analysis of raster data is required

XLUR uses a number of Python modules/packages; however, most of these
are Python base modules or are pre-installed with ArcGIS Pro (see the
[repository](https://github.com/anmolter/XLUR/blob/master/Packages.md)
for a list of the required packages). Only four additional packages need
to be installed. In ArcGIS Pro this can be done using the Python Package
Manager. Follow these steps to install additional Python packages:

1.  Open ArcGIS Pro. Click the About ArcGIS Pro button in the bottom
    left corner (denoted by the red arrow in the screenshot below). *In
    ArcGIS Pro v.2.3 this button is called Settings.*

![](Images\manager1.jpg)

1.  In the menu on the left hand side click Python. This will open the
    Python Package Manager. Click the Manage Environments button.

![](Images\manager2a.jpg)

1.  This will open the Manage Environments window. Since additional
    packages cannot be installed in the default environment, you will
    need to clone the default environment. Ensure that the default
    environment is selected (this is typically called ‘arcgispro-py3’),
    then click clone.

![](Images\manager3.jpg)

Creating the cloned environment may take a while, a blue line at the
bottom of the window indicates that the process is still running. Once
the clone has been created, click the radio button to make it the active
environment. Click Close, then Exit ArcGIS Pro and restart it for the
changes to take effect.

![](Images\manager3_1.jpg)

1.  Restart ArcGIS Pro, click on About ArcGIS Pro, then click on Python
    in the menu on the left hand side. Under Project Environment you
    should see the name of the cloned environment. *If you do not see
    the name of the cloned environment, repeat step 3 being careful not
    to exit the programme until the clone has been created.* Click Add
    Packages.

![](Images\manager4.jpg)

This opens the Add Packages interface. In the Search box type patsy. The
patsy package should appear in the list below. Select the patsy package
and click Install.

![](Images\manager4a.jpg)

This will open the Install Package window. Tick the box in the bottom
left to agree to the terms and conditions, then click Install.

![](Images\manager4b.jpg)

The installation may take a while. Once the installation is finished,
the list underneath Add Packages will refresh. If you scroll down the
list, you will see that patsy is no longer on it (because it has been
installed). If you want to check that the package has been installed,
click on Installed Packages. If you scroll down the list of installed
packages, patsy should be listed.

1.  Repeat step 4 for the following packages:

-   statsmodels

![](Images\manager4c.jpg)

-   seaborn

![](Images\manager4d.jpg)

-   wxpython

![](Images\manager4e.jpg)

1.  If you are planning to use raster data in your analysis, click on
    Licensing in the menu on the left hand side. Under Esri Extensions
    check that Spatial Analyst is licensed.

2.  Click the back arrow in the menu on the left hand side. Click Open
    another project, browse to the XLUR.aprx ArcGIS Pro Project file and
    double-click to open it. The XLUR.aprx file can be found in the XLUR
    folder in the XLUR repository. In the Catalog window double-click
    Toolboxes, then double-click XLUR.tbx. This will open the XLUR
    toolbox, which contains the BuildLUR and ApplyLUR scripts. Running
    either of these script will open the Build LUR or Apply LUR wizard,
    respectively.

# General Information

## What is LUR?

**Classic LUR**

Land use regression (LUR) is a statistical method, which uses geospatial
data to develop prediction models in environmental sciences. It is
predominantly used in air pollution research to predict pollutant
concentrations empirically within a given a study area. However, it has
also been used for other environmental phenomena such as noise, air
temperature and water microbiology.

The underlying principle of LUR is that a measured quantity
(e.g. pollutant concentration, noise level, temperature etc) at a given
location depends on characteristics of the surrounding environment, in
particular on the presence and absence of sources and sinks, which
increase and decrease values respectively.

LUR models are developed by using measured data from a number of
monitoring sites as the dependent variable and data on the surrounding
environment extracted as potential predictor variables in a multiple
linear regression analysis. For example, in an air pollution study
particulate matter concentrations might be measured at fifty monitoring
sites. Then for each monitoring site potential predictor variables are
extracted such as the area of industrial land use around the monitoring
site, the distance to the nearest road, the number of motor vehicles on
the nearest road etc. The particulate matter concentrations and the
potential predictors are entered into a supervised machine learning
process, which will try to construct a parsimonious multiple linear
regression model. This model can then be used to predict particulate
matter concentrations at any point within the study area.

The supervised machine learning process is based on the methodology used
in the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE),
which can be downloaded from
<http://www.escapeproject.eu/manuals/ESCAPE_Exposure-manualv9.pdf> (a
copy can be found in the Documentation folder). The ESCAPE exposure
manual provides a detailed description of the steps required to
construct a parsimonious multiple linear regression model; therefore,
only a brief summary is presented here:

1.  Prior to the statistical analysis a positive or negative direction
    of effect is assigned to each potential predictor variable by the
    user based on *a priori* knowledge of the subject area.
2.  Using the dependent variable univariate linear regression models are
    created for each potential predictor variable. The linear regression
    models are ranked by their adjusted R<sup>2</sup> value. The model
    with the highest adjusted R<sup>2</sup> and in which the coefficient
    of the predictor variable matches the assigned direction of effect
    (see previous step) is selected as the starting model.  
3.  The remaining potential predictor variables are added to the
    starting model one by one. The new linear regression models are
    ranked by by their adjusted R<sup>2</sup> value. The model with the
    highest adjusted R<sup>2</sup> and in which the coefficients of all
    predictor variables match the assigned direction of effects is
    selected. If the adjusted R<sup>2</sup> of this model has increased
    by more than 1% compared to the previous model, it is used as the
    new model. If not, the variable selection process stops and the
    previous model is used as the intermediate model. Using these
    selection criteria potential predictor variables are added to the
    model until the increase in adjusted R<sup>2</sup> becomes less than
    1% or until no potential predictor variables are left. The resulting
    model is the intermedite model.
4.  The predictor variables included in the intermediate model are
    inspected. If all predictor variables are statistically significant
    (p&lt;0.1), the intermediate model becomes the final model. If
    non-significant (p&gt;0.1) predictors are present in the
    intermediate model, predictor variables are removed from the
    intermediate model until all predictor variables are statistically
    significant and their coefficients still match the assigned
    direction of effect. The resulting model will become the final
    model.

XLUR will provide a range of diagnosics for the final model which can be
used to further analyse the suitability and robustness of the final
model.

**Hybrid LUR**

Hybrid models can also be developed. Hybrid models in XLUR are based on
an extension of the ESCAPE methodology developed by de Hoogh et al. (see
[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2016.07.005](DOI:%2010.1016/j.envres.2016.07.005)).
In the XLUR tool a hybrid model is a model in which one or more
mandatory variables are selected by the user. These mandatory variables
are forced into the model prior to the starting model, regardless of the
amount of variance that they explain or their direction of effect. Once
the mandatory variables have been entered potential predictor variables
are added and models are selected in the same way as described for the
Classic LUR model. It should be noted that mandatory variables will not
be removed during step 4 described above. They will remain in the model
regardless of their sigficance level.

An example of this would be using the output from dispersion models run
at a coarse spatial resolution as a mandatory variable, which could add
a measure of global variability to the measures of local variability
used in LUR.

## The XLUR Wizard

The XLUR wizard guides the user through building and applying LUR models
from within the ArcGIS software. The user must complete each input field
in the wizard starting at the top of the page and then moving downwards.
The statusbar at the bottom of wizard indicates if an input field is
ready for an entry or if it is currently being processed. *Some inputs
may take a while to be processed.* Once an input has been completed a
green tick mark will appear next to it. Clicking on the question mark
button next to each section heading will open a help window with further
information on how to complete each section. The user may exit the
wizard at any time by clicking on the Cancel button; however, all
progress made in the wizard will be lost.

The wizard window can be resized by dragging the sides or by clicking on
the maximise button in the title bar.

![](Images\wizard_features.png)

There are three types of windows that may appear during the process of
completing the wizard.

### Information Windows

![](Images\example_info.jpg)

Information windows simply confirm a choice made by the user. They are
non-critical.

### Warning Windows

![](Images\example_warning.jpg)

A warning window highlights a potential problem in the dataset selected
by the user. This problem may be critical or non-critical and it is up
to the user to decide whether to proceed.

### Error Windows

![](Images\example_error.jpg)

An error window indicates that an incorrect entry has been made into an
input field, that an invalid selection has been made or that a dataset
has a critical problem. This is a critical problem and needs to be
addressed before proceeding with the wizard. In some cases, for example
if the dataset has a critical problem, the user may need to exit the
wizard, address the problem and then start afresh.

## How does XLUR work?

XLUR is written in Python. It consists of two script tools, BuildLUR and
ApplyLUR, which are stored in the XLUR toolbox in the XLUR project. The
diagram below provides an overview of the architecture and process flow
associated with each tool.

![](Images\architecture.png)

# Data Preparation

It is essential to prepare the data carefully prior to using XLUR. XLUR
will carry out some very basic checks of the data, i.e. it will check
that features are located within the study area and if necessary display
a warning message. **XLUR will not clean or prepare the data for use in
the BuildLUR wizard.** Users should carefully check all feature classes
and raster files that they intend to use. In particular, feature classes
should be checked for spatial duplicates (e.g. using the Find Identical
and Delete Identical tools) and invalid geometries (e.g. using the Check
Geometry and Repair Geometry tools).

To be used by the BuildLUR tool all feature classes and raster files
must be stored in **the same File Geodatabase**.

The following tabs show further information for different input
datasets.

## Study Area

The file geodatabase must contain a **polygon feature class** that
represents the boundaries of the study area.

This feature class **must contain**:

-   exactly one feature, which as a minimum encompasses all of the
    monitoring sites.

Typically, a feature class of administrative boundaries is used to
define the study area. For example, the red polygon below shows the
boundary of the Greater Manchester administrative area. If no such
feature class is available, it can be created, either manually or by
using the Minimum Bounding Geometry Tool.

![](Images\GM_area.jpg)

## Dependent Variable

The file geodatabase must contain a **point feature class** of the
monitoring sites, which will be used as the dependent variable when
building the LUR model. Each row in this feature class must be a unique
location, i.e. there must be no spatial duplicates.

The point feature class **must contain**:

-   a text field with a unique identifier for each monitoring site.

-   one or more numeric fields with monitored values (e.g. pollutant
    concentrations, temperatures, bacterial counts).

The table below shows an example of an attribute table of a monitoring
sites feature class. The feature class may contain other fields. These
will be ignored during the analysis, but they may slow down the
performance of the XLUR tools.

![](Images\Example_DepVar.jpg)

## Predictor Variables

Predictor variables can be derived from both vector data and raster
data. Multiple predictor variables can be derived from a single vector
dataset, depending on additional criteria such as the number of buffers,
attribute categories and aggregation methods. In contrast, only a single
predictor can be derived from a raster dataset. To build a LUR model,
typically hundreds of potential predictor variables are extracted and
then assessed in the statistical analysis. Technically, the BuildLUR
tool can be run with only one predictor, but the resulting model will be
very limited.

### Vector maps

From vector data predictor variables can be extracted based on circular
buffers around the monitoring sites or based on the distance to the
nearest feature. Each of these methods can be applied to polygon, line
or point vector data.

#### Buffer based Predictors

XLUR will draw one or more circular buffers around each monitoring site
(the radius of the buffer is determined by the user). It will then use
the Intersect tool to extract features and their associated attributes
from a polygon, line or point feature class selected by the user.
Geometric attributes are automatically recalculated.

This feature class **must contain**:

-   a text field which identifies the category that each feature belongs
    to. For example, a polygon feature class of land use would contain a
    text field that identifies which land use category
    (e.g. residential, commercial, industrial) each polygon feature
    belongs to. A road feature class would contain a text field that
    identifies the road type (e.g. motorway, primary, secondary) of each
    line feature. A tree feature class might contain a text field that
    shows the species of each point feature. The text of the category
    field will be used as part of the variable naming schema, for
    details of the name schema see Step 3 - Predictors. It is strongly
    recommended to only use alphanumeric characters in the text of the
    category field. Non-alphanumeric characters can cause problems and
    may stop XLUR from running. Please note that the BuildLUR tool will
    remove any whitespace and punctuation from the category field,
    before using it.

![](Images\Example_Buffer1.png)

If the features of the feature class cannot be categorised, then a text
field should be used in which all features have the same value. For
example, a polygon feature class of population density would not need a
category; therefore a “dummy” text field should be added with identical
values. In a line feature class of roads it may also be useful to
analyse all roads as well as roads by category, therefore to this
feature class an additional text field could be added in which all
fields are set to “all”. The tables below show some examples of “dummy”
category fields.

![](Images\Example_Buffer2.png)

The feature class **may contain**:

-   one or more numeric fields showing attribute values for each
    feature. If the chosen aggregation method is total area, total
    length or point count, a numeric field is not required. However, if
    the chosen aggregation method is area weighted value, area\*value,
    length weighted value, length\*value, sum of values, mean of values
    or median of values, then the feature class must contain at least
    one numeric field (see *Build LUR Step 3 - Predictors* for further
    information on aggregation methods). For example, a line feature
    class of roads may contain one or more fields showing traffic counts
    for each feature (line segment or row in the attribute table). A
    point feature class of chimney stacks may contain a field showing
    emission rates for each feature. The attribute tables below show
    some examples of value fields.

![](Images\Example_Buffer3.png)

#### Distance based Predictors

XLUR will identify the nearest polygon, line or point feature to each
monitoring site point location from a feature class selected by the user
The nearest feature is based on the Euclidean (straight line) distance
and is expressed in the map units defined by the coordinate system
specified the BuildLUR tool. Depending on the chosen method it will
calculate the distance to the nearest feature, provide the value of an
attribute of the nearest feature (e.g. traffic flow) or calculate a
combination of these two.

The feature class **may contain**:

-   one or more numeric fields showing attribute values for each
    feature. If the chosen method is distance, inverse distance or
    inverse distance squared, then a numeric field is not required.
    However, if the chosen method is value, value\*distance,
    value\*inverse distance or value\*inverse distance squared, then the
    feature class must contain at least one numeric field. For example,
    a line feature class of roads may contain one or more fields showing
    traffic counts for each feature (line segment or row in attribute
    table). A point feature class of chimney stacks may contain a field
    showing emission rates for each feature. The attribute tables below
    show some examples of value fields.

### Raster maps

From raster data only the value of the raster cell that is spatially
coincident with the monitoring site point can be extracted. Since
standard raster grids can only hold one value per cell, no table schema
is required.

# Build LUR

To create a new LUR model double-click the BuildLUR script in the XLUR
toolbox. The BuildLUR tool will appear in the Geoprocessing pane. Click
the Run button in the bottom right corner to run the tool.

![](Images\build_tool.jpg)

This will open the BuildLUR wizard. The wizard will guide you through
the process of creating a LUR model by using the following steps:

## Step 1 - Settings

This step is required to specify some general settings to build a LUR
model.

</h1>
<h2 style="font-size:125%;font-weight:normal;">
Enter WKID number
</h2>
<p>
The user must specify a <strong>projected</strong> coordinate system for
the data. The wizard will automatically create a feature dataset called
<em>LURdata</em> inside the <em>\[Project
name\]\_\[Date\_Time\].gdb</em> file geodatabase. The specified
coordinate system will be used as the spatial reference for the
<em>LURdata</em> feature datatset. Feature classes selected during step
2 (Outcomes) and step 3 (Predictors) of the wizard will be imported into
the <em>LURdata</em> feature dataset prior to analysis. This ensures
that all feature classes used in the analysis have the same spatial
reference. Raster files will be projected into the specified coordinate
system prior to analysis, due to the fact that they cannot be imported
into a feature dataset.
</p>
<p>
ESRI uses the Well-Known ID (WKID) to define the spatial reference. Use
<a href="https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/map/projections/pdf/projected_coordinate_systems.pdf">this
link</a> to find the WKID of the projected coordinate system of your
choice. For example the British National Grid is WKID:27700.
</p>
<p>
Click the <span
style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#040404; background-color:#C4C4C4; padding:0px 2px">OK</span>
button. If a valid WKID has been entered, the name of the selected
coordinate system will be shown. Click the <span
style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#040404; background-color:#C4C4C4; padding:0px 2px">OK</span>
button and a green tick mark will appear.
</p>
<p style="border:2px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000;background-color:#ffcccc; padding:5px">
The unit of the coordinate system will determine the unit of the buffer
distances. For example, if the coordinate system is defined in metres,
then the buffer distances need to be specified in metres. If the
coordinate system is defined in feet, then the buffer distances need to
be specified in feet.

Tick all fields that contain monitored data and that you would like to
develop a model for. These fields will be used as the dependent variable
in the statistical analysis. Individual models will be developed for
each dependent variable, i.e. if you tick more than one field, the
corresponding number of models will be developed. Click the <span

automatically added and will be called <em>p\_XCOORD</em> and
<em>p\_YCOORD</em>.
</p>
<p>
If this step is completed successfully, a green tick mark will appear

<!--/html_preserve-->

## Step 3 - Predictors

In this step the predictor or independent variables of the regression
analysis are specified.

Predictor variables can be derived from vector data and from raster
data. From vector data predictor variables can be extracted based on
circular buffers around the monitoring site point locations or based on
the distance to the nearest feature. Since vector data can be polygons,
lines or points, this results in six possible types of predictor
variables. From raster data only the value of the raster cell that is
spatially coincident with the monitoring site point can be extracted,
adding one more possible type of predictor. Therefore, in total seven
types of predictor variables can be extracted and entered into the
statistical analysis. Each type of variable can produce multiple
predictors, depending on additional settings such as the number of
buffer distances, the number of categories within a feature class, or
the aggregation/extraction method specified.

![](Images\Predictors.jpg)

### Buffer based Predictors

#### Polygon Area or Value within Buffer

For this type of variable a polygon feature class should be used, which
has a spatial extent that is larger than: the study area + the largest
buffer distance. The polygon feature class should not contain duplicates
or invalid geometries (if uncertain about invalid geometries, run the
Repair Geometries tool prior to running the wizard). The polygon feature
class must contain a text field, which identifies a category for each
polygon. If the feature class contains only one category, a dummy text
field should be created with all rows set to the same value.

**Polygon Area within Buffer**

<img src="Images\PolyInBuffer_MultCategories.jpg" width="500px" height="500px" />

This example diagram is based on a polygon feature class with four
categories (A,B,C,D). For a given buffer distance the wizard will
calculate the total area (in the squared map unit of the projected
coordinate system) of each category within the buffer, e.g.

-   Total area of category A = Area of A<sub>1</sub> + Area of
    A<sub>2</sub> + Area A<sub>3</sub>
-   Total area of category B = Area of B<sub>1</sub> + Area of
    B<sub>2</sub> + Area B<sub>3</sub>
-   Total area of category C = Area of C<sub>1</sub> + Area of
    C<sub>2</sub> + Area C<sub>3</sub>
-   Total area of category D = Area of D<sub>1</sub> + Area of
    D<sub>2</sub> + Area D<sub>3</sub> + Area D<sub>4</sub>

A real life example of this variable type would be a polygon feature
class of land use. Each category would contain a different type of land
use, for example residential, industrial, natural etc. Total land areas
of each land use category within the circular buffer would be produced,
e.g. in m<sup>2</sup> for the British National Grid.

**Polygon Value within Buffer**

<img src="Images\PolyInBuffer_MultCatValue.jpg" width="500px" height="500px" />

This example diagram is based on a polygon feature class with four
categories (A,B,C,D) and each polygon has a numeric value attribute
(“Value”). For a given buffer distance the wizard will calculate the
total area weighted value for each category within the buffer, e.g.

-   Total area weighted value of category A = ((Area of A<sub>1</sub>
    inside buffer / Total Area of A<sub>1</sub>) x Value of
    A<sub>1</sub>) + ((Area of A<sub>2</sub> inside buffer / Total Area
    of A<sub>2</sub>) x Value of A<sub>2</sub>)
-   Total area weighted value of category B = ((Area of B<sub>1</sub>
    inside buffer / Total Area of B<sub>1</sub>) x Value of
    B<sub>1</sub>) + ((Area of B<sub>2</sub> inside buffer / Total Area
    of B<sub>2</sub>) x Value of B<sub>2</sub>)
-   Total area weighted value of category C = ((Area of C<sub>1</sub>
    inside buffer / Total Area of C<sub>1</sub>) x Value of
    C<sub>1</sub>) + ((Area of C<sub>2</sub> inside buffer / Total Area
    of C<sub>2</sub>) x Value of C<sub>2</sub>)
-   Total area weighted value of category D = ((Area of D<sub>1</sub>
    inside buffer / Total Area of D<sub>1</sub>) x Value of
    D<sub>1</sub>) + ((Area of D<sub>2</sub> inside buffer / Total Area
    of D<sub>2</sub>) x Value of D<sub>2</sub>)

A real life example of this variable type would be a polygon feature
class of population density.

Alternatively, the wizard can calculate the total sum of the product of
the polygon area and the polygon value, e.g.

-   Total sum of product of area and value of category A = (Area of
    A<sub>1</sub> inside buffer x Value of A<sub>1</sub>) + (Area of
    A<sub>2</sub> inside buffer x Value of A<sub>2</sub>)
-   Total sum of product of area and value of category B = (Area of
    B<sub>1</sub> inside buffer x Value of B<sub>1</sub>) + (Area of
    B<sub>2</sub> inside buffer x Value of B<sub>2</sub>)
-   Total sum of product of area and value of category C = (Area of
    C<sub>1</sub> inside buffer x Value of C<sub>1</sub>) + (Area of
    C<sub>2</sub> inside buffer x Value of C<sub>2</sub>)
-   Total sum of product of area and value of category D = (Area of
    D<sub>1</sub> inside buffer x Value of D<sub>1</sub>) + (Area of
    D<sub>2</sub> inside buffer x Value of D<sub>2</sub>)

A real life example of this variable type would be a polygon feature
class of area emission sources such as fugitive emissions from land use
categories based on different estimated car parking densities. Another
example is anthropogenic heat emissions from different residential land
uses depending on housing characteristics and estimated energy use.

Polygon Feature Class
</h2>
<p>
From the dropdown menu select the polygon feature class from which you
would like to extract data. The polygon feature class should have a
spatial extent that is larger than: the study area + the largest buffer
distance. The polygon feature class should not contain spatial
duplicates or invalid geometries (if uncertain about invalid geometries,
run the Check Geometry or Repair Geometry tool prior to running the
wizard). The polygon feature class must contain a text field, which
identifies a category for each polygon. If the feature class contains
only one category, a dummy text field should be created with all rows
set to the same text string. If the Area weighted value or Area \* Value
aggregation method will be used, the polygon feature class must also
contain a numeric field.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size:125%;font-weight:normal;">
Category Field
</h2>
<p>
From the dropdown menu select the text field, which identifies the
category of each polygon. If the feature class contains only one
category, select a dummy text field in which all rows are set to the
same text string.

Define Direction of Effect

<p>
For each row in this box select whether the predictor variable is
expected to have a positive or a negative direction of effect. The user
has to make an <em>a priori</em> assumption for each predictor variable:
a positive direction of effect is a predictor variable that will
increase the value of the dependent variable, i.e. it is considered to
be a source of the dependent variable and the beta coefficient is
expected to be positive. A negative direction of effect is a predictor
variable that will decrease the value of the dependent variable, i.e. it
is considered to be a sink of the dependent variable and the beta
coefficient is expected to be negative. These specifications will be
used as model selection criteria in the statistical analysis; therefore,
the user must consider carefully whether each predictor variable has a
positive or a negative direction of effect. <strong>Incorrect
specifications will lead to incorrect LUR models!</strong>

#### Line Length or Value within Buffer

For this type of variable a line feature class should be used, which has
a spatial extent that is larger than: the study area + the largest
buffer distance. The line feature class should not contain
duplicates.The line feature class must contain a text field, which
identifies a category for each line. If the feature class contains only
one category, a dummy text field should be created with all rows set to
the same value.

**Line Length within Buffer**

<img src="Images\LineInBuffer_MultCat.jpg" width="500px" height="500px" />

This example diagram is based on a line feature class with two
categories (A,B). For a given buffer distance the wizard will calculate
the total length (in the map unit of the projected coordinate system) of
each category within the buffer, e.g.

-   Total length of category A = Length of A<sub>1</sub> + Length of
    A<sub>2</sub>
-   Total length of category B = Length of B<sub>1</sub> + Length of
    B<sub>2</sub> + Length B<sub>3</sub> + Length B<sub>4</sub> + Length
    B<sub>5</sub> + Length B<sub>6</sub>

A real life example of this variable type would be a line feature class
of roads. Each category would contain a different type of road, for
example motorway, local street etc. Total line lengths of each land use
category within the circular buffer would be produced, e.g. in m for the
British National Grid.

**Line Value within Buffer**

<img src="Images\LineInBuffer_MultValue.jpg" width="500px" height="500px" />

This example diagram is based on a line feature class with two
categories (A,B) and each line has a numeric value. For a given buffer
distance the wizard will calculate the total length weighted value for
each category within the buffer, e.g.

-   Total length weighted value of category A = ((Length of
    A<sub>1</sub> inside buffer / Total Length of A<sub>1</sub>) x Value
    of A<sub>1</sub>) + ((Length of A<sub>2</sub> inside buffer / Total
    Length of A<sub>2</sub>) x Value of A<sub>2</sub>)
-   Total length weighted value of category B = ((Length of
    B<sub>1</sub> inside buffer / Total Length of B<sub>1</sub>) x Value
    of B<sub>1</sub>) + ((Length of B<sub>2</sub> inside buffer / Total
    Length of B<sub>2</sub>) x Value of B<sub>2</sub>) + ((Length of
    B<sub>3</sub> inside buffer / Total Length of B<sub>3</sub>) x Value
    of B<sub>3</sub>) + ((Length of B<sub>4</sub> inside buffer / Total
    Length of B<sub>4</sub>) x Value of B<sub>4</sub>) + ((Length of
    B<sub>5</sub> inside buffer / Total Length of B<sub>5</sub>) x Value
    of B<sub>5</sub>) + ((Length of B<sub>6</sub> inside buffer / Total
    Length of B<sub>6</sub>) x Value of B<sub>6</sub>)

A real life example of this variable type would be a line feature class
of traffic counts.

Alternatively, the wizard can calculate the total sum of the product of
the line length and the line value, e.g.

-   Total sum of product of length and value of category A = (Length of
    A<sub>1</sub> inside buffer x Value of A<sub>1</sub>) + (Length of
    A<sub>2</sub> inside buffer x Value of A<sub>2</sub>)
-   Total sum of product of length and value of category B = (Length of
    B<sub>1</sub> inside buffer x Value of B<sub>1</sub>) + (Length of
    B<sub>2</sub> inside buffer x Value of B<sub>2</sub>) + (Length of
    B<sub>3</sub> inside buffer x Value of B<sub>3</sub>) + (Length of
    B<sub>4</sub> inside buffer x Value of B<sub>4</sub>) + (Length of
    B<sub>5</sub> inside buffer x Value of B<sub>5</sub>) + (Length of
    B<sub>6</sub> inside buffer x Value of B<sub>6</sub>)

A real life example of this variable type would be a line feature class
of proxy emissions loadings represented by average vehicle-kilometres
per day.

#### Point Count or Value within Buffer

For this type of variable a point feature class should be used, which
has a spatial extent that is larger than: the study area + the largest
buffer distance. The point feature class should not contain duplicates.
The point feature class must contain a text field, which identifies a
category for each point. If the feature class contains only one
category, a dummy text field should be created with all rows set to the
same value.

**Point Count within Buffer**

<img src="Images\PointInBuffer_MultCat.jpg" width="500px" height="500px" />

This example diagram is based on a point feature class with three
categories (A,B,C). For a given buffer distance the wizard will count
the number of points belonging to each category within the buffer, e.g.

-   Total count of category A = {A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>}
-   Total count of category B = {B<sub>1</sub> }
-   Total count of category C = {C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>}

A real life example of this variable type would be a point feature class
of trees. Each category would contain a different tree species, for
example *Quercus robur, Fagus sylvatica, Cornus sanguinea* etc.The count
would therefore be the number of individuals of each species within the
buffer. Another example would be the count of particular stacks
(chimneys) used as a proxy of emission rates.

**Point Value within Buffer**

<img src="Images\PointInBuffer_MultValue.jpg" width="500px" height="500px" />

This example diagram is based on a point feature class with three
categories (A,B,C) and each point has a numeric value. For a given
buffer distance the wizard will calculate the sum of values for each
category within the buffer, e.g.

-   Sum of values of category A = Value of A<sub>1</sub> + Value of
    A<sub>2</sub>
-   Sum of values of category B = Value of B<sub>1</sub>
-   Sum of values of category C = Value of C<sub>1</sub> + Value of
    C<sub>2</sub>

A real life example of this variable type would be a point feature class
of chimney stacks with different emission rates (e.g. grammes of NOx per
hour).

Alternatively, the wizard can calculate the mean or median of the
values, e.g.

-   Mean of values of category A = (Value of A<sub>1</sub> + Value of
    A<sub>2</sub>) / Number of points within buffer belonging to
    category A
-   Mean of values of category B = Value of B<sub>1</sub> / Number of
    points within buffer belonging to category B
-   Mean of values of category C = (Value of C<sub>1</sub> + Value of C)
    / Number of points within buffer belonging to category C<sub>2</sub>

A real life example of this variable type would be tree height.

a positive direction of effect is a predictor variable that will
increase the value of the dependent variable, i.e. it is considered to

expected to be positive. A negative direction of effect is a predictor
variable that will decrease the value of the dependent variable, i.e. it
is considered to be a sink of the dependent variable and the beta

### Distance based Predictors

#### Distance to and/or Value of nearest Polygon

For this type of variable a polygon feature class should be used, which
ideally has a spatial extent that is larger than the study area. The
polygon feature class must not contain spatial duplicates or invalid
geometries (if uncertain about invalid geometries, run the Repair
Geometries tool prior to running the wizard).

![](Images\PolygonDistance.jpg)

This example diagram shows a feature class of non-contiguous polygons
with different values for each feature. For each each point feature
representing a monitoring site the wizard will identify the nearest
polygon and calculate one or more of the following options:

-   Distance = The distance to the nearest polygon edge (in the map unit
    of the projected coordinate system)
-   Inverse distance = 1 / distance to the nearest polygon edge
-   Inverse distance squared = 1 / (distance to the nearest polygon
    edge)<sup>2</sup>
-   Value = The value of the nearest polygon
-   Value \* Distance = The value of the nearest polygon x the distance
    to the nearest polygon edge
-   Value \* Inverse distance = The value of the nearest polygon x (1 /
    distance to the nearest polygon edge)
-   Value \* Inverse distance squared = The value of the nearest polygon
    x (1 / (distance to the nearest polygon edge)<sup>2</sup>)

A real life example of this variable type would be proximity to water
bodies with the potential to reduce air temperatures monitored at
weather stations or the impact of fugitive emission sources from
industrial sites on air quality. Inverse squared distance values are
useful to represent the importance of distance, i.e. to give greater
importance to nearby polygon features compared with those further away.
A Value attribute field might be useful if the size of the feature is
important, e.g. livestock densities on agricultural land parcels in the
case of ambient ammonia concentrations.

<style>
div.red {border:2px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; background-color:#ffcccc; padding:5px;}
</style>

<div class="red">

If the monitoring site is located on top of a polygon (i.e. the distance
is zero) the Inverse distance, Inverse distance squared, Value \*
Inverse Distance, and Value \* Inverse distance squared options will
produce a division by zero error and the result for the feature will be
set to **missing**. The Distance and Value \* Distance options will
produce a result of **zero**. Therefore, the user should carefully
inspect the data prior to using these options.

<p>
For each row in this box select whether the predictor variable is

a positive direction of effect is a predictor variable that will
increase the value of the dependent variable, i.e. it is considered to

the user must consider carefully whether each predictor variable has a
positive or a negative direction of effect. <strong>Incorrect
specifications will lead to incorrect LUR models!</strong>
<p>
For example, the distance to a polygon that will increase the dependent
variable (i.e. a source polygon) is assumed to have a negative direction
of effect (i.e. it is expected to have a negative coefficient), because
as distance increases the value of the predictor variable increases,
while the actual effect of the polygon decreases. Conversely, the
inverse distance and inverse distance squared to a polygon that will
increase the dependent variable is assumed to have a positive direction
of effect, because as distance increases the calculated value
(i.e. 1/distance) of the predictor variable becomes smaller, as does the
effect of the polygon.

#### Distance to and/or Value of nearest Line

For this type of variable a line feature class should be used, which
ideally has a spatial extent that is larger than the study area. The
line feature class must not contain spatial duplicates.

![](Images\LineDistance.jpg)

This example diagram shows a line feature class with different values
for each feature. For each point feature representing a monitoring site
loaction the wizard will identify the nearest line and calculate one or
more of the following options:

-   Distance = The distance to the nearest line (in the map unit of the
    projected coordinate system)
-   Inverse distance = 1 / distance to the nearest line
-   Inverse distance squared = 1 / (distance to the nearest
    line)<sup>2</sup> - Value = The value of the nearest line
-   Value \* Distance = The value of the nearest line x the distance to
    the nearest line
-   Value \* Inverse distance = The value of the nearest line x (1 /
    distance to the nearest line)
-   Value \* Inverse distance squared = The value of the nearest line x
    (1 / (distance to the nearest line)<sup>2</sup>)

A real life example of this variable type would be proximity to the
nearest road feature to represent the potential for higher ambient air
pollutant concentrations due to vehicular emissions or proximity to the
nearest river to represent the potential for lower air temperatures at
nearby weather stations. Inverse squared distance values are useful to
represent the importance of distance, i.e. to give greater importance to
nearby line features compared with those further away. A Value attribute
field might be useful if the size of the feature is important,
e.g. roads with an attribute representing traffic volume.

<div class="red">

If the monitoring site is located on top of a line (i.e. the distance is
zero) the Inverse distance, Inverse distance squared, Value \* Inverse
Distance, and Value \* Inverse distance squared options will produce a
division by zero error and the result for the feature will be set to
**missing**. The Distance and Value \* Distance options will produce a
result of **zero**. Therefore, the user should carefully inspect the
data prior to using these options.

<h2 style="font-size:125%;font-weight:normal;">
Define Direction of Effect
</h2>
<p>
For each row in this box select whether the predictor variable is
expected to have a positive or a negative direction of effect. The user
has to make an <em>a priori</em> assumption for each predictor variable:
a positive direction of effect is a predictor variable that will
increase the value of the dependent variable, i.e. it is considered to
be a source of the dependent variable and the beta coefficient is
expected to be positive. A negative direction of effect is a predictor
variable that will decrease the value of the dependent variable, i.e. it
is considered to be a sink of the dependent variable and the beta
coefficient is expected to be negative. These specifications will be
used as model selection criteria in the statistical analysis; therefore,
the user must consider carefully whether each predictor variable has a
positive or a negative direction of effect. <strong>Incorrect
specifications will lead to incorrect LUR models!</strong>
<p>
For example, the distance to a line that will increase the dependent
variable (i.e. a source line) is assumed to have a negative direction of
effect (i.e. it is expected to have a negative coefficient), because as
distance increases the value of the predictor variable increases, while
the actual effect of the line decreases. Conversely, the inverse
distance and inverse distance squared to a line that will increase the
dependent variable is assumed to have a positive direction of effect,
because as distance increases the calculated value (i.e. 1/distance) of
the predictor variable becomes smaller, as does the effect of the line.

<p>
After all predictor variables in the list have been defined as either
positive or negative, click the <span

#### Distance to and/or Value of nearest Point

For this type of variable a point feature class should be used, which
ideally has a spatial extent that is larger than the study area. The
point feature class must not contain spatial duplicates.

![](Images\PointDistance.jpg)

This example diagram shows a point feature class with different values
for each feature. For each monitoring site the wizard will identify the
nearest point and calculate one or more of the following options:

-   Distance = The distance to the nearest point (in the map unit of the
    projected coordinate system)
-   Inverse distance = 1 / distance to the nearest point
-   Inverse distance squared = 1 / (distance to the nearest
    point)<sup>2</sup> - Value = The value of the nearest point
-   Value \* Distance = The value of the nearest point x the distance to
    the nearest point
-   Value \* Inverse distance = The value of the nearest point x (1 /
    distance to the nearest point)
-   Value \* Inverse distance squared = The value of the nearest point x
    (1 / (distance to the nearest point)<sup>2</sup>)

A real life example of this variable type would be proximity to the
nearest point feature representing a chimney stack. In this case closer
distances are more likely to result in higher pollutant concentrations.
Inverse squared distance values are useful to represent the importance
of distance, i.e. to give greater importance to nearby point features
compared with those further away. A Value attribute field might be
useful if the size of the feature is important, e.g. the emission rate
from the chimney stack.

<div class="red">

If the monitoring site is located on top of a point (i.e. the distance
is zero) the Inverse distance, Inverse distance squared, Value \*
Inverse Distance, and Value \* Inverse distance squared options will
produce a division by zero error and the result for the feature will be
set to **missing**. The Distance and Value \* Distance options will
produce a result of **zero**. Therefore, the user should carefully
inspect the data prior to using these options.

### Raster based Predictors

#### Value of Raster cell

You must have a **Spatial Analyst license** to create this type of
predictor. For this type of variable a raster grid file should be used,
which ideally has a spatial extent that is larger than the study area.
The wizard will extract the value of the raster cell that is spatially
coincident with the point location representing the monitoring site
(dependent variable).

An example of the use of this predictor variable type is elevation.
Elevation is commonly sourced from a Digital Elevation Model stored as a
raster grid.

# Apply LUR

To apply a LUR model built with the wizard to estimate values for a
number of receptor point locations double-click the ApplyLUR script in
the XLUR toolbox. The ApplyLUR tool will appear in the Geoprocessing
pane. Click the Run button in the bottom right corner to run the tool.

![](Images\apply_tool.jpg)

This will open the ApplyLUR wizard. The wizard will guide you through
the process of applying a LUR model by using the following steps:

## Step 1 - Settings

This step is required to specify some general settings to apply a LUR
model.

# Troubleshooting

## Known issues

1.  After closing the XLUR project and exiting ArcGIS Pro you may see a
    warning message similar to this one:

<img src="Images\ShutdownWarning.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

This is a warning only, it is not a critical error. This is a known
issue and it has been reported to ESRI as a potential bug.

1.  Running the XLUR tools repeatedly may cause ArcGIS Pro to crash.
    This may be related to the warning shown in issue 1. It is
    recommended to restart ArcGIS Pro between separate runs of the XLUR
    tools.

## Frequently Asked Questions

-   ***In my data each land use type is stored in an individual feature
    class. How can I use these data?***

Add a text field to each feature class. In each feature class set all
rows of this new text field to the same value. For example, you could
set all rows to show the name of the type of land use that is stored in
this feature class.

-   ***I cannot read the full name of an option in a dropdown menu,
    because the name is very long***

Enlarge the window by dragging its right side or click the maximise
button in the title bar.

-   ***I cannot see the Finish button on the Model page***

Enlarge the window by clicking the maximise button in the title bar.

-   ***Some of my receptor points were not modelled by the ApplyLUR
    tool***

Please inspect your receptor points carefully on a map and look at the
predictor variables in your LUR models. If the LUR models contain
predictors that are derived from the Inverse distance, Inverse distance
squared, Value \* Inverse Distance, or Value \* Inverse distance squared
to the nearest feature method, then any receptor points spatially
coincident with the nearest feature will be dropped to prevent a
division by zero error.

-   ***The Build LUR tool freezes when I use the Value of Raster cell
    page***

Please check that you have a license for Spatial Analyst.

# Tutorial

This section provides a guided tutorial for building and applying a LUR
model using the XLUR wizard. In this tutorial you will build and apply a
predictive air pollution model for the Greater Manchester area using
[openly accessible
datasets](https://github.com/anmolter/XLUR/blob/master/ExampleData/ExampleData_Sources.md)
on monitored Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations, land use
categories, road networks, and emission sources. Please note that the
purpose of this tutorial is to illustrate the use of the XLUR wizard,
not to develop a high performing LUR model; therefore, only a small
number of input datasets are used in this tutorial.

## Before you start

1.  Ensure that you have cloned or downloaded the XLUR repository from
    GitHub, including the ExampleData folder.
2.  Follow the instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section
    to ensure that the additional Python packages required by XLUR have
    been installed and that you have a license for Spatial Analyst.
3.  Create a directory where you would like to store outputs from the
    model, for example C:\\Work\\XLUROutput. Please ensure that you have
    write access to this directory and that there are no spaces in the
    file path.

## Starting the XLUR wizard

1.  Start ArcGIS Pro and open the XLUR project. The XLUR.aprx project
    file can be found in the XLUR folder in the XLUR repository.
2.  In the Catalog window right-click Folders and click Add Folder
    Connection. Create a connection to the ExampleData.gdb file
    geodatabase, which is stored in the ExampleData folder in the XLUR
    repository.  
3.  Double-click toolboxes, double-click XLUR.tbx, then double-click the
    BuildLUR script. In the Geoprocessing window on the right click Run.
    This will open the Build LUR wizard.

If at any time you require more information on a specific section, click
on the question mark button next to the section heading. This will open
a help window with further information on how to complete each section.

## Settings

On this page you will specify the general settings required by XLUR
wizard.

1.  **Set Project Name**
    -   Next to Project Name type a suitable name for your LUR model
        (e.g. MyFirstLUR) and click Enter.
2.  **Set Directories**
    -   Click the Browse button next to Input File Geodatabase and
        navigate to ExampleData.gdb.
    -   Click the Browse button next to Output Folder and navigate to
        the directory where you would like to store outputs from the
        model.
3.  **Set Coordinate System**
    -   You must specify a projected coordinate system for the data. The
        help menu provides a link to the well-known ID (WKID) numbers
        for the coordinate systems provided in ArcGIS Pro. In this
        tutorial you will use the British National Grid projected
        coordinate system. Its WKID is 27700.  
4.  **Set Study Area**
    -   From the dropdown menu select GMArea.

The completed Settings page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P1.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next &gt; to continue.

## Outcomes

On this page you will specify the data that will be used as the outcome
that the LUR model needs to predict. In this tutorial the outcome is
annual average Nitrogen Dioxide concentrations measured by diffusion
tubes in the Greater Manchester area.

1.  **Set Dependent Variable**
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Monitoring Sites select
        GMDiffusionTubes.
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Select Site ID select SiteID.
    -   In the box next to Dependent Variables tick NO2, then click
        Select. In the box below Outcomes Added depNO2 should appear.

The completed Outcomes page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P2.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next &gt; to continue.

## Predictors

On the next pages you will specify potential predictors for the LUR
model. Potential predictor variables fall into seven types and further
information on these types is provided in the help menu. You can add as
many or as few predictors as you wish. You can see in the box below
Predictors Added that the coordinates of each monitoring site have been
automatically added as potential predictor variables.

Click the Add button next to A. Polygon Area or Value within Buffer.

### Polygon Area or Value within Buffer

Through this page you will create potential predictor variables that are
based on drawing circular buffers around each monitoring site and
extracting the area or attribute value from a polygon feature class that
intersects these buffers. For the purpose of this tutorial you will
create predictors that show the area of different land use categories
within each buffer.

1.  **Set Variable Name**
    -   In the box next to Variable Name type a name for the variable to
        be created, e.g. landuseArea, then click Enter.
2.  **Set Buffer Sizes**
    -   Under Buffers select Create new buffer.
    -   In the box next to Create Buffer Distance type in 100 (this will
        create a buffer with a radius of 100m), then click Add. The
        buffer distance that you have added will appear in the box
        below.
    -   Repeat this step to add buffer distances of 300, 500, 1000,
        and 5000. If you make a mistake, select the incorrect buffer
        distance and click remove.
    -   Once all buffer distances have been entered click Done.
3.  **Set Input Data**
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Polygon Feature Class select
        CorineLanduse.
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Category Field select LanduseCat.
    -   Under Aggregation Method select Total area.
4.  **Set Direction of Effect**
    -   The box next to Define Direction of Effect is automatically
        populated with the names of the predictor variables that will be
        created. In this case the variable name includes the name that
        was entered at the top of the page (landuseArea), the names of
        the land use categories
        (HDres,Industry,LDres,Natural,UrbGreen,Port), the buffer
        distances (100,300,500,1000,5000), and the aggregation method
        (sum indicates that the total area within the buffer will be
        used). For each predictor variable you must now select whether
        the *a priori* assumed direction of effect of the predictor is
        positive or negative. This is a critical step, for further
        information on this click the help button. In an air pollution
        study it is usually assumed that urban and industrial land uses
        increase pollution levels, i.e. their direction of effect will
        be positive, while natural land uses decrease pollution levels,
        i.e. their direction of effect will be negative. Scroll through
        the list of predictor variables and set all HDres, Industry,
        LDres, and Port variables to Positive. Set all Natural and
        UrbGreen variables to Negative, then click done.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P3A.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next &gt; to continue. The Predictors page will open again (this
may take a while). You can see that in the box below Predictors Added
the new predictors have been added together with their assumed direction
of effect.

You will now create predictors that show oxides of nitrogen (NOx)
emitted from the area within buffers surrounding the monitoring sites.
Data on NOx emission rates comes in different formats and for this
predictor variable you will use emission rates aggregated at an area
level (in this case regular square polygons). Since the buffers do not
match the emission polygons exactly, the emission rate values need to be
area weighted.

Click the Add button next to A. Polygon Area or Value within Buffer.

1.  **Set Variable Name**
    -   In the box next to Variable Name type a name for the variable to
        be created, e.g. EmissionAreaWt, then click Enter.
2.  **Set Buffer Sizes**
    -   Under Buffers select Use previous buffer.
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Select Buffer Distance select
        \[100, 300, 500, 1000, 5000\]. Make sure to click on this set of
        distances, to select it (it will briefly appear with a blue
        background, if it has been selected).
    -   Click Done.
3.  **Set Input Data**
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Polygon Feature Class select
        TotalNoxEmissionAsNO2\_Tiles.
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Category Field select DummyCat.
        Since categories are not relevant for this dataset a dummy
        variable has been added, which assigns all polygons to the same
        category.
    -   Under Aggregation Method select Area weighted value.
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Value Field select NOxEmission.
4.  **Set Direction of Effect**
    -   The box next to Define Direction of Effect shows the names of
        the predictor variables that will be created. For these
        variables the name includes the name that was entered at the top
        of the page (EmissionAreaWt), the name in the dummy category
        (All), the buffer distances (100,300,500,1000,5000), and the
        aggregation method (wtv indicates that an area weighted value
        will be used). This type of predictor variable represents
        emission rates of pollution, therefore its direction of effect
        is obviously assumed to be positive. Scroll through the list of
        predictor variables and set all variables to Positive, then
        click done.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P3A_2.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next &gt; to continue. You may see a Warning box. Click OK and the
warning will disappear and the Predictors page will open (this may take
a while).

Click the Add button next to B. Line Length or Value within Buffer.

### Line Length or Value within Buffer

Through this page you will create potential predictor variables that are
based on drawing circular buffers around each monitoring site and
extracting the length or attribute value from a line feature class that
intersects these buffers. For this tutorial you will create predictors
that show the lengths of major and minor roads within each buffer.

1.  **Set Variable Name**
    -   In the box next to Variable Name type a name for the variable to
        be created, e.g. rdLength, then click Enter.
2.  **Set Buffer Sizes**
    -   Under Buffers select Create new buffer.
    -   For the buffer distances enter 25, 50, 100, 300, 500, and
        1000.  
3.  **Set Input Data**
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Line Feature Class select
        OSM\_AllRoads.
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Category Field select RoadCat.
    -   Under Aggregation Method select Total length.
4.  **Set Direction of Effect**
    -   Traffic is a major source of air pollution in urban areas.
        Therefore, it is expected that a higher road density will
        increase pollution levels. Scroll through the list of predictor
        variables and set all variables to Positive, then click Done

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P3B.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next &gt; to continue. The Predictors page will open again (this
may take a while).

Click the Add button next to C. Point Count or Value within Buffer.

### Point Count or Value within Buffer

Through this page you will create potential predictor variables that are
based on drawing circular buffers around each monitoring site and
extracting the number of points or a statistic of their attribute values
from a point feature class that intersects these buffers. In this case
you will create predictors that show the sum of NOx emissions from point
sources within each buffer by industry sector.

1.  **Set Variable Name**
    -   In the box next to Variable Name type a name for the variable to
        be created, e.g. EmissionPoint, then click Enter.
2.  **Set Buffer Sizes**
    -   Under Buffers select Use previous buffer.
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Select Buffer Distance select
        \[100, 300, 500, 1000, 5000\]. Make sure to click on this set of
        distances, to select it (it will briefly appear with a blue
        background, if it has been selected).
    -   Click Done.
3.  **Set Input Data**
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Point Feature Class select
        NOxEmissionPointSources.
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Category Field select SectorCat.
    -   Under Aggregation Method select Sum of values.
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Value Field select Emission.
4.  **Set Direction of Effect**
    -   Since emission sources will increase pollution levels, the
        direction of effect of all variables should be set to Positive.
        Click Done.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P3C.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next &gt; to continue. The Predictors page will open again (this
may take a while).

Click the Add button next to D. Distance to and/or Value of nearest
Polygon.

### Distance to and/or value of nearest Polygon

Through this page you will create potential predictor variables that
show the distance from each monitoring site to the nearest polygon, or
the value of the nearest polygon or a combination of the distance and
the value. As shown above NOx emission sources can be processed in
different formats: as point sources or aggregated to an area level (as
square polygons). For the purpose of this tutorial you will extract an
area level emission rate for each monitoring site, which will be the
emission rate of the polygon that the monitoring site is located on.

1.  **Set Variable Name**
    -   In the box next to Variable Name type a name for the variable to
        be created, e.g. EmissionAreaVal, then click Enter.
2.  **Set Method**
    -   In the box next to Data to be extracted tick Value, then click
        Select.
3.  **Set Input Data**
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Polygon Feature Class select
        TotalNoxEmissionAsNO2\_Tiles.
    -   In the box next to Value Field(s) tick NOxEmission, then click
        Select.
4.  **Set Direction of Effect**
    -   Again, as NOx emissions increase, air pollution levels will
        increase; therefore, the direction of effect should be set to
        Positive. Click Done.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P3D.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next &gt; to continue. The Predictors page will open again.

Click the Add button next to E. Distance to and/or Value of nearest
Line.

### Distance to and/or value of nearest Line

Through this page you will create potential predictor variables that
show the distance from each monitoring site to the nearest line, or the
value of the nearest line or a combination of the distance and the
value. For this tutorial you will extract the distance, inverse distance
and inverse distance squared from each monitoring site to the nearest
major road.

1.  **Set Variable Name**
    -   In the box next to Variable Name type a name for the variable to
        be created, e.g. majorRdDist, then click Enter.
2.  **Set Method**
    -   In the box next to Data to be extracted tick Distance, Inverse
        distance and Inverse distance squared, then click Select.
3.  **Set Input Data**
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Line Feature Class select
        OSM\_MajorRoads.
4.  **Set Direction of Effect**
    -   The further away a monitoring site is from a road the less it
        will be influenced by emissions from traffic on the road. This
        means as distance increases, pollution levels will decrease;
        therefore, you should set the direction of effect of the
        Distance variable to Negative. The inverse distance is 1 divided
        by the distance, while the inverse distance squared is 1 divided
        by the squared distance. This means as the distance becomes
        larger the inverse distance and inverse distance squared become
        smaller and so do the pollution levels. Therefore, you should
        set the direction for the Inverse distance and Inverse distance
        squared variables to Positive, then click Done. It is usually
        not necessary to use both the Distance and the Inverse distance,
        as they are functions of each other. However, for the purpose of
        this tutorial both are included to illustrate the fact that they
        have opposite directions of effects.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P3E.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next &gt; to continue. The Predictors page will open again.

Click the Add button next to F. Distance to and/or Value of nearest
Point.

### Distance to and/or value of nearest Point

Through this page you will create potential predictor variables that
show the distance from each monitoring site to the nearest point, or the
value of the nearest point or a combination of the distance and the
value. For this tutorial you will extract the emission rate\*inverse
distance and the emission rate\*inverse distance squared from each
monitoring site to the nearest point source of NOx.

1.  **Set Variable Name**
    -   In the box next to Variable Name type a name for the variable to
        be created, e.g. EmPoint, then click Enter.
2.  **Set Method**
    -   In the box next to Data to be extracted tick Value \* Inverse
        distance and Value \* Inverse distance squared, then click
        Select.
3.  **Set Input Data**
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Point Feature Class select
        NOxEmissionPointSources.
    -   In the box next to Value Field(s) tick Emission, then click
        Select.
4.  **Set Direction of Effect**
    -   As illustrated above when using the inverse distance and inverse
        distance squared the value of the predictor variable changes in
        the same direction as does the pollution levels; therefore, the
        direction of effect for both variables should be set to
        Positive. Click Done.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P3F.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next &gt; to continue. The Predictors page will open again.

If you have a Spatial Analyst license, click the Add button next to G.
Value of Raster cell. If you do not have a Spatial Analyst license, skip
this step and click Next &gt;.

### Value of Raster cell

Through this page you will create potential predictor variables that
show the value of the raster cell that each monitoring site location
spatially coincident with. For this you will use NOx emission rates
aggregated at an area level in raster format. This should yield the same
result as the analysis of the value of the nearest polygon that you used
earlier.

1.  **Set Variable Name**
    -   In the box next to Variable Name type a name for the variable to
        be created, e.g. EmAreaRaster, then click Enter.
2.  **Set Input Data**
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Raster file select
        TotalNOxEmissionsAsNO2\_Raster.
    -   In the box next to Value Field(s) tick Emission, then click
        Select.
3.  **Set Direction of Effect**
    -   Set the direction of effect to Positive, then click Done.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P3G.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next &gt; to continue. The Predictors page will open again. You
can scroll through the list under Predictors Added to check that you
have added all potential predictors that you would like to analyse.

Click Next &gt;.

## Model

This is the final page of the Build LUR wizard. On this page you need to
choose the type of model that you would like to build, before you
finally build the model.

1.  **Export data (optional)**
    -   Click the Export button. This will save the dependent variable
        and potential predictor variables in a text file. This file is
        formatted so that it can be read by most statistical software
        packages, which allows users with statistical expertise to run
        their own analyses on the data.
2.  **Build LUR model**
    -   Under Type of model you can choose between building a classic
        model or a hybrid model. For the purpose of this tutorial select
        Classic LUR. For further information on the difference between
        classic and hybrid models click the help button or refer to the
        General Information section.
    -   Click Build model. Depending on the amount of data entered
        building the model may take several minutes.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P4.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Finish.

Go to the directory of your output folder. Inside this folder you should
see a new folder with the project name that you chose on the Settings
page followed by a date and time stamp. Inside this new folder are the
databases and files created by Build LUR:

<img src="Images\Example_outputfolder.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

[Click here](p1_SetDirectories.html) for an overview of the files
created in the Output folder.

Open the lur\_var\_data\_\[Date\_Time\].csv file. This is the text file
that you exported on the Model page, which contains the dependent
variable and all potential predictor variables. Scroll to the right and
find the pD\_EmissionAreaVal\_NOxEmission\_val variable and the
pG\_EmAreaRaster\_raster\_val variable. The values of these two
variables are identical, which confirms that the value of nearest
polygon and value of raster cell methods produced the same result when
run on the same data.

Open the LOG\_\[Date\_Time\].txt file. This text file records all
entries made into the Build LUR wizard, any warning or error messages,
and the model development process. Scroll through this file until you
find Predictor variables created. This lists all of the variables
created through the Predictors pages of the wizard. You may notice that
some variables are missing, e.g. pA\_landuseArea\_Port\_100\_sum is not
there even though a buffer distance of 100 was specified for all land
use categories. The missing variable is due to the fact that no Port
land use area was found within any of the 100m buffers around the
monitoring sites. Similarly, pC\_EmissionPoint\_Chemical\_1000\_sum,
pC\_EmissionPoint\_Chemical\_500\_sum,
pC\_EmissionPoint\_Chemical\_300\_sum, and
pC\_EmissionPoint\_Chemical\_100\_sum are missing, because no point
emission source from the chemical sector was present in the 1000m, 500m,
300m, or 100m buffers.

Scrolling down further through the file shows that a file of descriptive
statistics was created in the output folder. This file shows the mean,
median and variability of all dependent and predictor variables. If more
than one dependent variable is selected this file will also show the
correlation and pairwise regression plots of the dependent variables.
This information can be useful to analyse the relationship between
different pollutants. In this tutorial only one dependent variable was
used, therefore these plots are empty. In addition, a correlation matrix
of all variables was created and stored in the output folder. This can
be helpful to identify variables that are highly correlated and
therefore may be collinear in the regression model.

The next section shows details of the machine learning process used to
develop the LUR model. XLUR uses supervised stepwise forward linear
regression based on the methodology used in the [ESCAPE
study](http://www.escapeproject.eu/manuals/ESCAPE_Exposure-manualv9.pdf);
see the General Information section for a brief overview of the variable
selection process. XLUR records the starting model, all intermediate
models (including reasons for their acceptance or rejection), and the
final model. For the final model XLUR will also record the following
model diagnostics in the log file:

-   Variance inflation factors - indicating the multicollinearity of the
    variables within the model
-   Case summaries and DF Betas - these can be used to check for bias in
    the model due to influential cases
-   Spatial autocorrelation of the residuals - based on Moran’s I, a
    large p-value indicates no spatial autocorrelation

Further model diagnostics are provided in
Diagnostic\_plots\_dep\[Outcome variable\]\_\[Date\_Time\].pdf. This
file shows a Q Q plot, which can be used to check the assumption of
normality in the final model. It also shows a plot of the residuals vs
the predicted values, which can be used to check for non-linear
relationships, and a Scale-Location plot, which can be used to check for
heteroscedasticity in the model.

XLUR will also carry out a leave one out cross validation of the final
model, the results of which are shown in the LOOCV\_\[dependent variable
name\]\_\[Date\_Time\].pdf file. In a leave one out cross validation
monitoring sites are removed one by one to test the performance of the
final model. When a monitoring site is removed from the dataset the
predictor variables of the final model are used to fit a new model,
i.e. to calculate new coefficients, and this model is used to predict a
value for the monitoring site that has been removed. This process is
repeated for all monitoring sites and the measured and predicted values
are plotted in a scatter plot. Using this scatterplot Pearson’s r, the
adjusted R<sup>2</sup> and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are
calculated.

For the purpose of this tutorial we will accept the final model and move
on to the next step. However, it is recommended that users carefully
check the model diagnostics when building their own models. If the model
diagnostics indicate a problem, it may be necessary to manually develop
a model using the lur\_var\_data\_\[Date\_Time\].csv file and standard
statistical software.

The next step is to apply the LUR model created with the Build LUR
wizard to unmeasured points within the study area.

1.  Close and then restart ArcGIS Pro. *(There is currently a known
    issue with ArcGIS Pro crashing, if XLUR is run multiple times, see
    the Troubleshooting section)*
2.  In the Catalog window double-click the ApplyLUR script.
3.  In the Geoprocessing window on the right click Run. This will open
    the Apply LUR wizard.

## Settings

Similar to the Build LUR wizard you need to specify some general
settings on this page.

1.  **Set Output Name**
    -   Next to Output Name type a suitable name for application output
        (e.g. LURApply) and click Enter.
2.  **Set Data Sources**
    -   Click the Browse button next to LUR File Geodatabase. Navigate
        to the output directory that you used in the Build LUR wizard.
        In this directory select the MyFirstLUR\_\[Date\_Time\].gdb file
        geodatabase.
    -   Click the Browse button next to LUR SQLite Database. Navigate to
        the output directory that you used in the Build LUR wizard. In
        this directory select the LurSqlDB.sqlite database.
3.  **Set Model**
    -   In the box next to Select LUR Model(s) tick MODEL\_depNO2, then
        click Select.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_AppP1.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next&gt; to continue.

## Receptors

To apply the LUR model to unmeasured locations within your study area
you need to provide a number of receptor points. This page provides you
with three options to do this: you can provide an existing point feature
class, you can create regularly spaced points within your study area, or
you can create a number of random points within your study area. For the
purpose of this tutorial select B.Regular Points.

### Receptors from Regular Points

On this page you need to specify the horizontal and vertical distance
between points. The unit of the distance is the map unit of the
projected coordinate system specified in the Build LUR wizard, which in
this case is metres.

1.  **Set Distances**
    -   In the box next to Horizontal Distance type 1000, then click
        Enter.
    -   In the box next to Vertical Distance type 1000, then click
        Enter.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_AppP2B.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next&gt; to continue.

## Apply Model

This is the final page of the Apply LUR wizard.

1.  **Apply LUR Model**
    -   Click the Apply model button. Depending on the number of
        receptor points entered and the complexity of the model this may
        take a while.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_AppP3.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Finish to close the Apply LUR wizard.

Go to the directory of your output folder. Inside your
MyFirstLUR\_\[Date\_Time\] folder you should see a new folder called
LURApply\_\[DateTime\]. Go inside this new folder. You should see two
databases and two text files:

<img src="Images\Example_applyfolder.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Open the Apply\_Log.txt file. Similar to the Build LUR wizard this text
file records all entries made into the Apply LUR wizard. In addition, it
indicates the time it took to extract values for each predictor variable
and to calculate predicted values.

The out\_pred.csv file contains the coordinates of the receptor points,
the values of the predictor variables at each receptor point and the
predicted values of NO<sub>2</sub> at each receptor point. This data has
also been added as a feature class to the LURApply file geodatabase.
This enables the user to use the predicted values in further analyses or
to report them as results on a map.

To quickly view the predicted values calculated by the Apply LUR wizard:

1.  In ArcGIS Pro insert a new map.
2.  Click on Add Data and navigate to the LURApply\_\[Date\_Time\]
    folder.
3.  Open the LURApply.gdb file geodatabase, then open the LURdata
    feature dataset and select pred\_lyr. The pred\_lyr feature class
    contains predicted values for all dependent variables. In this case
    there was only one dependent variable, which was monitored
    NO<sub>2</sub>.
4.  In the Appearance menu click on Symbology and select the Graduated
    Colors option.
5.  In the Symbology pane on the right select predNO2 in the dropdown
    list next to Field.
6.  Select Quantile in the dropdown list next to Method.
7.  Choose a suitable number for Classes (e.g. 5) and a suitable Color
    scheme (e.g. Prediction).

You should see something similar to this:

<img src="Images\Example_applymap.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

The [TutorialOutput
folder](https://github.com/anmolter/XLUR/tree/master/TutorialOutput)
contains examples of the variable data, descriptive analyses,
correlation matrix, diagnostic plots, log file, residuals, and leave one
out crossvalidation plot created during the Build LUR step. The
[LURApply
subfolder](https://github.com/anmolter/XLUR/tree/master/TutorialOutput/LURApply)
contains examples of the log file and output value file created during
the Apply LUR step.
