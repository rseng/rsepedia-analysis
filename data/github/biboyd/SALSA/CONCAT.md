# Introduction

The hot, low density gas surrounding galaxies, called the circumgalactic medium
(CGM), is vital to understanding the structure and evolution of galaxies
[@Tumlinson:2017; @Voit:2017]. The diffuse nature of the CGM makes it difficult
to observe by direction detection in emission, so much of our understanding
comes from studying absorption line features in the spectra of light from
distant quasars that pass through intervening galaxies
[@Howk:2017; @Lehner:2018]. A single quasar sightline only contains information
about a relatively small portion of gas in the halo of an individual galaxy.
Because of this,  observational astronomers conduct surveys to collect many
sightlines and create large absorber catalogs that contain information about
the variety of absorption lines found in each individual sightline. These
catalogs create a statistical picture of the CGM and have proved invaluable in
our understanding of the dynamics in the CGM.

As a complement to observational surveys, hydrodynamic simulations have also
become increasingly important for studying the CGM and efforts have been made to
apply absorption line analysis to simulated data
[@Smith:2011; @Egan:2014; @Peeples:2019]. Trident[^1] is a Python package, built off of yt[^2] [@Turk:2011], that
can extract an artificial sightline, referred to as a “LightRay” in the code,
from simulation data and then generate synthetic spectra from that sightline
[@Hummels:2017]. Analyses using Trident provide the opportunity to explore simulations from an
observer’s perspective, which facilitates making direct comparisons to
observational studies. In this way, Trident provides a new avenue of study for
simulators. However, a straightforward, streamlined process for replicating
observational absorber catalogs is not yet readily available.

# Statement of Need

In order to fill this void, we introduce the Python package, SALSA (Synthetic
Absorption Line Surveyor Application). SALSA is a package that generates
synthetic absorber catalogs by studying the LightRays and/or spectra generated
using Trident. SALSA provides an automated pipeline to process large numbers of
LightRays and extract absorber information into a catalog for further analysis.
One large benefit to studying these synthetic catalogs is the ability to directly
compare to observational catalogs. This can give new insights into the
data as well as help facilitate collaboration between simulators and observers.

# Summary

Two separate methods are made available to extract absorbers. The “Spectacle
method” uses the Python package Spectacle[^3] to fit Voigt profiles to the
synthetic spectra generated by Trident (see \autoref{fig:1}) [@spectacle]. This
method provides traditional absorption line information (e.g., Doppler
broadening, equivalent width) and thus creates synthetic absorber
catalogs very similar to those made from observational studies.

The second method, called the “SPICE (Simple Procedure for Iterative Cloud
Extraction) method,” is a novel method that uses cell level data from the
simulation to find the contiguous groups of cells which will meaningfully
contribute absorption line features to the synthetic spectra. It does this
through an iterative process that isolates the regions along the LightRay with
the highest number density values and returns those regions with
observationally detectable column densities as individual absorbers (see
\autoref{fig:1} or for more details, the documentation[^4]). This method
provides direct access to the information contained in the simulation (e.g.,
temperature, velocity, metallicity) and, in turn, more information than
can be provided by spectral absorption line analysis alone.

![These plots were generated using FOGGIE simulation data [@Peeples:2019]. The
top plot shows the number density profile of O VI along the length of the
LightRay. The shaded regions were found by the SPICE method and represent the
absorbers that would be extracted.  The bottom plot shows the synthetic spectra
for that same LightRay. The dashed lines represent the two absorption lines that
Spectacle fit to the spectra. \label{fig:1}](spice_spectacle_fig.png)

Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the research
goals. Spectacle extracts absorbers in a way that is much more analogous to that
of observational studies and thus can more easily be used to make “apples-to-apples”
comparisons between simulations and observations. The SPICE method, on
the other hand, retains much of the additional information provided by
simulation data, allowing for more in-depth analysis of the properties of
absorbers and how those relate to the simulated galaxy as a whole.

Once a synthetic absorber catalog is generated, analysis of the data can proceed
from an observer’s perspective. Coupling this analysis with the unprocessed
simulation data can bring powerful insights about how the CGM functions and how
observations might provide a limited view into this complex medium. Current
research efforts with the FOGGIE collaboration[^5] are leveraging SALSA to
study O VI absorbers in the CGM. Further work will assuredly provide more
discoveries and better connect the cutting-edge research done by computational
and observational astronomers studying the CGM.

SALSA: Synthetic Absorption Line Surveyor Application is a Python tool that
constructs synthetic absorber catalogs from hydrodynamic galaxy simulations.
Salsa heavily utilizes [yt](https://yt-project.org/) to access simulation data
and [Trident](http://trident-project.org/) to create light rays/sight lines and
generate synthetic spectra.

Observational studies generate large absorber catalogs by studying the absorption
line spectra of distant quasars, as their light passes through intervening galaxies.
Salsa can generate similar catalogs from cosmological and galactic simulations,
allowing research to study these simulations from an observers perspective. This
can give new insights into the data as well as help facilitate comparisons and
collaboration between simulations and observations.

Salsa allows us to dip into galactic simulations and start to chip away at the
many unknowns of the universe

A [JOSS paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02581) was published for 
SALSA and we recommend reading it for an overview of the package and its possible uses. 
If you do use SALSA in a project we ask that you cite this paper.

For detailed information on how to install and run salsa, Read the Docs
[here](https://salsa.readthedocs.io)

## Install
If you have all the dependencies installed, you can use pip and
run these commands to install the most stable version:
```
  $ pip install astro-salsa
  $ python
  >>> import salsa
```
If you want to install the latest development version and have all the dependencies 
installed, you can clone the repository and run these commands:
```
  $ git clone https://github.com/biboyd/SALSA.git
  $ cd SALSA
  $ pip install -e .
  $ python
  >>> import salsa
```
Now you should be all set to code!

### Installing dependencies
To help with installing dependencies, `enivronment.yml` is included in the
repository. First,
[install conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
Then you should be able to create a conda environment via:
```
  $ conda env create --file environment.yml
  $ conda activate salsa-env
```
Note that you need gcc compiler installed (which it often already is on most machines).
For a more detailed description see the
[installation guide](https://salsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
which also includes tips if you want to install dependencies on your own.

## Getting Started
For an annotated example [go here](https://salsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/annotated_example.html). Or launch an interactive jupyter hosted on Binder
[here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/biboyd/SALSA/master?filepath=notebooks%2FExample_notebook.ipynb) (note that the notebook
may take some time to load as it generally has to build the repository).

If you want to explore on your own, the easiest way to get started is use
`salsa.generate_catalog()`. This takes:
  * The simulation dataset
  * Number of light rays/sightlines to make
  * Directory to save those light rays
  * A list of ions
  * Some other optional parameters.  
This creates a number light rays and then extracts absorbers for each ion. A
`pandas.DataFrame` is returned with information about all the absorbers which
can then be further analyzed.
