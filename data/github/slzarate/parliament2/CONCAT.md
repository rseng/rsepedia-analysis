# Parliament2

**NOTE: This fork of the DNAnexus version of Parliament2 (slzarate/parliament2) is currently under construction. Please continue to use the DNAnexus version (installation details below) until further notice.**

Parliament2 identifies structural variants in a given sample relative to a reference genome. These structural variants cover large deletion events that are called as Deletions of a region, Insertions of a sequence into a region, Duplications of a region, Inversions of a region, or Translocations between two regions in the genome.

Parliament2 runs a combination of tools to generate structural variant calls on whole-genome sequencing data. It can run the following callers: Breakdancer, Breakseq2, CNVnator, Delly2, Manta, and Lumpy. Because of synergies in how the programs use computational resources, these are all run in parallel. Parliament2 will produce the outputs of each of the tools for subsequent investigation.

If the option to genotype candidates is selected, this tool will run SVTyper to genotype the events and will merge these tools with the program SURVIVOR. SV events that receive genotype calls have significantly higher specificity.

If the option to visualize candidates is selected, a `.tar.gz` file containing PDF images for each SV call will be produced in order to summarize the supporting information behind the SV.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You must have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed in order to run Parliament2. No other dependencies are required. Please see the Docker documentation for installation information.

### Licensing
This software uses an Apache 2.0 license, which is contained within this Github repo.

### Installing

Parliament2 is meant to be run as a Docker image and is [available on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dnanexus/parliament2/). The simplest way to install Parliament2 on your machine is to run the command `docker pull dnanexus/parliament2:<TAG>`, where the `<TAG>` is the version of Parliament2 you wish to use. You can see the full list of Parliament2 versions available on DockerHub at the [Parliament2 DockerHub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/dnanexus/parliament2/tags/).

You can verify the successful installation using the command `docker images`, which will list every Docker image stored locally on your machine, or by running `docker run dnanexus/parliament2:<TAG> -h`, which will print the help string (printed in full at the bottom of this README).

#### Building from source

If you wish to build Parliament2 from source, you can find the most up-to-date production version of Parliament2 on our [release page](https://github.com/dnanexus/parliament2/releases) or pull from this repository (warning: this version may be unstable; the official releases will be more stable).

Once you have made your desired modifications (if applicable), run:

```
cd parliament2
tar -czvf resources.tar.gz resources/
docker build . -t parliament2
```

There should now be a Docker image named `parliament2` on your computer.

Again, you can verify the successful installation using the command `docker images`, which will list every Docker image stored locally on your machine, or by running `docker run parliament2 -h`, which will print the help string (printed in full at the bottom of this README).

## Running

### Required inputs

To run this Docker image, you must have:

* A local file with Illumina reads on which you want to call structural variants (`*.bam`)
* A reference genome file to which the BAM file was mapped (`*.fa.gz` or `*.fasta.gz`)

You may also have:

* The index for the BAM file (`*.bai`)
* The index for the reference genome file (`*.fai`)

This app is intended for whole-genome sequencing. Providing exome or panel sequencing will not produce good results. It is intended to be run on a single germline sample.

### Command-line call

To run Parliament2, use the following command-line call:

```
docker run -v <LOCAL_DIR_WITH_INPUTS>:/home/dnanexus/in -v <LOCAL_DIR_FOR_OUTPUTS>:/home/dnanexus/out dnanexus/parliament2:<TAG> --bam <BAM_NAME> --bai <INDEX_NAME> --fai <REFERENCE_INDEX> -r <REFERENCE_NAME> <OPTIONAL_ARGUMENTS>
```

You must mount two local volumes -- one that contains the inputs (`*.bam` and `*.fa.gz`) and one in which you wish to place the files generated by Parliament2. The `--bai` and `--fai` flags, along with the BAM and FASTA index files, are optional, but including either or both will speed up runtime considerably. At least one optional argument must be specified; see [below](#help) for more information on the optional arguments.

For example, if your current working directory is named `/home/dnanexus/` and looks like this:

```
.
├── input.bam
├── input.bai
├── ref_genome.fa.gz
└── outputs
```

where `outputs` is the directory you wish Parliament2 to place its results files, the command you would use to run Parliament2 could be:

```
docker run -v /home/dnanexus/:/home/dnanexus/in -v /home/dnanexus/outputs/:/home/dnanexus/out dnanexus/parliament2<TAG> --bam input.bam --bai input.bai -r ref_genome.fa.gz --breakdancer --cnvnator --manta --genotype
```

### Files generated

This app will output a number of files, representing the outputs of each of the structural variant callers. If the option to run a given step is unselected, then those outputs will not be provided.

## Running Parliament2 on DNAnexus

Parliament2 is available as an app on DNAnexus at https://platform.dnanexus.com/app/parliament2 (note: a DNAnexus account is required to access this link; you can create one at https://platform.dnanexus.com/login). The documentation for the app is included both on the DNAnexus platform and in the `dx_app_code` directory of this repository. A DNAnexus account is required to access the platform.

To run Parliament2 on DNAnexus, your input BAM file must be already on the DNAnexus platform. To run Parliament2 using the graphic interface, simply click the "Run" button from the app page and select your inputs. To run Parliament2 using the command-line interface, run the command `dx run parliament2 -h` and follow the guide generated. For more information on running executables on DNAnexus, see the [guide to running apps and applets](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Command-Line-Client/Running-Apps-and-Applets).

General information on using DNAnexus can be found in the [official documentation](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Home).

### Building Parliament2 on DNAnexus

To build Parliament2 on your own on DNAnexus, you will have to have built the Docker image locally (see [Installing](#installing)). Then:

* Run `dx-docker create-asset parliament2`. This will take approximately 45 minutes and will generate a string that you can copy-paste into the `dxapp.json` file found in the `dx_app_code/parliament2` directory under the "Regional Options" section for your region.

* Run `dx build parliament2` to build the applet from within the `dx_app_code` directory.

## More Information

### FAQ

#### Samtools error

> The tool runs but I am getting a samtools error:
```
samtools view: writing to standard output failed: Broken pipe
samtools view: error closing standard output: -1
```
> What's going on?

This is a known error message caused by splitting the BAM file. It doesn't affect the results in any way.

#### Pysam warning

> The tool runs but I am getting the following warning:
```
breakseq2 -2.2- has requirement pysam==0.7.7, but you'll have pysam 0.15.1 which is incompatible
```
> What's going on?

This is a known error message caused by how we currently manage the conflicting pysam versions required for BreakSeq and SVTyper. This issue should be resolved in v0.1.10.

#### Out of memory error

> The tool fails or runs for a long time and I see an error message in the log:
```
Out of memory: Kill process XXXX (svviz) score 112 or sacrifice child
```
> What's going on?

The svviz tool can at times consume a large amount of memory, causing the application to be killed. If you see this message in the log, you should kill the job if it is still running and retry on a machine with more memory or without enabling svviz. This issue should be resolved in v0.1.11.

### Additional notes

Because the field of structural variation is relatively new and complex, we viewed placing a dependency on all individual tools completing successfully as a requirement for a successful run to be too strict. In other words, if one of these tools fails while the others succeed, the app will output the results of the tools that completed and will not itself fail.

Breakseq2 may only be able to work when using the 1000 Genomes reference genome (hs37d5). For other reference genomes, you may not get Breakseq2 results.

# Parliament2 Developer Readme

## Adding a structural variant caller

Parliament2 is currently optimized to run efficiently at scale with a number of structural variant callers. As a result, some SV callers have been excluded due to their longer runtimes. However, if you are not running Parliament2 at scale, you can add additional SV callers.

There are four main actions required in order to add an SV caller:

* Adding the SV caller and its dependencies to the Docker image
* Running the SV caller
* Converting the SV caller's outputs into VCF format
* Running SVTyper on the SV caller's outputs

### Adding the SV caller and its dependencies

If the SV caller can be installed using conda, pip, or another package installer, simply add a line reading `RUN <package_installer> install <CALLER>` to the Dockerfile. Otherwise, you will have to compile the SV caller code for an Ubuntu 14.04 machine and add it to the `resources.tar.gz` archive when building the Docker image. You can compile the SV caller code for an Ubuntu machine using a DNAnexus cloud workstation (available at https://platform.dnanexus.com/app/cloud_workstation with a DNAnexus account).

You will need to rebuild the Docker image, which can take up to 15 minutes and requires at least 5 GB of memory on your local machine, and create a DNAnexus asset from the Docker image, which can take up to an hour.

Steps involved:

* Download the Parliament2 files by running `git clone https://github.com/dnanexus/parliament2.git`. You will have to run `tar -czvf resources.tar.gz resources/` in the directory `parliament2` in order to build the Docker image. **Optional**: Add the requisite files for your SV caller into the `resources/` directory *or* modify the Dockerfile accordingly.

* Run `docker build . -t parliament2` from within the `parliament2` directory created by GitHub. There should now be a Docker image named `parliament2` on your computer. You can verify the successful installation using the command `docker images`, which will list every Docker image stored locally on your machine, or by running `docker run parliament2 -h`, which will print the help string (printed in full at the bottom of this README).

* Run `dx-docker create-asset parliament2`. This will take approximately 45 minutes and will generate a string that you can copy-paste into the `dxapp.json` file under the "Regional Options" section for your region.

* Run `dx build parliament2` to build the applet.

### Running the SV caller (`run_sv_callers.sh`)

In order to do this, you must first determine whether you can or can't parallelize the caller's execution by contig.

#### Parallelizing callers by contig

Splitting the BAM file by contig has already been taken care of; lines 103-167 comprise the block of code dedicated to running these callers.

You will need to modify the following sections:

* The `if` statement under the section "Process management for launching jobs"
* The "thread-checking" section

You will need to add the following lines:

* A check to see if the caller is being run (`if [[ "$run_CALLER" == "true" ]]`)
* Running the caller on a single contig with a timeout of 6h (`timeout 6h CALLER`)
* Defining a command to merge later (`CALLER_concat="$CALLER_concat CALLER.$count.vcf"`)

The best thing to do is to emulate how other callers are being run.

#### Running other callers

If the caller has a built-in method for parallelization, you can run it outside of the code block that splits the BAM file by contig.

You will need to add the following lines:

* A check to see if the caller is being run (`if [[ "$run_CALLER" == "true" ]]`)
* Running the caller

Examples of running other callers are demonstrated in the lines of code running BreakSeq and Manta.

### Converting the SV caller's outputs into VCF format (if applicable) (`convert_to_vcf.sh`)

In order to run SVTyper on the SV caller's outputs, they must first be converted to VCF format. This varies depending on whether the caller has been parallelized by contig or not.

#### Parallelized by contig

You will need to add the following lines:

* A check to see if the caller is being run (`if [[ "$run_CALLER" == "true" ]]`)
* A concatenation of the various files produced by the caller (`python /convertHeader.py "$prefix" "$CALLER_concat" | vcf-sort -c | uniq > CALLER.vcf`)
* Make a copy of the VCF file to add the prefix for upload (`cp CALLER.vcf "$prefix".CALLER.vcf`)
* Upload the VCF file

#### Callers run normally

If the caller's output files have not been split by contig, and the caller already produces outputs in VCF format, there is no need to do anything.

However, if the caller produces outputs in non-VCF format, you will have to write your own conversion script to convert the outputs to VCF format.

### Running SVTyper on the SV caller's outputs (`run_svtyper.sh`)

You will need to add the following lines:

* A check to see if the caller is being run (`if [[ "$run_CALLER" == "true" ]]`)
* A `mkdir` to capture SVTyper's outputs (`mkdir svtype_CALLER`)
* Running SVTyper itself (`timeout -k 500 60m ./parallelize_svtyper.sh /home/dnanexus/CALLER.vcf /home/dnanexus/svtype_CALLER /home/dnanexus/CALLER.svtyped.vcf input.bam`)

## What does this app do?

This app runs a combination of tools to generate structural variant calls on whole-genome sequencing data. This tool runs the following callers: Breakdancer, Breakseq2, CNVnator, Delly2, Manta, and Lumpy. Because of synergies in how the programs use computational resources, these are all run in parallel. This app will produce the outputs of each of the tools for subsequent investigation.

If the option to genotype candidates is selected, this app will run SVTyper to genotype the events and will merge these tools with the program SURVIVOR. SV events that receive genotype calls have significantly higher specificity.

If the option to visualize candidates is selected, a tar file containing a PDF image for each SV call will be produced in order to summarize the supporting information behind the SV.

## What are typical use cases for this app?

This app is used to identify structural variants in a given sample relative to a reference genome. These structural variants cover large deletion events that are called as Deletions of a region, Insertions of a sequence into a region, Duplications of a region, Inversions of a region, or Translocations between two regions in the genome.

## What data are required for this app to run?

This app requires a BAM file containing the mapped reads of an individual relative to the reference genome. This app is intended for whole-genome sequencing. Providing exome or panel sequencing will not produce good results. It is intended to be run on a single germline sample.

In addition, the app requires the reference genome in gzipped FASTA format (`fa.gz` or `fasta.gz`). The reference genome should match the version used to generate the BAM file.

## What does this app output?

This app will output a number of files, representing the outputs of each of the structural variant callers. If the option to run a given step is unselected, then those outputs will not be provided.

- `lumpy.vcf`: representing the structural variant calls from Lumpy in VCF format.
- `lumpy.discordant.bam`: representing reads that Lumpy identified as discordant and used as evidence for its calls.
- `lumpy.splitters.bam`: representing reads that Lumpy identified as split-read mapped and used as evidence for its calls.
- `manta.diploidSV.vcf`: representing genotyped structural variant calls from Manta in VCF format.
- `manta.alignmentStats.txt`: representing statistics about the alignment from Manta.
- `breakdancer.ctx`: representing structural variant calls in Breakdancer's format.
- `cnvnator.output`: representing structural variant calls in CNVnator's format.
- `cnvnator.vcf`: representing structural variant calls from CNVnator in VCF format (this represents the conversion of CNVnator output to VCF format).
- `breakseq.gff`: representing structural variant calls from Breakseq2 in GFF format.
- `breakseq.vcf`: representing structural variant calls from Breakseq2 in VCF format.
- `breakseq.bam`: representing the reads mapping used as evidence for the calls generated by Breakseq2.
- `delly.deletion.vcf`: representing deletion calls made by Delly2.
- `delly.inversion.vcf`: representing inversion calls made by Delly2.
- `delly.duplication.vcf`: representing duplication calls made by Delly2.
- `delly.insertion.vcf`: representing insertion calls made by Delly2.
- `delly.translocation.vcf`: representing translocation calls made by Delly2.

- `<caller>.svtyped.vcf`: If the option to genotype candidates is selected, a genotype VCF produced by svtyper will be generated for each caller output.
- `combined.genotyped.vcf`: If the option to genotype candidates is selected, a merged VCF file of all of the callers will be produced by SURVIVOR.

- `svviz_outputs.tar.gz`: If the option to visualize events is selected, a tarball containing a set of PDFs documenting the genomic regions for calls will be generated

## Additional Notes

Because the field of structural variation is relatively new and complex, we viewed placing a dependency on all individual tools completing successfully as a requirement for a successful run to be too strict. In other words, if one of these tools fails while the others succeed, the app will output the results of the tools that completed and will not itself fail.

Breakseq2 may only be able to work when using the 1000 Genomes reference genome (hs37d5). For other reference genomes, you may not get Breakseq2 results.

The svviz tool can at times consume a large amount of memory, causing the application to be killed. If you see 
a message like:

*NOTE: This is LUMPY 0.2.13 with additional changes to allow lumpyexpress to function when the main file is a CRAM, not a BAM. The splitters and discordants must still be BAM files as LUMPY itself doesn't yet support CRAM as an input. This requires the hexdump command be available.*

## LUMPY Express usage
Automated breakpoint detection for standard analyses.

```
usage:   lumpyexpress [options]
```

**Required arguments**
```
     -B FILE  coordinate-sorted BAM file(s) (comma separated)
     -S FILE  split reads BAM file(s) (comma separated)
     -D FILE  discordant reads BAM files(s) (comma separated)

```

**Optional arguments**
```
-o STR    output [fullBam.bam.vcf]
-x FILE   BED file to exclude
-P        output probability curves for each variant
-m INT    minimum sample weight for a call [4]
-r FLOAT  trim threshold [0]
-T DIR    temp directory [./output_prefix.XXXXXXXXXXXX]
-k        keep temporary files
-K FILE   path to lumpyexpress.config file
            (default: same directory as lumpyexpress)
-v        verbose
-h        show this message
```

#### Configuration
LUMPY Express runs several external program whose paths are specified in
[scripts/lumpyexpress.config](scripts/lumpyexpress.config). This config
must reside in the same directory as lumpyexpress, or be specified explicitly
with the -K flag.

The installation Makefile auto-generates a lumpyexpress.config file
and places it in the "bin" directory.

#### Input
LUMPY Express expects BWA-MEM aligned BAM files as input.
It automatically parses sample, library, and read group information using the @RG
tags in the BAM header.
Each BAM file is expected to contain exactly one sample.

The minimum input is a coordinate-sorted BAM file (-B), from which LUMPY Express
extracts splitters and discordants using SAMBLASTER before running LUMPY.
Optionally, users may supply coordinate-sorted splitter (-S) and discordant (-D)
BAM files which will bypass SAMBLASTER extraction for faster analysis.

#### Output
LUMPY Express produces a VCF file according to [VCF spec 4.2](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf).

## LUMPY (traditional) usage
Flexible and customizable breakpoint detection for advanced users.

```
usage:    lumpy [options]
```

**Options**
```
-g       Genome file (defines chromosome order)
-e       Show evidence for each call
-w       File read windows size (default 1000000)
-mw      minimum weight across all samples for a call
-msw     minimum per-sample weight for a call
-tt      trim threshold
-x       exclude file bed file
-t       temp file prefix, must be to a writeable directory
-P       output probability curve for each variant

-bedpe   bedpe_file:<bedpe file>,
         id:<sample name>,

```

## Example workflows

#### Pre-processing
We recommend aligning data with [SpeedSeq](https://github.com/cc2qe/speedseq), which
performs BWA-MEM alignment, marks duplicates and extracts split and discordant
read-pairs.
```
speedseq align -R "@RG\tID:id\tSM:sample\tLB:lib" \
    human_g1k_v37.fasta \
    sample.1.fq \
    sample.2.fq
```

Otherwise, data may be aligned with BWA-MEM.

```
# Align the data
bwa mem -R "@RG\tID:id\tSM:sample\tLB:lib" human_g1k_v37.fasta sample.1.fq sample.2.fq \
    | samblaster --excludeDups --addMateTags --maxSplitCount 2 --minNonOverlap 20 \
    | samtools view -S -b - \
    > sample.bam

# Extract the discordant paired-end alignments.
samtools view -b -F 1294 sample.bam > sample.discordants.unsorted.bam

# Extract the split-read alignments
samtools view -h sample.bam \
    | scripts/extractSplitReads_BwaMem -i stdin \
    | samtools view -Sb - \
    > sample.splitters.unsorted.bam

# Sort both alignments
samtools sort sample.discordants.unsorted.bam sample.discordants
samtools sort sample.splitters.unsorted.bam sample.splitters
```

#### Running LUMPY
LUMPY has two distinct execution alternatives. LUMPY Express is a simplified wrapper for standard analyses.
LUMPY (traditional) is more customizable, for advanced users and specialized experiments.

##### LUMPY Express
- Run LUMPY Express on a single sample with pre-extracted splitters and discordants
    ```
    lumpyexpress \
        -B sample.bam \
        -S sample.splitters.bam \
        -D sample.discordants.bam \
        -o sample.vcf
    ```

- Run LUMPY Express jointly on multiple samples with pre-extracted splitters and discordants
    ```
    lumpyexpress \
        -B sample1.bam,sample2.bam,sample3.bam \
        -S sample1.splitters.bam,sample2.splitters.bam,sample3.splitters.bam \
        -D sample1.discordants.bam,sample2.discordants.bam,sample3.discordants.bam \
        -o multi_sample.vcf
    ```

- Run LUMPY Express on a tumor-normal pair
    ```
    lumpyexpress \
        -B tumor.bam,normal.bam \
        -S tumor.splitters.bam,normal.splitters.bam \
        -D tumor.discordants.bam,normal.discordants.bam \
        -o tumor_normal.vcf
    ```

##### LUMPY (traditional)
First, generate empirical insert size statistics on each library in the BAM file
```
samtools view -r readgroup1 sample.bam \
    | tail -n+100000 \
    | scripts/pairend_distro.py \
    -r 101 \
    -X 4 \
    -N 10000 \
    -o sample.lib1.histo
```
The above script (scripts/pairend_distro.py) will display mean and stdev to screen.
For these examples we will assume the mean is 500 and the stdev is 50.

- Run LUMPY with paired-end and split-reads.
    ```
    lumpy \
        -mw 4 \
        -tt 0 \
        -pe id:sample,bam_file:sample.discordants.bam,histo_file:sample.lib1.histo,mean:500,stdev:50,read_length:101,min_non_overlap:101,discordant_z:5,back_distance:10,weight:1,min_mapping_threshold:20 \
        -sr id:sample,bam_file:sample.splitters.bam,back_distance:10,weight:1,min_mapping_threshold:20 \
        > sample.vcf
    ```

- Run LUMPY on a BAM file with multiple libraries.
    ```
    lumpy \
        -mw 4 \
        -tt 0 \
        -pe id:sample,read_group:rg1,bam_file:sample.discordants.bam,histo_file:sample.lib1.histo,mean:500,stdev:50,read_length:101,min_non_overlap:101,discordant_z:5,back_distance:10,weight:1,min_mapping_threshold:20 \
        -pe id:sample,read_group:rg2,bam_file:sample.discordants.bam,histo_file:sample.lib2.histo,mean:500,stdev:50,read_length:101,min_non_overlap:101,discordant_z:5,back_distance:10,weight:1,min_mapping_threshold:20 \
        -sr id:sample,bam_file:sample.splitters.bam,back_distance:10,weight:1,min_mapping_threshold:20 \
        > sample.vcf
    ```

- Run LUMPY on multiple samples with multiple libraries.
    ```
    lumpy \
        -mw 4 \
        -tt 0 \
        -pe id:sample1,bam_file:sample1.discordants.bam,read_group:rg1,read_group:rg2,histo_file:sample1.lib1.histo,mean:500,stdev:50,read_length:101,min_non_overlap:101,discordant_z:5,back_distance:10,weight:1,min_mapping_threshold:20 \
        -pe id:sample1,bam_file:sample1.discordants.bam,read_group:rg3,histo_file:sample1.lib2.histo,mean:500,stdev:50,read_length:101,min_non_overlap:101,discordant_z:5,back_distance:10,weight:1,min_mapping_threshold:20 \
        -pe id:sample2,bam_file:sample2.discordants.bam,read_group:rg4,histo_file:sample2.lib1.histo,mean:500,stdev:50,read_length:101,min_non_overlap:101,discordant_z:5,back_distance:10,weight:1,min_mapping_threshold:20 \
        -sr id:sample1,bam_file:sample1.splitters.bam,back_distance:10,weight:1,min_mapping_threshold:20 \
        -sr id:sample2,bam_file:sample2.splitters.bam,back_distance:10,weight:1,min_mapping_threshold:20 \
        > multi_sample.vcf
    ```

- Run LUMPY with low complexity regions excluded.  
    Heng Li provides a set of low complexity regions in the supplementary information of his paper, "Toward better
    understanding of artifacts in variant calling from high-coverage samples" at
    https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btu356. 
    ```
    unzip btu356_Supplementary_Data.zip
    unzip btu356-suppl_data.zip
    lumpy \
        -mw 4 \
        -tt 0.0 \
        -x btu356_LCR-hs37d5.bed/btu356_LCR-hs37d5.bed \
        -pe bam_file:sample.discordants.bam,histo_file:sample.pe.histo,mean:500,stdev:50,read_length:101,min_non_overlap:101,discordant_z:5,back_distance:10,weight:1,id:sample,min_mapping_threshold:1 \
        -sr bam_file:sample.sr.sort.bam,back_distance:10,weight:1,id:sample,min_mapping_threshold:1 \
        > sample.exclude.vcf
    ```
- Run LUMPY with regions of very high coverage excluded.  
    We can direct lumpy to ignore certain regions by using the
    exclude region option. In this example we find and then
    exclude regions that have very high coverage. First we
    use the get_coverages.py script to find the min, max, and
    mean coverages of the the sr and pe bam files, and to
    create coverage profiles for both files.

    ```
    python ../scripts/get_coverages.py \
        sample.pe.sort.bam \
	sample.sr.sort.bam
    # sample.pe.sort.bam.coverage  min:1   max:14  mean(non-zero):2.35557521272
    # sample.sr.sort.bam.coverage  min:1   max:7   mean(non-zero):1.08945936729
    ```
    
    From this output, we will choose to exclude regions that
    have more than 10x coverage.  To create the exclude file
    we will use the get_exclude_regions.py script to create
    the exclude.bed file
    ```
    python ../scripts/get_exclude_regions.py \
        10 \
	exclude.bed \
	sample.pe.sort.bam \
	sample.sr.sort.bam
    ```

    We now rerun lumpy with the exclude (-x) option
    ```
    lumpy \
        -mw 4 \
        -tt 0.0 \
        -x exclude.bed \
        -pe bam_file:sample.discordants.bam,histo_file:sample.pe.histo,mean:500,stdev:50,read_length:101,min_non_overlap:101,discordant_z:5,back_distance:10,weight:1,id:sample,min_mapping_threshold:1 \
        -sr bam_file:sample.sr.sort.bam,back_distance:10,weight:1,id:sample,min_mapping_threshold:1 \
        > sample.exclude.vcf
    ```

#### Post-processing
[SVTyper](https://github.com/cc2qe/svtyper) can call genotypes on LUMPY output VCF files
using a Bayesian maximum likelihood algorithm.
```
svtyper \      
    -B sample.bam \
    -S sample.splitters.bam \
    -i sample.vcf
    > sample.gt.vcf
```

## Test data
The `test/test.sh` script executes lumpy against several simulated data sets
and compares the results to the known correct result.  The sample data sets can
be found at http://layerlab.org/lumpy/data.tar.gz.  This tar ball should be
extracted into the top-level lumpy directory.  The script `test/test.sh` checks
for the the existence of this directory before running LUMPY.

## Troubleshooting
All of the bam files that lumpy processes must be position sorted. To check if your bams are sorted correctly, use the check_sorting.py script
```
python ../scripts/check_sorting.py \
    pe.pos_sorted.bam \
    sr.pos_sorted.bam \
    pe.name_sorted.bam
# pe.pos_sorted.bam
# in order
# sr.pos_sorted.bam
# in order
# pe.name_sorted.bam
# out of order:   chr10   102292476   occurred after   chr10   102292893
```
Thread pool tests
=================
The thread_pool.c file has a built-in test program which is enabled when compiling with TEST_MAIN defined. The test program can be run in four different modes by giving a command-line parameter: unordered, ordered1, ordered2, and pipe. The modes and their expected outputs are described below.

unordered
---------
Dispatches TASK_SIZE (=1000) jobs to the thread pool and waits for them to finish. The job index (0..TASK_SIZE-1) is passed as a parameter. The job function is doit_square_u, which sleeps for a while and then prints the square of its input parameter to stdout.

Expected output when n = 1:
```
RESULT: 0
...
RESULT: 998001
```

Expected output when n > 1: same, but in jumbled up order.

ordered1
--------
Dispatches TASK_SIZE (=1000) jobs to the thread pool in non-blocking mode. Results are returned on the result queue and are pulled in order. The job index (0..TASK_SIZE-1) is passed as a parameter. The job function is doit_square, which sleeps for a while and then returns the square of its input parameter as a result. Some of the jobs take way longer than the others to finish.

The expected output is the results printed in order, regardless of n.

ordered2
--------
Starts a dispatcher thread which dispatches jobs to the thread pool. After all regular jobs have been dispatched, a sentinel job follows where the input parameter is set to -1, which receives special handling in doit_square to return the -1 as the result.

Results are consumed on the main thread using hts_tpool_next_result_wait, until the end-of-job marker is found.

The expected output is the results printed in order, regardless of n.

pipe
----
This program uses one thread pool (hts_tpool) and three queues (hts_tpool_process) shared across threads using a pipe_opt struct. There are four threads: input, stage1to2, stage2to3, and output.

The input thread (pipe_input_thread procedure) dispatches jobs to the thread pool with the job number (1..TASK_SIZE) and an end-of-job flag as parameters. The jobs are executed by the pipe_stage1 procedure, which multiplies by 256 and sleeps for a short while.

The stage1to2 thread (pipe_stage1to2 procedure) pulls results from the first queue (q1) and passes them to new jobs in the thread pool. These jobs are executed by the pipe_stage2 procedure, which does the same as pipe_stage1, only slower.

The stage2to3 thread is similar to the stage1to2 thread. It pulls from the second queue and dispatches new jobs to be executed by the pipe_stage3 procedure. pipe_stage3 is similar to pipe_stage1.

The output thread pulls from the third queue.

Expected output:
```
I 00000001
1 00000100
2 00010000
O 01000000
...
I 000003e8
1 0003e800
2 03e80000
O e8000000
```
...but not in order, because the input queues might be served in any order.

However, if only the lines from the output thread are printed, they should be in order regardless of the number of threads.

Set up the ROOT environment (`. $ROOTSYS/bin/thisroot.[c]sh`) and type in your
shell:
```
root --notebook
```
This will start a ROOT-flavoured notebook server in your computer.

Alternatively, if you would like to use the Jupyter command directly, you 
can do on Linux:
```
cp -r $ROOTSYS/etc/notebook/kernels/root ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels
jupyter notebook
```
and on OSx:
```
cp -r $ROOTSYS/etc/notebook/kernels/root /Users/$USER/Library/Jupyter/kernels/
jupyter notebook
```

Once the server is up, you can use ROOT with two kernels:

1. ROOT C++: new kernel provided by ROOT
2. Python 2: already provided by Jupyter

##  C++ ROOTbook
ROOT offers a C++ kernel that transforms the notebook in a ROOT prompt.
Embedded graphics, syntax highlighting and tab completion are among
the features provided by this kernel.

An example of how you would plot a histogram in a C++ ROOTbook is:
```cpp
TCanvas c;
TH1F h("h","ROOT Histo;X;Y",64,-4,4);
h.FillRandom("gaus");
h.Draw();
c.Draw();
``` 

## Python ROOTbook
If you prefer to use Python, you can create a new Python 2 kernel and
import the ROOT libraries:
```python
import ROOT
```
And then you could write something like:
```python
c = ROOT.TCanvas("c")
h = ROOT.TH1F("h","ROOT Histo;X;Y",64,-4,4)
```
Additionally, you can mix Python and C++ in the same notebook
by using the **%%cpp** magic:
```cpp
%%cpp
h->FillRandom("gaus");
h->Draw();
c->Draw();
```

   This let add more custom elements to the generic gui, implemented with JSROOT.HierarchyPainter   
3. Provide full support of require.js. One could load now JSRootCore.js script like:

      <script type="text/javascript" src="require.js" data-main="scripts/JSRootCore.js"></script>
      
   After this several modules are defined and can be used with syntax like:
   
      require(['JSRootPainter'], function(jsroot) { /*any user code*/});
      
   Also inside JSROOT require.js used to load all dependencies. 


## Changes in 3.6

   update view of displayed object (_update_item property)    
5. Use HiearchyPainter for implementing draw.htm. This let us handle
   all different kinds of extra attributes in central place 
6. Fix problem in tabs layout - new tab should be add to direct child
7. When drawing several tabs, activate frame before drawing - only then
   real frame size will be set
8. Fix problem with GetBBox - it only can be used for visible elements in mozilla.    
9. Support drawing of fit parameters in stat box, use (as far as possible) stat and
   fit format for statistic display 
10. Implement 'g' formatting kind for stat box output - one need to checks 
    significant digits when producing output.  
11. Support new draw options for TGraph: 'C', 'B1', '0', '2', '3', '4', '[]'
12. Primary support for STL containers in IO part. Allows to read ROOT6 TF1.
13. Full support of TGraphBentErrors
14. Support objects drawing from JSON files in default user interface, including
    monitoring. One could open file from link like: https://root.cern.ch/js/dev/?json=demo/canvas_tf1.json 
15. Introduce JSROOT.FFormat function to convert numeric values into string according
    format like 6.4g or 5.7e. Used for statistic display.

   usage of jquery.js in core JSROOT classes
3. Implement main graphics without jquery at all,
   such mode used in `nobrowser` mode.
4. Provide optional latex drawing with MathJax SVG.
   TMathText always drawn with MathJax,
   other classes require `mathjax` option in URL
5. Improve drawing of different text classes, correctly handle
   their alignment and scaling, special handling for IE

    similar items from different files. Could be used in URL like:
      `...&files=[file1.root,file2.root]&items=[file1.root/hpx, file2.root/_same_]`
      `...&files=[file1.root,file2.root]&item=file1.root/hpx+file2.root/_same_`
    Main limitation - file names should have similar length.
11. When 'autozoom' specified in draw options, histogram zoomed into
    non-empty content. Same command available via context menu.
12. Item of 'Text' kind can be created. It is displayed as
    plain text in the browser. If property 'mathjax' specified,
    MathJax.js library will be loaded and used for rendering.
    See httpcontrol.C macro for example.
13. When using foreignObject, provide workaround for absolute positioning
    problem in Chrome/Safari, see <http://bit.ly/1wjqCQ9>

    All major draw functions working with HTML element id as first argument.
9.  Extract 3D drawings into separate JSRoot3DPainter.js script
10. Use newest three.min.js (r68) for 3D drawings, solves problem with Firefox.
11. Introduce generic list of draw functions for all supported classes.
12. Add possibility to 'expand' normal objects in the hierarchy browser.
    For instance, this gives access to single elements of canvas,
    when whole canvas cannot be drawn.
13. Correct usage of colors map, provided with TCanvas.
14. Introduce JSROOT.redraw() function which is capable to create or update object drawing.
15. In main index.htm page browser can be disabled (nobrowser parameter) and
    page can be used to display only specified items from the file
16. Add support of TPolyMarker3D in binary I/O

### September 2014
1. First try to handle resize of the browser,
   for the moment works only with collapsible layout
2. Also first try to interactively move separation line between
   browser and drawing field.
3. Small fix of minor ticks drawing on the axis
4. Introduce display class for MDI drawing. Provide two implementations -
   'collapsible' for old kind and 'tabs' for new kinds.
5. Adjust size of color palette drawing when labels would take more place as provided.
6. Add correct filling of statistic for TProfile,
   fix small problem with underflow/overflow bins.
7. Provide way to select display kind ('collapsible', 'tabs') in the simple GUI.
8. Implement 'grid' display, one could specify any number of division like
   'grid 3x3' or 'grid 4x2'.
9. MDI display object created at the moment when first draw is performed.
10. Introduce painter class for TCanvas, support resize and update of canvas drawing
11. Resize almost works for all layouts and all objects kinds.
12. Implement JSROOT.GetUrlOption to extract options from document URL.
13. Provide example fileitem.htm how read and display item from ROOT file.
14. In default index.htm page one could specify 'file', 'layout',
    'item' and 'items' parameters like:
      <http://root.cern.ch/js/3.0/index.htm?file=../files/hsimple.root&layout=grid3x2&item=hpx;1>
15. Support direct reading of objects from sub-sub-directories.
16. Introduce demo.htm, which demonstrates online usage of JSROOT.
17. One could use demo.htm directly with THttpServer providing address like:
     <http://localhost:8080/jsrootsys/demo/demo.htm?addr=../../Files/job1.root/hpx/root.json.gz&layout=3x3>
18. Also for online server process url options like 'item', 'items', 'layout'
19. Possibility to generate URL, which reproduces opened page with layout and drawn items

### August 2014
1. All communication between server and browser done with JSON format.
2. Fix small error in dtree.js - one should always set
   last sibling (_ls) property while tree can be dynamically changed.
3. In JSRootCore.js provide central function, which handles different kinds
   of XMLHttpRequest.  Use only async requests, also when getting file header.
4. Fully reorganize data management in file/tree/directory/collection hierarchical
   display. Now complete description collected in HPainter class and decoupled from
   visualization, performed with dTree.js.
5. Remove all global variables from the code.
6. Automatic scripts/style loading handled via JSROOT.loadScript() function.
   One can specify arbitrary scripts list, which asynchronously loaded by browser.
7. Method to build simple GUI changed and more simplified :). The example in index.htm.
   While loadScript and AssertPrerequisites functions moved to JSROOT, one
   can easily build many different kinds of GUIs, reusing provided JSRootCore.js functions.
8. In example.htm also use AssertPrerequisites to load necessary scripts.
   This helps to keep code up-to-date even by big changes in JavaScript code.
9. Provide monitoring of online THttpServer with similar interface as for ROOT files.
10. Fix several errors in TKey Streamer, use member names as in ROOT itself.
11. Keep the only version identifier JSROOT.version for JS code
12. One can specify in JSROOT.AssertPrerequisites functionality which is required.
    One could specify '2d', 'io' (default) or '3d'.
13. Use new AssertPrerequisites functionality to load only required functionality.
14. When displaying single element, one could specify draw options and monitor property like:
        <http://localhost:8080/Files/job1.root/hpxpy/draw.htm?opt=col&monitor=2000>
     Such link is best possibility to integrate display into different HTML pages,
     using `<iframe/>` tag like:
        `<iframe src="http://localhost:8080/Files/job1.root/hpx/draw.htm"` 
          `style="width: 800px; height:600px"></iframe>`
15. Remove 'JSROOTIO.' prefix from _typename. Now real class name is used.
16. Use in all scripts JSROOT as central 'namespace'
17. Introduce context menu in 3D, use it for switch between 2D/3D modes
18. Use own code to generate hierarchical structure in HTML, replace dtree.js which is
    extremely slow for complex hierarchies. Dramatically improve performance for
    structures with large (~1000) number of items.
19. Deliver to the server title of the objects, display it as hint in the browser.
20. Better handling of special characters in the hierarchies - allows to display
    symbols like ' or " in the file structure.

### July 2014
1. Migration to d3.v3.js and jQuery v2.1.1
2. Fix errors in filling of histogram statbox
3. Possibility of move and resize of statbox, title, color palete
4. Remove many (not all) global variables
5. Example with direct usage of JSRootIO graphics
6. Example of inserting ROOT graphics from THttpServer into `<iframe></iframe>`

### May 2014
1. This JSRootIO code together with THttpServer class included
   in ROOT repository

### March 2014
1. Introduce JSROOT.TBuffer class, which plays similar role
   as TBuffer in native ROOT I/O. Simplifies I/O logic,
   reduce duplication of code in many places, fix errors.
   Main advantage - one could try to keep code synchronous with C++.
2. Avoid objects cloning when object referenced several times.
3. Treat special cases (collection, arrays) in one place.
   This is major advantage, while any new classes need to be implemented only once.
4. Object representation, produced by JSRootIO is similar to
   objects, produced by TBufferJSON class. By this one can exchange
   I/O engine and use same JavaSctript graphic for display.
5. More clear functions to display different elements of the file.
   In the future functions should be fully separated from I/O part
   and organized in similar way as online part.
6. Eliminate usage of gFile pointer in the I/O part.
7. Provide TBufferJSON::JsonWriteMember method. It allows to stream any
   selected data member of the class. Supported are:
   basic data types, arrays of basic data types, TString, TArray classes.
   Also any object as data member can be streamed.
8. TRootSniffer do not creates sublevels for base classes
# JupyROOT
A software layer to integrate Jupyter notebooks and ROOT.

## Installation
1. [Install ROOT6](https://root.cern.ch/building-root) (> 6.05)
2. Install dependencies: pip install jupyter metakernel

## Start using ROOTbooks
Set up the ROOT environment (`. $ROOTSYS/bin/thisroot.[c]sh`) and type in your
shell:
```
root --notebook
```
This will start a ROOT-flavoured notebook server in your computer.

Alternatively, if you would like to use the Jupyter command directly, you 
can do on Linux:
```
cp -r $ROOTSYS/etc/notebook/kernels/root ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels
jupyter notebook
```
and on OSx:
```
cp -r $ROOTSYS/etc/notebook/kernels/root /Users/$USER/Library/Jupyter/kernels/
jupyter notebook
```

Once the server is up, you can use ROOT with two kernels:

1. ROOT C++: new kernel provided by ROOT
2. Python 2: already provided by Jupyter

##  C++ ROOTbook
ROOT offers a C++ kernel that transforms the notebook in a ROOT prompt.
Embedded graphics, syntax highlighting and tab completion are among
the features provided by this kernel.

An example of how you would plot a histogram in a C++ ROOTbook is:
```cpp
TCanvas c;
TH1F h("h","ROOT Histo;X;Y",64,-4,4);
h.FillRandom("gaus");
h.Draw();
c.Draw();
``` 

## Python ROOTbook
If you prefer to use Python, you can create a new Python 2 kernel and
import the ROOT libraries:
```python
import ROOT
```
And then you could write something like:
```python
c = ROOT.TCanvas("c")
h = ROOT.TH1F("h","ROOT Histo;X;Y",64,-4,4)
```
Additionally, you can mix Python and C++ in the same notebook
by using the **%%cpp** magic:
```cpp
%%cpp
h->FillRandom("gaus");
h->Draw();
c->Draw();
```
The structure of this directory is as follows:

```
.
├── 1000_genomes
│   ├── 1000_genomes # output VCFs from 1KGBP data
│   └── 1000_genomes_pass # output VCFs from 1KBP data that had a quality value above the PASS threshold
├── dx_job_logs # logs from the DNAnexus jobs run for the benchmarking

 Index and Search
 ################

 * :ref:`genindex`
 * :ref:`search`
CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS
--------------------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS` target property.
This variable is used to initialize the property on each target as it is
created.
CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_SUFFIX
--------------------------

The suffix for shared libraries that you link to.

The suffix to use for the end of a loadable module filename on this
platform

``CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_SUFFIX_<LANG>`` overrides this for language ``<LANG>``.
CTEST_EXTRA_COVERAGE_GLOB
-------------------------

A list of regular expressions which will be used to find files which should be
covered by the :command:`ctest_coverage` command.

.. include:: CTEST_CUSTOM_XXX.txt
CMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS
------------------------

This variable has no effect.  The partially implemented effect it
had in previous releases was removed in CMake 3.4.
CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT
--------------------------------

Value used to initialize the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>` cache
entry the first time a build tree is configured for language ``<LANG>``.
This variable is meant to be set by a :variable:`toolchain file
<CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`.  CMake may prepend or append content to
the value based on the environment and target platform.

See also :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_INIT`.
CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH
------------------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories to be *ignored* by
the :command:`find_program`, :command:`find_library`, :command:`find_file`,
and :command:`find_path` commands.  This is useful in cross-compiling
environments where some system directories contain incompatible but
possibly linkable libraries.  For example, on cross-compiled cluster
environments, this allows a user to ignore directories containing
libraries meant for the front-end machine.

By default this contains a list of directories containing incompatible
binaries for the host system.  See the :variable:`CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH` variable
that is intended to be set by the project.

See also the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH`,
:variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH`, :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH`,
and :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH` variables.
CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_TYPE
----------------------

Specify the CTest ``MemoryCheckType`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
Valid values are ``Valgrind``, ``Purify``, ``BoundsChecker``, and
``ThreadSanitizer``, ``AddressSanitizer``, ``LeakSanitizer``, ``MemorySanitizer``, and
``UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer``.
CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE
------------------------

Generator-specific instance specification provided by user.

Some CMake generators support selection of an instance of the native build
system when multiple instances are available.  If the user specifies an
instance (e.g. by setting this cache entry), or after a default instance is
chosen when a build tree is first configured, the value will be available in
this variable.

The value of this variable should never be modified by project code.
A toolchain file specified by the :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`
variable may initialize ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE`` as a cache entry.
Once a given build tree has been initialized with a particular value
for this variable, changing the value has undefined behavior.

Instance specification is supported only on specific generators:

* For the :generator:`Visual Studio 15 2017` generator (and above)
  this specifies the absolute path to the VS installation directory
  of the selected VS instance.

See native build system documentation for allowed instance values.
WINCE
-----

True when the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` variable is set
to ``WindowsCE``.
CMAKE_AUTOMOC
-------------

Whether to handle ``moc`` automatically for Qt targets.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` property on all the
targets.  See that target property for additional information.
CTEST_HG_COMMAND
----------------

Specify the CTest ``HGCommand`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
------------------------------

Where to put all the :ref:`RUNTIME <Runtime Output Artifacts>`
target files when built.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`
property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
information.
CTEST_SVN_UPDATE_OPTIONS
------------------------

Specify the CTest ``SVNUpdateOptions`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_ANDROID_JAVA_SOURCE_DIR
-----------------------------

Default value for the :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_JAVA_SOURCE_DIR` target property.
See that target property for additional information.
CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P
-------------------

Size of a ``void`` pointer.

This is set to the size of a pointer on the target machine, and is determined
by a try compile.  If a 64-bit size is found, then the library search
path is modified to look for 64-bit libraries first.
CMAKE_INTERNAL_PLATFORM_ABI
---------------------------

An internal variable subject to change.

This is used in determining the compiler ABI and is subject to change.
MSVC11
------

Discouraged.  Use the :variable:`MSVC_VERSION` variable instead.

``True`` when using the Microsoft Visual Studio ``v110`` toolset
(``cl`` version 17) or another compiler that simulates it.
CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH
---------------------------

Search path for OS X frameworks used by the :command:`find_library`,
:command:`find_package`, :command:`find_path`, and :command:`find_file`
commands.  By default it contains the standard directories for the
current system.  It is *not* intended to be modified by the project,
use :variable:`CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH` for this.
CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>
------------------------------

Default for CMake Policy ``CMP<NNNN>`` when it is otherwise left unset.

Commands :command:`cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)` and
:command:`cmake_policy(VERSION)` by default leave policies introduced after
the given version unset.  Set ``CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>`` to ``OLD``
or ``NEW`` to specify the default for policy ``CMP<NNNN>``, where ``<NNNN>``
is the policy number.

This variable should not be set by a project in CMake code; use
:command:`cmake_policy(SET)` instead.  Users running CMake may set this
variable in the cache (e.g. ``-DCMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>=<OLD|NEW>``)
to set a policy not otherwise set by the project.  Set to ``OLD`` to quiet a
policy warning while using old behavior or to ``NEW`` to try building the
project with new behavior.
CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_HOST_ARCHITECTURE
-------------------------------------------

Visual Studio preferred tool architecture.

The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2013 and above support optional
selection of a 64-bit toolchain on 64-bit hosts by specifying a ``host=x64``
value in the :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET` option.  CMake provides
the selected toolchain architecture preference in this variable (either
``x64`` or empty).
CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
------------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for the :command:`find_program` command.  By default it is empty, it is
intended to be set by the project.  See also
:variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH` and :variable:`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`.
CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC
------------------------------

Assume the linker looks for static libraries by default.

Some linkers support switches such as ``-Bstatic`` and ``-Bdynamic`` to
determine whether to use static or shared libraries for ``-lXXX`` options.
CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link
directories for the platform.  By default the linker search type is
assumed to be ``-Bdynamic`` at the beginning of the library list.  This
property switches the assumption to ``-Bstatic``.  It is intended for use
when linking an executable statically (e.g.  with the GNU ``-static``
option).

This variable is used to initialize the target property
:prop_tgt:`LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC` for all targets.  If set, it's
value is also used by the :command:`try_compile` command.

See also :variable:`CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC`.
CTEST_CUSTOM_POST_MEMCHECK
--------------------------

A list of commands to run at the end of the :command:`ctest_memcheck` command.

.. include:: CTEST_CUSTOM_XXX.txt
CTEST_UPDATE_COMMAND
--------------------

Specify the CTest ``UpdateCommand`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
------------------------------------------

Ask ``cmake_install.cmake`` script to warn each time a file with absolute
``INSTALL DESTINATION`` is encountered.

This variable is used by CMake-generated ``cmake_install.cmake`` scripts.
If one sets this variable to ``ON`` while running the script, it may get
warning messages from the script.
CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT
------------------------------------

Value used to initialize the :variable:`CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>`
cache entry the first time a build tree is configured.
This variable is meant to be set by a :variable:`toolchain file
<CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`.  CMake may prepend or append content to
the value based on the environment and target platform.

See also :variable:`CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT`.
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY
---------------------------------

.. |FIND_XXX| replace:: :command:`find_library`

.. include:: CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_XXX.txt
CMAKE_VS_SDK_LIBRARY_DIRECTORIES
--------------------------------

This variable allows to override Visual Studio default Library Directories.
CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_NAME
----------------------

Visual Studio target platform name.

VS 8 and above allow project files to specify a target platform.
CMake provides the name of the chosen platform in this variable.
See the :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM` variable for details.
CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_CUDA
------------------------------

NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit version whose Visual Studio toolset to use.

The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above support using
a CUDA toolset provided by a CUDA Toolkit.  The toolset version number
may be specified by a field in :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET` of
the form ``cuda=8.0``.  If none is specified CMake will choose a default
version.  CMake provides the selected CUDA toolset version in this variable.
The value may be empty if no CUDA Toolkit with Visual Studio integration
is installed.
CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_EXECUTABLE
----------------------------

Rule variable to link an executable.

Rule variable to link an executable for the given language.
CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_SUPPRESSIONS_FILE
-----------------------------------

Specify the CTest ``MemoryCheckSuppressionFile`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION
-----------------------------

Compiler version string.

Compiler version in major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]] format.  This
variable is not guaranteed to be defined for all compilers or
languages.

For example ``CMAKE_C_COMPILER_VERSION`` and
``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_VERSION`` might indicate the respective C and C++
compiler version.
CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION
-------------------

First version number component of the :variable:`CMAKE_VERSION`
variable.
MSVC14
------

Discouraged.  Use the :variable:`MSVC_VERSION` variable instead.

``True`` when using the Microsoft Visual Studio ``v140`` or ``v141``
toolset (``cl`` version 19) or another compiler that simulates it.
CMAKE_ANDROID_ARM_NEON
----------------------

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android` and :variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH_ABI`
is set to ``armeabi-v7a`` set ``CMAKE_ANDROID_ARM_NEON`` to ``ON`` to target
ARM NEON devices.
PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH
---------------------

Third version number component of the :variable:`PROJECT_VERSION`
variable as set by the :command:`project` command.
CMAKE_CODELITE_USE_TARGETS
--------------------------

Change the way the CodeLite generator creates projectfiles.

If this variable evaluates to ``ON`` at the end of the top-level
``CMakeLists.txt`` file, the generator creates projectfiles based on targets
rather than projects.
CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_RELEASE_INIT
-------------------------------

This variable is the ``Release`` variant of the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT` variable.
CTEST_CVS_COMMAND
-----------------

Specify the CTest ``CVSCommand`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR
---------------------------

The name of the CPU CMake is running on.

On systems that support ``uname``, this variable is set to the output of
``uname -p``.  On Windows it is set to the value of the environment variable
``PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE``.
CMAKE_MFC_FLAG
--------------

Tell cmake to use MFC for an executable or dll.

This can be set in a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file and will enable MFC in the
application.  It should be set to ``1`` for the static MFC library, and ``2``
for the shared MFC library.  This is used in Visual Studio
project files.  The CMakeSetup dialog used MFC and the ``CMakeLists.txt``
looks like this:

::

  add_definitions(-D_AFXDLL)
  set(CMAKE_MFC_FLAG 2)
  add_executable(CMakeSetup WIN32 ${SRCS})
CMAKE_ARGC
----------

Number of command line arguments passed to CMake in script mode.

When run in :ref:`-P <CMake Options>` script mode, CMake sets this variable to
the number of command line arguments.  See also :variable:`CMAKE_ARGV0`,
``1``, ``2`` ...
CMAKE_ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DIRECTORIES
------------------------------------

Default value for the :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DIRECTORIES` target
property.  See that target property for additional information.

-------------

True when the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` variable is set
to ``WindowsStore``.
CMAKE_<LANG>_GHS_KERNEL_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO
--------------------------------------------

This variable is the ``RelWithDebInfo`` variant of the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_GHS_KERNEL_FLAGS_<CONFIG>` variable.
CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS
--------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`CXX_EXTENSIONS` property of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`CXX_EXTENSIONS`
property on all targets.  See that target property for additional
information.

See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
CMAKE_ANDROID_SECURE_PROPS_PATH
-------------------------------

Default value for the :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_SECURE_PROPS_PATH` target property.
See that target property for additional information.
CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR
------------------------

The path to the source directory currently being processed.

This the full path to the source directory that is currently being
processed by cmake.

When run in -P script mode, CMake sets the variables
:variable:`CMAKE_BINARY_DIR`, :variable:`CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`,
:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` and
:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` to the current working directory.
CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
-------------------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for the :command:`find_file` and :command:`find_path` commands.  By default
this contains the standard directories for the current system.  It is *not*
intended to be modified by the project; use :variable:`CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH` for
this.  See also :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH`.
CTEST_P4_COMMAND
----------------

Specify the CTest ``P4Command`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE
---------------------------------

.. |FIND_XXX| replace:: :command:`find_package`

.. include:: CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_XXX.txt
WINDOWS_PHONE
-------------

True when the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` variable is set
to ``WindowsPhone``.
CPACK_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
------------------------------------------

Ask CPack to warn each time a file with absolute ``INSTALL DESTINATION`` is
encountered.

This variable triggers the definition of
:variable:`CMAKE_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION` when CPack runs
``cmake_install.cmake`` scripts.
MSVC80
------

Discouraged.  Use the :variable:`MSVC_VERSION` variable instead.

``True`` when using the Microsoft Visual Studio ``v80`` toolset
(``cl`` version 14) or another compiler that simulates it.
CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION
--------------------

The version of the operating system for which CMake is to build.
See the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` variable for the OS name.

System Version for Host Builds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` variable takes its default value
then ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION`` is by default set to the same value as the
:variable:`CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION` variable so that the build targets
the host system version.

In the case of a host build then ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION`` may be set
explicitly when first configuring a new build tree in order to enable
targeting the build for a different version of the host operating system
than is actually running on the host.  This is allowed and not considered
cross compiling so long as the binaries built for the specified OS version
can still run on the host.

System Version for Cross Compiling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` variable is set explicitly to
enable :ref:`cross compiling <Cross Compiling Toolchain>` then the
value of ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION`` must also be set explicitly to specify
the target system version.
CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS
-------------------

Specify the CTest ``UseLaunchers`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_LOADED
----------------------------

Defined to true if the language is enabled.

When language ``<LANG>`` is enabled by :command:`project` or
:command:`enable_language` this variable is defined to ``1``.
CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK
-----------------

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android with the NDK`, this variable holds
the absolute path to the root directory of the NDK.  The directory must
contain a ``platforms`` subdirectory holding the ``android-<api>``
directories.
CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO_INIT
--------------------------------------

This variable is the ``RelWithDebInfo`` variant of the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT` variable.
CMAKE_ECLIPSE_GENERATE_LINKED_RESOURCES
---------------------------------------

This cache variable is used by the Eclipse project generator.  See
:manual:`cmake-generators(7)`.

The Eclipse project generator generates so-called linked resources
e.g. to the subproject root dirs in the source tree or to the source files
of targets.
This can be disabled by setting this variable to FALSE.
CMAKE_JOB_POOLS
---------------

If the :prop_gbl:`JOB_POOLS` global property is not set, the value
of this variable is used in its place.  See :prop_gbl:`JOB_POOLS`
for additional information.
CTEST_UPDATE_OPTIONS
--------------------

Specify the CTest ``UpdateOptions`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS
-----------------------------

Enable/Disable output of compile commands during generation.

If enabled, generates a ``compile_commands.json`` file containing the exact
compiler calls for all translation units of the project in machine-readable
form.  The format of the JSON file looks like:

.. code-block:: javascript

  [
    {
      "directory": "/home/user/development/project",
      "command": "/usr/bin/c++ ... -c ../foo/foo.cc",
      "file": "../foo/foo.cc"
    },

    ...

    {
      "directory": "/home/user/development/project",
      "command": "/usr/bin/c++ ... -c ../foo/bar.cc",
      "file": "../foo/bar.cc"
    }
  ]

.. note::
  This option is implemented only by :ref:`Makefile Generators`
  and the :generator:`Ninja`.  It is ignored on other generators.
CMAKE_VERSION
-------------

The CMake version string as three non-negative integer components
separated by ``.`` and possibly followed by ``-`` and other information.
The first two components represent the feature level and the third
component represents either a bug-fix level or development date.

Release versions and release candidate versions of CMake use the format::

  <major>.<minor>.<patch>[-rc<n>]

where the ``<patch>`` component is less than ``20000000``.  Development
versions of CMake use the format::

  <major>.<minor>.<date>[-<id>]

where the ``<date>`` component is of format ``CCYYMMDD`` and ``<id>``
may contain arbitrary text.  This represents development as of a
particular date following the ``<major>.<minor>`` feature release.

Individual component values are also available in variables:

* :variable:`CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION`
* :variable:`CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION`
* :variable:`CMAKE_PATCH_VERSION`
* :variable:`CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION`

Use the :command:`if` command ``VERSION_LESS``, ``VERSION_GREATER``,
``VERSION_EQUAL``, ``VERSION_LESS_EQUAL``, or ``VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL``
operators to compare version string values against ``CMAKE_VERSION`` using a
component-wise test.  Version component values may be 10 or larger so do not
attempt to compare version strings as floating-point numbers.

.. note::

  CMake versions 2.8.2 through 2.8.12 used three components for the
  feature level.  Release versions represented the bug-fix level in a
  fourth component, i.e. ``<major>.<minor>.<patch>[.<tweak>][-rc<n>]``.
  Development versions represented the development date in the fourth
  component, i.e. ``<major>.<minor>.<patch>.<date>[-<id>]``.

  CMake versions prior to 2.8.2 used three components for the
  feature level and had no bug-fix component.  Release versions
  used an even-valued second component, i.e.
  ``<major>.<even-minor>.<patch>[-rc<n>]``.  Development versions
  used an odd-valued second component with the development date as
  the third component, i.e. ``<major>.<odd-minor>.<date>``.

  The ``CMAKE_VERSION`` variable is defined by CMake 2.6.3 and higher.
  Earlier versions defined only the individual component variables.
CMAKE_AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS
--------------------------

Search path list used by :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOUIC` to find included
``.ui`` files.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS`
property on all the targets. See that target property for additional
information.

By default it is empty.
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
-----------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying installation
*prefixes* to be searched by the :command:`find_package`,
:command:`find_program`, :command:`find_library`, :command:`find_file`, and
:command:`find_path` commands.  Each command will add appropriate
subdirectories (like ``bin``, ``lib``, or ``include``) as specified in its own
documentation.

By default this is empty.  It is intended to be set by the project.

See also :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH`, :variable:`CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH`,
:variable:`CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH`, :variable:`CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH`, and
:variable:`CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH`.
CTEST_LABELS_FOR_SUBPROJECTS
----------------------------

Specify the CTest ``LabelsForSubprojects`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH
------------------------

Do not include RPATHs in the install tree.

Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building
executables etc on systems that use RPATH.  When the software is
installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the
install RPATH.  If this variable is set to true then the software is
always installed without RPATH, even if RPATH is enabled when
building.  This can be useful for example to allow running tests from
the build directory with RPATH enabled before the installation step.
To omit RPATH in both the build and install steps, use
:variable:`CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH` instead.
CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION
-------------------

Second version number component of the :variable:`CMAKE_VERSION`
variable.
CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION
-------------------------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION`
property of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the
:prop_tgt:`DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION` property on all
targets. See that target property for additional information.

Setting ``CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION`` may be necessary
when working with ``C#`` and newer .NET framework versions to
avoid referencing errors with the ``ALL_BUILD`` CMake target.

This variable is only evaluated for :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`
VS 2010 and above.
CMAKE_<LANG>_SIMULATE_ID
------------------------

Identification string of "simulated" compiler.

Some compilers simulate other compilers to serve as drop-in
replacements.  When CMake detects such a compiler it sets this
variable to what would have been the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` for
the simulated compiler.
CMAKE_HOST_APPLE
----------------

``True`` for Apple OS X operating systems.

Set to ``true`` when the host system is Apple OS X.
CMAKE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_PROJECT_BEFORE
----------------------------------------

Whether to force prepending of project include directories.

This variable affects the order of include directories generated in compiler
command lines.  If set to ``ON``, it causes the :variable:`CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`
and the :variable:`CMAKE_BINARY_DIR` to appear first.
CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING
--------------------

Intended to indicate whether CMake is cross compiling, but note limitations
discussed below.

This variable will be set to true by CMake if the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`
variable has been set manually (i.e. in a toolchain file or as a cache entry
from the :manual:`cmake <cmake(1)>` command line). In most cases, manually
setting :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` will only be done when cross compiling,
since it will otherwise be given the same value as
:variable:`CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME` if not manually set, which is correct for
the non-cross-compiling case. In the event that :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`
is manually set to the same value as :variable:`CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME`, then
``CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING`` will still be set to true.

Another case to be aware of is that builds targeting Apple platforms other than
macOS are handled differently to other cross compiling scenarios. Rather than
relying on :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` to select the target platform, Apple
device builds use :variable:`CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT` to select the appropriate SDK,
which indirectly determines the target platform. Furthermore, when using the
Xcode generator, developers can switch between device and simulator builds at
build time rather than having a single choice at configure time, so the concept
of whether the build is cross compiling or not is more complex. Therefore, the
use of ``CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING`` is not recommended for projects targeting Apple
devices.
CMAKE_VS_SDK_REFERENCE_DIRECTORIES
----------------------------------

This variable allows to override Visual Studio default Reference Directories.
CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE
-----------------------------

Type of target generated for :command:`try_compile` calls using the
source file signature.  Valid values are:

``EXECUTABLE``
  Use :command:`add_executable` to name the source file in the
  generated project.  This is the default if no value is given.

``STATIC_LIBRARY``
  Use :command:`add_library` with the ``STATIC`` option to name the
  source file in the generated project.  This avoids running the
  linker and is intended for use with cross-compiling toolchains
  that cannot link without custom flags or linker scripts.
CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT
---------------------------------------

Value used to initialize the :variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>`
cache entry the first time a build tree is configured.
This variable is meant to be set by a :variable:`toolchain file
<CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`.  CMake may prepend or append content to
the value based on the environment and target platform.

See also :variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT`.
CMAKE_HOST_UNIX
---------------

``True`` for UNIX and UNIX like operating systems.

Set to ``true`` when the host system is UNIX or UNIX like (i.e.  APPLE and
CYGWIN).
CMAKE_SUBLIME_TEXT_2_EXCLUDE_BUILD_TREE
---------------------------------------

If this variable evaluates to ``ON`` at the end of the top-level
``CMakeLists.txt`` file, the :generator:`Sublime Text 2` extra generator
excludes the build tree from the ``.sublime-project`` if it is inside the
source tree.
CPACK_SET_DESTDIR
-----------------

Boolean toggle to make CPack use ``DESTDIR`` mechanism when packaging.

``DESTDIR`` means DESTination DIRectory.  It is commonly used by makefile
users in order to install software at non-default location.  It is a
basic relocation mechanism that should not be used on Windows (see
:variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` documentation).  It is usually invoked like
this:

::

 make DESTDIR=/home/john install

which will install the concerned software using the installation
prefix, e.g. ``/usr/local`` prepended with the ``DESTDIR`` value which
finally gives ``/home/john/usr/local``.  When preparing a package, CPack
first installs the items to be packaged in a local (to the build tree)
directory by using the same ``DESTDIR`` mechanism.  Nevertheless, if
``CPACK_SET_DESTDIR`` is set then CPack will set ``DESTDIR`` before doing the
local install.  The most noticeable difference is that without
``CPACK_SET_DESTDIR``, CPack uses :variable:`CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX`
as a prefix whereas with ``CPACK_SET_DESTDIR`` set, CPack will use
:variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` as a prefix.

Manually setting ``CPACK_SET_DESTDIR`` may help (or simply be necessary)
if some install rules uses absolute ``DESTINATION`` (see CMake
:command:`install` command).  However, starting with CPack/CMake 2.8.3 RPM
and DEB installers tries to handle ``DESTDIR`` automatically so that it is
seldom necessary for the user to set it.
CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME
-----------------

The name of the operating system for which CMake is to build.
See the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION` variable for the OS version.

Note that ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` is not set to anything by default when running
in script mode, since it's not building anything.

System Name for Host Builds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` is by default set to the same value as the
:variable:`CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME` variable so that the build
targets the host system.

System Name for Cross Compiling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` may be set explicitly when first configuring a new build
tree in order to enable :ref:`cross compiling <Cross Compiling Toolchain>`.
In this case the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION` variable must also be
set explicitly.
CTEST_TEST_TIMEOUT
------------------

Specify the CTest ``TimeOut`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_FRAMEWORK_DIRECTORIES
------------------------------------------------

Implicit linker framework search path detected for language ``<LANG>``.

These paths are implicit linker framework search directories for the
compiler's language.  CMake automatically detects these directories
for each language and reports the results in this variable.
CTEST_CUSTOM_MAXIMUM_PASSED_TEST_OUTPUT_SIZE
--------------------------------------------

When saving a passing test's output, this is the maximum size, in bytes, that
will be collected by the :command:`ctest_test` command. Defaults to 1024
(1 KiB).

.. include:: CTEST_CUSTOM_XXX.txt
CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
---------------------------------------

Where to put all the :ref:`ARCHIVE <Archive Output Artifacts>`
target files when built for a specific configuration.

This variable is used to initialize the
:prop_tgt:`ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>` property on all the targets.
See that target property for additional information.
CMAKE_MATCH_COUNT
-----------------

The number of matches with the last regular expression.

When a regular expression match is used, CMake fills in
:variable:`CMAKE_MATCH_<n>` variables with the match contents.
The ``CMAKE_MATCH_COUNT`` variable holds the number of match
expressions when these are filled.
CMAKE_CTEST_COMMAND
-------------------

Full path to :manual:`ctest(1)` command installed with CMake.

This is the full path to the CTest executable :manual:`ctest(1)` which is
useful from custom commands that want to use the :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-E``
option for portable system commands.
CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX
----------------------------

Exclude the values of the :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` and
:variable:`CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX` variables from
:variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH`.  CMake adds these project-destination
prefixes to :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH` by default in order to
support building a series of dependent packages and installing them into
a common prefix.  Set ``CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX`` to ``TRUE``
to suppress this behavior.

The :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH` is initialized on the first call to a
:command:`project` or :command:`enable_language` command.  Therefore one must
set ``CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX`` before this in order to take effect.  A
user may set the variable as a cache entry on the command line to achieve this.

Note that the prefix(es) may still be searched for other reasons, such as being
the same prefix as the CMake installation, or for being a built-in system
prefix.
PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR
---------------------

Second version number component of the :variable:`PROJECT_VERSION`
variable as set by the :command:`project` command.
CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
-----------------------------------

Per-configuration output directory for MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` files
generated by the linker for executable and shared library targets.

This is a per-configuration version of :variable:`CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`.
This variable is used to initialize the
:prop_tgt:`PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`
property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
information.
CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
---------------------------

Flags for language ``<LANG>`` when building for the ``<CONFIG>`` configuration.
CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>
----------------------------------------

Variable for disabling :command:`find_package` calls.

Every non-``REQUIRED`` :command:`find_package` call in a project can be
disabled by setting the variable
``CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>`` to ``TRUE``.
This can be used to build a project without an optional package,
although that package is installed.

This switch should be used during the initial CMake run.  Otherwise if
the package has already been found in a previous CMake run, the
variables which have been stored in the cache will still be there.  In
that case it is recommended to remove the cache variables for this
package from the cache using the cache editor or :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-U``
CMAKE_CUDA_EXTENSIONS
---------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`CUDA_EXTENSIONS` property of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`CUDA_EXTENSIONS`
property on all targets.  See that target property for additional
information.

See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
CMAKE_ANDROID_STL_TYPE
----------------------

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android with NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual Studio
Edition`, this variable may be set to specify the default value for the
:prop_tgt:`ANDROID_STL_TYPE` target property.  See that target property
for additional information.

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android with the NDK`, this variable may be
set to specify the STL variant to be used.  The value may be one of:

``none``
  No C++ Support
``system``
  Minimal C++ without STL
``gabi++_static``
  GAbi++ Static
``gabi++_shared``
  GAbi++ Shared
``gnustl_static``
  GNU libstdc++ Static
``gnustl_shared``
  GNU libstdc++ Shared
``c++_static``
  LLVM libc++ Static
``c++_shared``
  LLVM libc++ Shared
``stlport_static``
  STLport Static
``stlport_shared``
  STLport Shared

The default value is ``gnustl_static``.  Note that this default differs from
the native NDK build system because CMake may be used to build projects for
Android that are not natively implemented for it and use the C++ standard
library.
CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY
--------------------------------

Disable the :command:`export(PACKAGE)` command.

In some cases, for example for packaging and for system wide
installations, it is not desirable to write the user package registry.
If the :variable:`CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY` variable is enabled,
the :command:`export(PACKAGE)` command will do nothing.

See also :ref:`Disabling the Package Registry`.
CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR
-------------------------

Automatically add the current source and build directories to the include path.

If this variable is enabled, CMake automatically adds
:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` and :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`
to the include path for each directory.  These additional include
directories do not propagate down to subdirectories.  This is useful
mainly for out-of-source builds, where files generated into the build
tree are included by files located in the source tree.

By default ``CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR`` is ``OFF``.
CTEST_CUSTOM_ERROR_POST_CONTEXT
-------------------------------

The number of lines to include as context which follow an error message by the
:command:`ctest_test` command. The default is 10.

.. include:: CTEST_CUSTOM_XXX.txt
MSVC60
------

Discouraged.  Use the :variable:`MSVC_VERSION` variable instead.

``True`` when using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0.

Set to ``true`` when the compiler is version 6.0 of Microsoft Visual C++.
CMAKE_<LANG>_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX
-------------------------------------

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android` this variable contains the absolute
path prefixing the toolchain GNU compiler and its binutils.

See also :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_SUFFIX`
and :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_MACHINE`.

For example, the path to the linker is::

  ${CMAKE_CXX_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX}ld${CMAKE_CXX_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_SUFFIX}
CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FLAG
-----------------------

Flag to be used to link a library into an executable.

The flag will be used to specify a library to link to an executable.
On most compilers this is ``-l``.
CMAKE_COMMAND
-------------

The full path to the :manual:`cmake(1)` executable.

This is the full path to the CMake executable :manual:`cmake(1)` which is
useful from custom commands that want to use the ``cmake -E`` option for
portable system commands.  (e.g.  ``/usr/local/bin/cmake``)
CTEST_CVS_UPDATE_OPTIONS
------------------------

Specify the CTest ``CVSUpdateOptions`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_TWEAK
----------------------------

Fourth version number component of the :variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION`
variable as set by the :command:`project` command.
PROJECT_BINARY_DIR
------------------

Full path to build directory for project.

This is the binary directory of the most recent :command:`project` command.
CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS
-------------------------

Linker flags to be used to create modules.

These flags will be used by the linker when creating a module.
CTEST_P4_OPTIONS
----------------

Specify the CTest ``P4Options`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_XCODE_PLATFORM_TOOLSET
----------------------------

Xcode compiler selection.

:generator:`Xcode` supports selection of a compiler from one of the installed
toolsets.  CMake provides the name of the chosen toolset in this
variable, if any is explicitly selected (e.g.  via the :manual:`cmake(1)`
``-T`` option).
CMAKE_AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS
----------------------------

Filter definitions used by :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOMOC`
to extract file names from source code as additional dependencies
for the ``moc`` file.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS`
property on all the targets. See that target property for additional
information.

By default it is empty.
CMAKE_<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET
------------------------------

Default value for the :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET` target
property when a target is created.
MSVC
----

Set to ``true`` when the compiler is some version of Microsoft Visual
C++ or another compiler simulating Visual C++.  Any compiler defining
``_MSC_VER`` is considered simulating Visual C++.

See also the :variable:`MSVC_VERSION` variable.
CMAKE_VS_SDK_EXCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
--------------------------------

This variable allows to override Visual Studio default Exclude Directories.
CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION_INTERNAL
--------------------------------------

An internal variable subject to change.

This is used to identify the variant of a compiler based on an internal
version number.  For some compilers this is needed to determine the
correct usage.
CMAKE_JOB_POOL_COMPILE
----------------------

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`JOB_POOL_COMPILE`
property on all the targets. See :prop_tgt:`JOB_POOL_COMPILE`
for additional information.
CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_PREFIX
--------------------------

The prefix for loadable modules that you link to.

The prefix to use for the name of a loadable module on this platform.

``CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_PREFIX_<LANG>`` overrides this for language ``<LANG>``.
CTEST_CUSTOM_ERROR_PRE_CONTEXT
------------------------------

The number of lines to include as context which precede an error message by
the :command:`ctest_test` command. The default is 10.

.. include:: CTEST_CUSTOM_XXX.txt
CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION
----------------------------------------

Visual Studio Windows Target Platform Version.

When targeting Windows 10 and above Visual Studio 2015 and above support
specification of a target Windows version to select a corresponding SDK.
The :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION` variable may be set to specify a
version.  Otherwise CMake computes a default version based on the Windows
SDK versions available.  The chosen Windows target version number is provided
in ``CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION``.  If no Windows 10 SDK
is available this value will be empty.

One may set a ``CMAKE_WINDOWS_KITS_10_DIR`` *environment variable*
to an absolute path to tell CMake to look for Windows 10 SDKs in
a custom location.  The specified directory is expected to contain
``Include/10.0.*`` directories.
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
------------------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying installation
*prefixes* to be searched by the :command:`find_package`,
:command:`find_program`, :command:`find_library`, :command:`find_file`, and
:command:`find_path` commands.  Each command will add appropriate
subdirectories (like ``bin``, ``lib``, or ``include``) as specified in its own
documentation.

By default this contains the standard directories for the current system, the
:variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`, and the :variable:`CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX`.
The installation and staging prefixes may be excluded by setting
the :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable.

``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH`` is *not* intended to be modified by the project;
use :variable:`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` for this.

See also :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH`,
:variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH`, :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH`,
and :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH`.
CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK_TOOLCHAIN_HOST_TAG
------------------------------------

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android with the NDK`, this variable
provides the NDK's "host tag" used to construct the path to prebuilt
toolchains that run on the host.
CTEST_CHECKOUT_COMMAND
----------------------

Tell the :command:`ctest_start` command how to checkout or initialize
the source directory in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_<LANG>_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY
----------------------------------

Rule variable to create a shared library.

This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to create a shared
library for the language ``<LANG>``.
CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL
--------------------------

The homepage URL of the top level project.

This variable holds the homepage URL of the project as specified in the top
level CMakeLists.txt file by a :command:`project` command.  In the event that
the top level CMakeLists.txt contains multiple :command:`project` calls,
the most recently called one from that top level CMakeLists.txt will determine
the value that ``CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL`` contains.  For example, consider
the following top level CMakeLists.txt:

.. code-block:: cmake

  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
  project(First HOMEPAGE_URL "http://first.example.com")
  project(Second HOMEPAGE_URL "http://second.example.com")
  add_subdirectory(sub)
  project(Third HOMEPAGE_URL "http://third.example.com")

And ``sub/CMakeLists.txt`` with the following contents:

.. code-block:: cmake

  project(SubProj HOMEPAGE_URL "http://subproj.example.com")
  message("CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL = ${CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL}")

The most recently seen :command:`project` command from the top level
CMakeLists.txt would be ``project(Second ...)``, so this will print::

  CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL = http://second.example.com

To obtain the homepage URL from the most recent call to :command:`project` in
the current directory scope or above, see the :variable:`PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL`
variable.
CMAKE_NOT_USING_CONFIG_FLAGS
----------------------------

Skip ``_BUILD_TYPE`` flags if true.

This is an internal flag used by the generators in CMake to tell CMake
to skip the ``_BUILD_TYPE`` flags.
CMAKE_DEBUG_TARGET_PROPERTIES
-----------------------------

Enables tracing output for target properties.

This variable can be populated with a list of properties to generate
debug output for when evaluating target properties.  Currently it can
only be used when evaluating the :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`,
:prop_tgt:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`, :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_OPTIONS`,
:prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC_OPTIONS`, :prop_tgt:`SOURCES`, :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_FEATURES`,
:prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` target properties and any other property
listed in :prop_tgt:`COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING` and other
``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_`` properties.  It outputs an origin for each entry in
the target property.  Default is unset.
UNIX
----

Set to ``True`` when the target system is UNIX or UNIX-like
(e.g. :variable:`APPLE` and :variable:`CYGWIN`).  The
:variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` variable should be queried if
a more specific understanding of the target system is required.
CTEST_CUSTOM_PRE_MEMCHECK
-------------------------

A list of commands to run at the start of the :command:`ctest_memcheck`
command.

.. include:: CTEST_CUSTOM_XXX.txt
CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
-------------------------------

Flags to be used when linking an executable.

Same as ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS_*`` but used by the linker when creating
executables.
CMAKE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_BEFORE
--------------------------------

Whether to append or prepend directories by default in
:command:`include_directories`.

This variable affects the default behavior of the :command:`include_directories`
command.  Setting this variable to ``ON`` is equivalent to using the ``BEFORE``
option in all uses of that command.
CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES
--------------------------------

List of files which have been installed using an ``ABSOLUTE DESTINATION`` path.

This variable is defined by CMake-generated ``cmake_install.cmake``
scripts.  It can be used (read-only) by programs or scripts that
source those install scripts.  This is used by some CPack generators
(e.g.  RPM).
CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
----------------------------------

Flags to be used when linking a module.

Same as ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS_*`` but used by the linker when creating modules.
CMAKE_<LANG>_ARCHIVE_FINISH
---------------------------

Rule variable to finish an existing static archive.

This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to finish a static
archive.  It is used in place of :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_CREATE_STATIC_LIBRARY`
on some platforms in order to support large object counts.  See also
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_ARCHIVE_CREATE` and
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_ARCHIVE_APPEND`.
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
------------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for the :command:`find_file` and :command:`find_path` commands.  By default it
is empty, it is intended to be set by the project.  See also
:variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH` and :variable:`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`.
CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH
----------------------

Do not include RPATHs in the build tree.

Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building
executables etc on systems that use RPATH.  When the software is
installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the
install RPATH.  If this variable is set to true then the software is
always built with no RPATH.
CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
---------------------------

The suffix for static libraries that you link to.

The suffix to use for the end of a static library filename, ``.lib`` on
Windows.

``CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_<LANG>`` overrides this for language ``<LANG>``.
PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL
--------------------

The homepage URL of the project.

This is the homepage URL given to the most recently called :command:`project`
command in the current directory scope or above.  To obtain the homepage URL
of the top level project, see the :variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL`
variable.
CPACK_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES
--------------------------------

List of files which have been installed using an ``ABSOLUTE DESTINATION`` path.

This variable is a Read-Only variable which is set internally by CPack
during installation and before packaging using
:variable:`CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES` defined in ``cmake_install.cmake``
scripts.  The value can be used within CPack project configuration
file and/or ``CPack<GEN>.cmake`` file of ``<GEN>`` generator.
CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK_TOOLCHAIN_VERSION
-----------------------------------

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android with the NDK`, this variable
may be set to specify the version of the toolchain to be used
as the compiler.  The variable must be set to one of these forms:

* ``<major>.<minor>``: GCC of specified version
* ``clang<major>.<minor>``: Clang of specified version
* ``clang``: Clang of most recent available version

A toolchain of the requested version will be selected automatically to
match the ABI named in the :variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH_ABI` variable.

If not specified, the default will be a value that selects the latest
available GCC toolchain.
CMAKE_CACHEFILE_DIR
-------------------

The directory with the ``CMakeCache.txt`` file.

This is the full path to the directory that has the ``CMakeCache.txt``
file in it.  This is the same as :variable:`CMAKE_BINARY_DIR`.
CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_TWEAK
---------------------------

The tweak version of the top level project.

This variable holds the tweak version of the project as specified in the top
level CMakeLists.txt file by a :command:`project` command. Please see
:variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION` documentation for the behavior when
multiple :command:`project` commands are used in the sources.
CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_LAUNCHER
------------------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` target property.
This variable is used to initialize the property on each target as it is
created.  This is done only when ``<LANG>`` is ``C``, ``CXX``, ``Fortran``,
or ``CUDA``.
CTEST_HG_UPDATE_OPTIONS
-----------------------

Specify the CTest ``HGUpdateOptions`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH
----------------

If true, do not add run time path information.

If this is set to ``TRUE``, then the rpath information is not added to
compiled executables.  The default is to add rpath information if the
platform supports it.  This allows for easy running from the build
tree.  To omit RPATH in the install step, but not the build step, use
:variable:`CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH` instead.
CMAKE_C_COMPILE_FEATURES
------------------------

List of features known to the C compiler

These features are known to be available for use with the C compiler. This
list is a subset of the features listed in the
:prop_gbl:`CMAKE_C_KNOWN_FEATURES` global property.

See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE
---------------------------------

Tell :command:`find_package` to warn if called without an explicit mode.

If :command:`find_package` is called without an explicit mode option
(``MODULE``, ``CONFIG``, or ``NO_MODULE``) and no ``Find<pkg>.cmake`` module
is in :variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` then CMake implicitly assumes that the
caller intends to search for a package configuration file.  If no package
configuration file is found then the wording of the failure message
must account for both the case that the package is really missing and
the case that the project has a bug and failed to provide the intended
Find module.  If instead the caller specifies an explicit mode option
then the failure message can be more specific.

Set ``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE`` to ``TRUE`` to tell
:command:`find_package` to warn when it implicitly assumes Config mode.  This
helps developers enforce use of an explicit mode in all calls to
:command:`find_package` within a project.
CMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN
-------------------------------

Default value for the :prop_tgt:`VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN` target
property when a target is created.
CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH
---------------------------------

Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.

``CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH`` is a boolean that if set to ``true``
will append directories in the linker search path and outside the
project to the :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_RPATH`.  This is used to initialize the
target property :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH` for all targets.
CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK_DEPRECATED_HEADERS
------------------------------------

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android with the NDK`, this variable
may be set to specify whether to use the deprecated per-api-level
headers instead of the unified headers.

If not specified, the default will be *false* if using a NDK version
that provides the unified headers and *true* otherwise.
CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE
----------------------

Full path to the CMake file that included the current one.

While processing a CMake file loaded by :command:`include` or
:command:`find_package` this variable contains the full path to the file
including it.  The top of the include stack is always the ``CMakeLists.txt``
for the current directory.  See also :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE`.
CMAKE_AUTORCC
-------------

Whether to handle ``rcc`` automatically for Qt targets.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC` property on all
the targets.  See that target property for additional information.
CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_MINSIZEREL
-----------------------------

This variable is the ``MinSizeRel`` variant of the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>` variable.
CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES
---------------------------

Suffixes to append when looking for libraries.

This specifies what suffixes to add to library names when the
:command:`find_library` command looks for libraries.  On Windows systems this
is typically ``.lib`` and ``.dll``, meaning that when trying to find the
``foo`` library it will look for ``foo.dll`` etc.
CMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX
---------------------

Maximum object file full-path length allowed by native build tools.

CMake computes for every source file an object file name that is
unique to the source file and deterministic with respect to the full
path to the source file.  This allows multiple source files in a
target to share the same name if they lie in different directories
without rebuilding when one is added or removed.  However, it can
produce long full paths in a few cases, so CMake shortens the path
using a hashing scheme when the full path to an object file exceeds a
limit.  CMake has a built-in limit for each platform that is
sufficient for common tools, but some native tools may have a lower
limit.  This variable may be set to specify the limit explicitly.  The
value must be an integer no less than 128.
CTEST_CONFIGURATION_TYPE
------------------------

Specify the CTest ``DefaultCTestConfigurationType`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE
--------------------------

Switch between strict and relaxed automoc mode.

By default, :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` behaves exactly as described in the
documentation of the :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` target property.  When set to
``TRUE``, it accepts more input and tries to find the correct input file for
``moc`` even if it differs from the documented behaviour.  In this mode it
e.g.  also checks whether a header file is intended to be processed by moc
when a ``"foo.moc"`` file has been included.

Relaxed mode has to be enabled for KDE4 compatibility.
CMAKE_VS_INCLUDE_PACKAGE_TO_DEFAULT_BUILD
-----------------------------------------

Include ``PACKAGE`` target to default build.

In Visual Studio solution, by default the ``PACKAGE`` target will not be part
of the default build. Setting this variable will enable the ``PACKAGE`` target
to be part of the default build.
CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER
---------------------

The full path to the compiler for ``LANG``.

This is the command that will be used as the ``<LANG>`` compiler.  Once
set, you can not change this variable.
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
-----------------

Global flag to cause :command:`add_library` to create shared libraries if on.

If present and true, this will cause all libraries to be built shared
unless the library was explicitly added as a static library.  This
variable is often added to projects as an :command:`option` so that each user
of a project can decide if they want to build the project using shared or
static libraries.
CTEST_BUILD_NAME
----------------

Specify the CTest ``BuildName`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_MATCH_<n>
---------------

Capture group ``<n>`` matched by the last regular expression, for groups
0 through 9.  Group 0 is the entire match.  Groups 1 through 9 are the
subexpressions captured by ``()`` syntax.

When a regular expression match is used, CMake fills in ``CMAKE_MATCH_<n>``
variables with the match contents.  The :variable:`CMAKE_MATCH_COUNT`
variable holds the number of match expressions when these are filled.
CMAKE_BUILD_RPATH
-----------------

A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` specifying runtime path (``RPATH``)
entries to add to binaries linked in the build tree (for platforms that
support it).  The entries will *not* be used for binaries in the install
tree.  See also the :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH` variable.

This is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`BUILD_RPATH` target property
for all targets.
APPLE
-----

Set to ``True`` when the target system is an Apple platform
(macOS, iOS, tvOS or watchOS).
CTEST_DROP_SITE_CDASH
---------------------

Specify the CTest ``IsCDash`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_VS_SDK_LIBRARY_WINRT_DIRECTORIES
--------------------------------------

This variable allows to override Visual Studio default Library WinRT
Directories.
CMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH_ABI
----------------------

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android`, this variable specifies the
target architecture and ABI to be used.  Valid values are:

* ``arm64-v8a``
* ``armeabi-v7a``
* ``armeabi-v6``
* ``armeabi``
* ``mips``
* ``mips64``
* ``x86``
* ``x86_64``

See also the :variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_ARM_MODE` and
:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_ARM_NEON` variables.
CTEST_DROP_METHOD
-----------------

Specify the CTest ``DropMethod`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS
------------------

Flags for all build types.

``<LANG>`` flags used regardless of the value of :variable:`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`.

This is initialized for each language from environment variables:

* ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS``:
  Initialized by the :envvar:`CFLAGS` environment variable.
* ``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS``:
  Initialized by the :envvar:`CXXFLAGS` environment variable.
* ``CMAKE_CUDA_FLAGS``:
  Initialized by the :envvar:`CUDAFLAGS` environment variable.
* ``CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS``:
  Initialized by the :envvar:`FFLAGS` environment variable.
CMAKE_MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>
----------------------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>` of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the
:prop_tgt:`MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>` property on all the targets.  See
that target property for additional information.
CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH
-----------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories to be *ignored* by
the :command:`find_program`, :command:`find_library`, :command:`find_file`,
and :command:`find_path` commands.  This is useful in cross-compiling
environments where some system directories contain incompatible but
possibly linkable libraries.  For example, on cross-compiled cluster
environments, this allows a user to ignore directories containing
libraries meant for the front-end machine.

By default this is empty; it is intended to be set by the project.
Note that ``CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH`` takes a list of directory names, *not*
a list of prefixes.  To ignore paths under prefixes (``bin``, ``include``,
``lib``, etc.), specify them explicitly.

See also the :variable:`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`, :variable:`CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH`,
:variable:`CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH`, and :variable:`CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH` variables.
CMAKE_CUDA_HOST_COMPILER
------------------------

Executable to use when compiling host code when compiling ``CUDA`` language
files. Maps to the nvcc -ccbin option.  Will only be used by CMake on the first
configuration to determine a valid host compiler for ``CUDA``. After a valid
host compiler has been found, this value is read-only.
CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED
----------------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED` property of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED`
property on all targets.  See that target property for additional
information.

See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME
----------------------

Name of the OS CMake is running on.

On systems that have the uname command, this variable is set to the
output of ``uname -s``.  ``Linux``, ``Windows``, and ``Darwin`` for OS X
are the values found on the big three operating systems.
CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR
----------------

The path to the top level of the source tree.

This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake source
tree.  For an in-source build, this would be the same as
:variable:`CMAKE_BINARY_DIR`.

When run in -P script mode, CMake sets the variables
:variable:`CMAKE_BINARY_DIR`, :variable:`CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`,
:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` and
:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` to the current working directory.
CMAKE_ANDROID_GUI
-----------------

Default value for the :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_GUI` target property of
executables.  See that target property for additional information.
CTEST_DROP_LOCATION
-------------------

Specify the CTest ``DropLocation`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
<PROJECT-NAME>_HOMEPAGE_URL
---------------------------

Value given to the ``HOMEPAGE_URL`` option of the most recent call to the
:command:`project` command with project name ``<PROJECT-NAME>``, if any.
CTEST_SCP_COMMAND
-----------------

Specify the CTest ``SCPCommand`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>
-------------------------------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>` of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>`
property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
information.
CTEST_CONFIGURE_COMMAND
-----------------------

Specify the CTest ``ConfigureCommand`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO
---------------------------------

This variable is the ``RelWithDebInfo`` variant of the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>` variable.
CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE
--------------------

This variable affects how ``find_*`` commands choose between
OS X Application Bundles and unix-style package components.

On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application Bundles, the
``CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE`` variable can be set to empty or
one of the following:

``FIRST``
  Try to find application bundles before standard programs.
  This is the default on Darwin.

``LAST``
  Try to find application bundles after standard programs.

``ONLY``
  Only try to find application bundles.

``NEVER``
  Never try to find application bundles.
CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
------------------------------

Where to put all the :ref:`ARCHIVE <Archive Output Artifacts>`
target files when built.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`
property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
information.
CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN
----------------------------------------

The external toolchain for cross-compiling, if supported.

Some compiler toolchains do not ship their own auxiliary utilities such as
archivers and linkers.  The compiler driver may support a command-line argument
to specify the location of such tools.
``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN`` may be set to a path to
the external toolchain and will be passed to the compiler driver if supported.

This variable may only be set in a toolchain file specified by
the :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` variable.
CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET
-----------------------

Native build system toolset specification provided by user.

Some CMake generators support a toolset specification to tell the
native build system how to choose a compiler.  If the user specifies
a toolset (e.g.  via the :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-T`` option) the value
will be available in this variable.

The value of this variable should never be modified by project code.
A toolchain file specified by the :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`
variable may initialize ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET``.  Once a given
build tree has been initialized with a particular value for this
variable, changing the value has undefined behavior.

Toolset specification is supported only on specific generators:

* :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above
* The :generator:`Xcode` generator for Xcode 3.0 and above

See native build system documentation for allowed toolset names.

Visual Studio Toolset Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` support toolset specification
using one of these forms:

* ``toolset``
* ``toolset[,key=value]*``
* ``key=value[,key=value]*``

The ``toolset`` specifies the toolset name.  The selected toolset name
is provided in the :variable:`CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET` variable.

The ``key=value`` pairs form a comma-separated list of options to
specify generator-specific details of the toolset selection.
Supported pairs are:

``cuda=<version>``
  Specify the CUDA toolkit version to use.  Supported by VS 2010
  and above with the CUDA toolkit VS integration installed.
  See the :variable:`CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_CUDA` variable.

``host=x64``
  Request use of the native ``x64`` toolchain on ``x64`` hosts.
  Supported by VS 2013 and above.
  See the :variable:`CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_HOST_ARCHITECTURE`
  variable.

``version=<version>``
  Specify the toolset version to use.  Supported by VS 2017
  and above with the specified toolset installed.
  See the :variable:`CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_VERSION` variable.
CMAKE_ECLIPSE_VERSION
---------------------

This cache variable is used by the Eclipse project generator.  See
:manual:`cmake-generators(7)`.

When using the Eclipse project generator, CMake tries to find the Eclipse
executable and detect the version of it. Depending on the version it finds,
some features are enabled or disabled. If CMake doesn't find
Eclipse, it assumes the oldest supported version, Eclipse Callisto (3.2).
CMAKE_EXTRA_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES
-----------------------------------

Additional suffixes for shared libraries.

Extensions for shared libraries other than that specified by
:variable:`CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX`, if any.  CMake uses this to recognize
external shared library files during analysis of libraries linked by a
target.
CMAKE_<LANG>_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE
---------------------------------

Target architecture library directory name detected for ``<LANG>``.

If the ``<LANG>`` compiler passes to the linker an architecture-specific
system library search directory such as ``<prefix>/lib/<arch>`` this
variable contains the ``<arch>`` name if/as detected by CMake.
CMAKE_<LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE
---------------------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE` target property.
This variable is used to initialize the property on each target as it is
created.  This is done only when ``<LANG>`` is ``C`` or ``CXX``.
CMAKE_<LANG>_STANDARD_LIBRARIES
-------------------------------

Libraries linked into every executable and shared library linked
for language ``<LANG>``.  This is meant for specification of system
libraries needed by the language for the current platform.

This variable should not be set by project code.  It is meant to be set by
CMake's platform information modules for the current toolchain, or by a
toolchain file when used with :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`.

See also :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`.
CMAKE_VS_NsightTegra_VERSION
----------------------------

When using a Visual Studio generator with the
:variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` variable set to ``Android``,
this variable contains the version number of the
installed NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual Studio Edition.
CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT
------------------------------

Value used to initialize the :variable:`CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS`
cache entry the first time a build tree is configured.
This variable is meant to be set by a :variable:`toolchain file
<CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`.  CMake may prepend or append content to
the value based on the environment and target platform.

See also the configuration-specific variable
:variable:`CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT`.
CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION
-------------------

Defined to ``0`` for compatibility with code written for older
CMake versions that may have defined higher values.

.. note::

  In CMake versions 2.8.2 through 2.8.12, this variable holds
  the fourth version number component of the
  :variable:`CMAKE_VERSION` variable.
CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT
---------------------------

Value used to initialize the :variable:`CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS`
cache entry the first time a build tree is configured.
This variable is meant to be set by a :variable:`toolchain file
<CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`.  CMake may prepend or append content to
the value based on the environment and target platform.

See also the configuration-specific variable
:variable:`CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT`.
CTEST_CUSTOM_ERROR_EXCEPTION
----------------------------

A list of regular expressions which will be used to exclude when detecting
error messages in build outputs by the :command:`ctest_test` command.

.. include:: CTEST_CUSTOM_XXX.txt
CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE_<LANG>
-------------------------------------

Specify a CMake file that overrides platform information for ``<LANG>``.

This is a language-specific version of
:variable:`CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE` loaded only when enabling language
``<LANG>``.
CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP<NNNN>
------------------------------

Explicitly enable or disable the warning when CMake Policy ``CMP<NNNN>``
is not set.  This is meaningful only for the few policies that do not
warn by default:

* ``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0025`` controls the warning for
  policy :policy:`CMP0025`.
* ``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0047`` controls the warning for
  policy :policy:`CMP0047`.
* ``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0056`` controls the warning for
  policy :policy:`CMP0056`.
* ``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0060`` controls the warning for
  policy :policy:`CMP0060`.
* ``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0065`` controls the warning for
  policy :policy:`CMP0065`.
* ``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0066`` controls the warning for
  policy :policy:`CMP0066`.
* ``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0067`` controls the warning for
  policy :policy:`CMP0067`.

This variable should not be set by a project in CMake code.  Project
developers running CMake may set this variable in their cache to
enable the warning (e.g. ``-DCMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP<NNNN>=ON``).
Alternatively, running :manual:`cmake(1)` with the ``--debug-output``,
``--trace``, or ``--trace-expand`` option will also enable the warning.
<PROJECT-NAME>_BINARY_DIR
-------------------------

Top level binary directory for the named project.

A variable is created with the name used in the :command:`project` command,
and is the binary directory for the project.  This can be useful when
:command:`add_subdirectory` is used to connect several projects.
CMAKE_CODEBLOCKS_COMPILER_ID
----------------------------

Change the compiler id in the generated CodeBlocks project files.

CodeBlocks uses its own compiler id string which differs from
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`.  If this variable is left empty,
CMake tries to recognize the CodeBlocks compiler id automatically.
Otherwise the specified string is used in the CodeBlocks project file.
See the CodeBlocks documentation for valid compiler id strings.

Other IDEs like QtCreator that also use the CodeBlocks generator may ignore
this setting.
CMAKE_<LANG>_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS
-----------------------------------

Extensions of source files for the given language.

This is the list of extensions for a given language's source files.
CTEST_CUSTOM_WARNING_MATCH
--------------------------

A list of regular expressions which will be used to detect warning messages in
build outputs by the :command:`ctest_test` command.

.. include:: CTEST_CUSTOM_XXX.txt
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE
--------------------------

Target architecture library directory name, if detected.

This is the value of :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE` as detected
for one of the enabled languages.
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
--------------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for OS X frameworks used by the :command:`find_library`,
:command:`find_package`, :command:`find_path`, and :command:`find_file`
commands.
CMAKE_SCRIPT_MODE_FILE
----------------------

Full path to the :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-P`` script file currently being
processed.

When run in :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-P`` script mode, CMake sets this variable to
the full path of the script file.  When run to configure a ``CMakeLists.txt``
file, this variable is not set.
CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
----------------------------------

Flags to be used when linking a shared library.

Same as ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS_*`` but used by the linker when creating shared
libraries.
LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH
-------------------

Old library location variable.

The target properties :prop_tgt:`ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`,
:prop_tgt:`LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`, and :prop_tgt:`RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`
supersede this variable for a target if they are set.  Library targets are
otherwise placed in this directory.
PROJECT_VERSION
---------------

Value given to the ``VERSION`` option of the most recent call to the
:command:`project` command, if any.

See also the component-wise version variables
:variable:`PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR`,
:variable:`PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR`,
:variable:`PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH`, and
:variable:`PROJECT_VERSION_TWEAK`.
CMAKE_XCODE_GENERATE_SCHEME
---------------------------

If enabled, the Xcode generator will generate schema files. Those are
are useful to invoke analyze, archive, build-for-testing and test
actions from the command line.

.. note::

  The Xcode Schema Generator is still experimental and subject to
  change.
CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME
------------------

The name of the top level project.

This variable holds the name of the project as specified in the top
level CMakeLists.txt file by a :command:`project` command.  In the event that
the top level CMakeLists.txt contains multiple :command:`project` calls,
the most recently called one from that top level CMakeLists.txt will determine
the name that ``CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME`` contains.  For example, consider
the following top level CMakeLists.txt:

.. code-block:: cmake

  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
  project(First)
  project(Second)
  add_subdirectory(sub)
  project(Third)

And ``sub/CMakeLists.txt`` with the following contents:

.. code-block:: cmake

  project(SubProj)
  message("CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME = ${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}")

The most recently seen :command:`project` command from the top level
CMakeLists.txt would be ``project(Second)``, so this will print::

  CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME = Second

To obtain the name from the most recent call to :command:`project` in
the current directory scope or above, see the :variable:`PROJECT_NAME`
variable.
CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
--------------------------

Output directory for MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` files generated by the
linker for executable and shared library targets.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`
property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional

CMAKE_ECLIPSE_MAKE_ARGUMENTS
----------------------------

This cache variable is used by the Eclipse project generator.  See
:manual:`cmake-generators(7)`.

This variable holds arguments which are used when Eclipse invokes the make
tool. By default it is initialized to hold flags to enable parallel builds
(using -j typically).
CMAKE_CODEBLOCKS_EXCLUDE_EXTERNAL_FILES
---------------------------------------

Change the way the CodeBlocks generator creates project files.

If this variable evaluates to ``ON`` the generator excludes from
the project file any files that are located outside the project root.
CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILE_OBJECT
---------------------------

Rule variable to compile a single object file.

This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to compile a single
object file for the language ``<LANG>``.
CTEST_RUN_CURRENT_SCRIPT
------------------------

Setting this to 0 prevents :manual:`ctest(1)` from being run again when it
reaches the end of a script run by calling ``ctest -S``.
CMAKE_HOST_WIN32
----------------

``True`` if the host system is running Windows, including Windows 64-bit and MSYS.

Set to ``false`` on Cygwin.
CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH
------------------------

Do not use the builtin ELF editor to fix RPATHs on installation.

When an ELF binary needs to have a different RPATH after installation
than it does in the build tree, CMake uses a builtin editor to change
the RPATH in the installed copy.  If this variable is set to true then
CMake will relink the binary before installation instead of using its
builtin editor.
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE
---------------------------------

.. |FIND_XXX| replace:: :command:`find_file` and :command:`find_path`

.. include:: CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_XXX.txt
CMAKE_C_STANDARD
----------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`C_STANDARD` property of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`C_STANDARD`

-------------------

See variable :variable:`CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX`.

This variable is a special case of the more-general
:variable:`CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX` variable for the `DEBUG` configuration.
ENV
---

Access environment variables.

Use the syntax ``$ENV{VAR}`` to read environment variable ``VAR``.  See also
the :command:`set` command to set ``ENV{VAR}``.
CTEST_GIT_UPDATE_CUSTOM
-----------------------

Specify the CTest ``GITUpdateCustom`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_ANDROID_PROCESS_MAX
-------------------------

Default value for the :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_PROCESS_MAX` target property.
See that target property for additional information.
CTEST_CURL_OPTIONS
------------------

Specify the CTest ``CurlOptions`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_RANLIB
------------

This specifies name of the program that randomizes libraries on UNIX,
not used on Windows, but may be present.
CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_RELEASE
--------------------------

This variable is the ``Release`` variant of the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>` variable.
CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES
-------------------------

Specifies the available build types on multi-config generators.

This specifies what build types (configurations) will be available
such as ``Debug``, ``Release``, ``RelWithDebInfo`` etc.  This has reasonable
defaults on most platforms, but can be extended to provide other build
types.  See also :variable:`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` for details of managing
configuration data, and :variable:`CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR`.
CTEST_GIT_COMMAND
-----------------

Specify the CTest ``GITCommand`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR
---------------------------------

Whether to use :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_NAME_DIR` on targets in the build tree.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR`
property on all targets.
CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX
--------------------

This variable may be set to a path to install to when cross-compiling. This can
be useful if the path in :variable:`CMAKE_SYSROOT` is read-only, or otherwise
should remain pristine.

The ``CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX`` location is also used as a search prefix by the
``find_*`` commands. This can be controlled by setting the
:variable:`CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable.

If any RPATH/RUNPATH entries passed to the linker contain the
``CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX``, the matching path fragments are replaced with the
:variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.
CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
---------------------------------------

Where to put all the :ref:`LIBRARY <Library Output Artifacts>`
target files when built for a specific configuration.

This variable is used to initialize the
:prop_tgt:`LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>` property on all the targets.
See that target property for additional information.
CMAKE_AUTOGEN_PARALLEL
----------------------

Number of parallel ``moc`` or ``uic`` processes to start when using
:prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_PARALLEL` property
on all the targets.  See that target property for additional information.

By default :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOGEN_PARALLEL` is unset.
CTEST_BZR_UPDATE_OPTIONS
------------------------

Specify the CTest ``BZRUpdateOptions`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_<LANG>_IGNORE_EXTENSIONS
------------------------------

File extensions that should be ignored by the build.

This is a list of file extensions that may be part of a project for a
given language but are not compiled.
CMAKE_<LANG>_SIZEOF_DATA_PTR
----------------------------

Size of pointer-to-data types for language ``<LANG>``.

This holds the size (in bytes) of pointer-to-data types in the target
platform ABI.  It is defined for languages ``C`` and ``CXX`` (C++).
CTEST_CVS_CHECKOUT
------------------

Deprecated.  Use :variable:`CTEST_CHECKOUT_COMMAND` instead.
CMAKE_PROJECT_<PROJECT-NAME>_INCLUDE
------------------------------------

A CMake language file or module to be included by the :command:`project`
command.  This is intended for injecting custom code into project
builds without modifying their source.
CMAKE_IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED
--------------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED` of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED`
property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
information.
<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_PATCH
----------------------------

Third version number component of the :variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION`
variable as set by the :command:`project` command.
CMAKE_SYSTEM
------------

Composite name of operating system CMake is compiling for.

This variable is the composite of :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` and
:variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION`, e.g.
``${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}-${CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION}``.  If
:variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION` is not set, then this variable is
the same as :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`.
CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES
-----------------------

Target specific architectures for OS X and iOS.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`OSX_ARCHITECTURES`
property on each target as it is created.  See that target property
for additional information.

.. include:: CMAKE_OSX_VARIABLE.txt
CMAKE_BINARY_DIR
----------------

The path to the top level of the build tree.

This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake build
tree.  For an in-source build, this would be the same as
:variable:`CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`.

When run in -P script mode, CMake sets the variables
:variable:`CMAKE_BINARY_DIR`, :variable:`CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`,
:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` and
:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` to the current working directory.
CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_PLATFORM_VARIABLES
------------------------------------

List of variables that the :command:`try_compile` command source file signature
must propagate into the test project in order to target the same platform as
the host project.

This variable should not be set by project code.  It is meant to be set by
CMake's platform information modules for the current toolchain, or by a
toolchain file when used with :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`.

Variables meaningful to CMake, such as :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`, are
propagated automatically.  The ``CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_PLATFORM_VARIABLES``
variable may be set to pass custom variables meaningful to a toolchain file.
For example, a toolchain file may contain:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME ...)
  set(CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_PLATFORM_VARIABLES MY_CUSTOM_VARIABLE)
  # ... use MY_CUSTOM_VARIABLE ...

If a user passes ``-DMY_CUSTOM_VARIABLE=SomeValue`` to CMake then this
setting will be made visible to the toolchain file both for the main
project and for test projects generated by the :command:`try_compile`
command source file signature.
CMAKE_VS_INCLUDE_INSTALL_TO_DEFAULT_BUILD
-----------------------------------------

Include ``INSTALL`` target to default build.

In Visual Studio solution, by default the ``INSTALL`` target will not be part
of the default build. Setting this variable will enable the ``INSTALL`` target
to be part of the default build.
CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_VERSION
---------------------------------

Visual Studio Platform Toolset version.

The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2017 and above allow to
select minor versions of the same toolset. The toolset version number
may be specified by a field in :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET` of
the form ``version=14.11``. If none is specified CMake will choose a default
toolset. The value may be empty if no minor version was selected and the
default is used.
CMAKE_NINJA_OUTPUT_PATH_PREFIX
------------------------------

Set output files path prefix for the :generator:`Ninja` generator.

Every output files listed in the generated ``build.ninja`` will be
prefixed by the contents of this variable (a trailing slash is
appended if missing).  This is useful when the generated ninja file is
meant to be embedded as a ``subninja`` file into a *super* ninja
project.  For example, a ninja build file generated with a command
like::

  cd top-build-dir/sub &&
  cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_NINJA_OUTPUT_PATH_PREFIX=sub/ path/to/source

can be embedded in ``top-build-dir/build.ninja`` with a directive like
this::

  subninja sub/build.ninja

The ``auto-regeneration`` rule in ``top-build-dir/build.ninja`` must have an
order-only dependency on ``sub/build.ninja``.

.. note::
  When ``CMAKE_NINJA_OUTPUT_PATH_PREFIX`` is set, the project generated
  by CMake cannot be used as a standalone project.  No default targets
  are specified.
CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_INIT
-----------------------

Value used to initialize the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` cache entry
the first time a build tree is configured for language ``<LANG>``.
This variable is meant to be set by a :variable:`toolchain file
<CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`.  CMake may prepend or append content to
the value based on the environment and target platform.

See also the configuration-specific
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT` variable.
CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR
----------------------

OS X directory name for installed targets.

``CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR`` is used to initialize the
:prop_tgt:`INSTALL_NAME_DIR` property on all targets.  See that target
property for more information.
CMAKE_NETRC_FILE
----------------

This variable is used to initialize the ``NETRC_FILE`` option for
:command:`file(DOWNLOAD)` and :command:`file(UPLOAD)` commands and the
module :module:`ExternalProject`. See those commands for additional
information.

The local option takes precedence over this variable.
CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX
----------------------

Default filename postfix for libraries under configuration ``<CONFIG>``.

When a non-executable target is created its :prop_tgt:`<CONFIG>_POSTFIX`
target property is initialized with the value of this variable if it is set.
CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNUCXX
------------------------

True if the C++ (``CXX``) compiler is GNU.
Use :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID <CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID>` instead.
CMAKE_<LANG>_SIMULATE_VERSION
-----------------------------

Version string of "simulated" compiler.

Some compilers simulate other compilers to serve as drop-in
replacements.  When CMake detects such a compiler it sets this
variable to what would have been the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION`
for the simulated compiler.
CTEST_CUSTOM_WARNING_EXCEPTION
------------------------------

A list of regular expressions which will be used to exclude when detecting
warning messages in build outputs by the :command:`ctest_test` command.

.. include:: CTEST_CUSTOM_XXX.txt
CMAKE_CACHE_PATCH_VERSION
-------------------------

Patch version of CMake used to create the ``CMakeCache.txt`` file

This stores the patch version of CMake used to write a CMake cache
file.  It is only different when a different version of CMake is run
on a previously created cache file.
CMAKE_ANDROID_ANT_ADDITIONAL_OPTIONS
------------------------------------

Default value for the :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_ANT_ADDITIONAL_OPTIONS` target property.
See that target property for additional information.
MSVC70
------

Discouraged.  Use the :variable:`MSVC_VERSION` variable instead.

``True`` when using Microsoft Visual C++ 7.0.

Set to ``true`` when the compiler is version 7.0 of Microsoft Visual C++.
CTEST_BZR_COMMAND
-----------------

Specify the CTest ``BZRCommand`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_INSTALL_MESSAGE
---------------------

Specify verbosity of installation script code generated by the
:command:`install` command (using the :command:`file(INSTALL)` command).
For paths that are newly installed or updated, installation
may print lines like::

  -- Installing: /some/destination/path

For paths that are already up to date, installation may print
lines like::

  -- Up-to-date: /some/destination/path

The ``CMAKE_INSTALL_MESSAGE`` variable may be set to control
which messages are printed:

``ALWAYS``
  Print both ``Installing`` and ``Up-to-date`` messages.

``LAZY``
  Print ``Installing`` but not ``Up-to-date`` messages.

``NEVER``
  Print neither ``Installing`` nor ``Up-to-date`` messages.

Other values have undefined behavior and may not be diagnosed.

If this variable is not set, the default behavior is ``ALWAYS``.
CMAKE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES
----------------------------

A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` list of macro names used by
:variable:`CMAKE_AUTOMOC` to determine if a C++ file needs to be
processed by ``moc``.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES`
property on all the targets. See that target property for additional
information.

The default value is ``Q_OBJECT;Q_GADGET;Q_NAMESPACE``.

Example
^^^^^^^
Let CMake know that source files that contain ``CUSTOM_MACRO`` must be ``moc``
processed as well::

  set(CMAKE_AUTOMOC ON)
  list(APPEND CMAKE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES "CUSTOM_MACRO")
CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
-------------------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the
:prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` property on all the targets.
See that target property for additional information.  If set, it's
value is also used by the :command:`try_compile` command.
CMAKE_<LANG>_GHS_KERNEL_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
--------------------------------------

GHS kernel flags for language ``<LANG>`` when building for the ``<CONFIG>``
configuration.
<PROJECT-NAME>_DESCRIPTION

CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH
---------------------------

Search path for OS X application bundles used by the :command:`find_program`,
and :command:`find_package` commands.  By default it contains the standard
directories for the current system.  It is *not* intended to be modified by
the project, use :variable:`CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH` for this.
CMAKE_ARGV0
-----------

Command line argument passed to CMake in script mode.

When run in :ref:`-P <CMake Options>` script mode, CMake sets this variable to
the first command line argument.  It then also sets ``CMAKE_ARGV1``,
``CMAKE_ARGV2``, ... and so on, up to the number of command line arguments
given.  See also :variable:`CMAKE_ARGC`.
CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE
--------------------------------------

Automatically add the current source and build directories to the
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` target property.

If this variable is enabled, CMake automatically adds for each shared
library target, static library target, module target and executable
target, :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` and
:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` to
the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` target property.  By default
``CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE`` is ``OFF``.
CTEST_P4_CLIENT
---------------

Specify the CTest ``P4Client`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG
------------------------

This variable is the ``Debug`` variant of the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>` variable.
CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNUG77
------------------------

True if the ``Fortran`` compiler is GNU.
Use :variable:`CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER_ID <CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID>` instead.
CMAKE_<LANG>_CREATE_STATIC_LIBRARY
----------------------------------

Rule variable to create a static library.

This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to create a static
library for the language ``<LANG>``.
CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER
-----------------------------

The default order for sorting packages found using :command:`find_package`.
It can assume one of the following values:

``NONE``
  Default.  No attempt is done to sort packages.
  The first valid package found will be selected.

``NAME``
  Sort packages lexicographically before selecting one.

``NATURAL``
  Sort packages using natural order (see ``strverscmp(3)`` manual),
  i.e. such that contiguous digits are compared as whole numbers.

Natural sorting can be employed to return the highest version when multiple
versions of the same library are found by :command:`find_package`.  For
example suppose that the following libraries have been found:

* libX-1.1.0
* libX-1.2.9
* libX-1.2.10

By setting ``NATURAL`` order we can select the one with the highest
version number ``libX-1.2.10``.

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER NATURAL)
  find_package(libX CONFIG)

The sort direction can be controlled using the
:variable:`CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_DIRECTION` variable
(by default decrescent, e.g. lib-B will be tested before lib-A).
CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT
---------------------------------------

Value used to initialize the :variable:`CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>`
cache entry the first time a build tree is configured.
This variable is meant to be set by a :variable:`toolchain file
<CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`.  CMake may prepend or append content to
the value based on the environment and target platform.

See also :variable:`CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT`.
CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
----------------------------------

Flags to be used when linking a static library.

Same as ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS_*`` but used by the linker when creating static
libraries.
CMAKE_ROOT
----------

Install directory for running cmake.

This is the install root for the running CMake and the ``Modules``
directory can be found here.  This is commonly used in this format:
``${CMAKE_ROOT}/Modules``
CTEST_CUSTOM_MEMCHECK_IGNORE
----------------------------

A list of regular expressions to use to exclude tests during the
:command:`ctest_memcheck` command.

.. include:: CTEST_CUSTOM_XXX.txt
WIN32
-----

Set to ``True`` when the target system is Windows, including Win64.
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
-----------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for CMake modules to be loaded by the :command:`include` or
:command:`find_package` commands before checking the default modules that come
with CMake.  By default it is empty, it is intended to be set by the project.
CTEST_COVERAGE_EXTRA_FLAGS
--------------------------

Specify the CTest ``CoverageExtraFlags`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH
-------------------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for the :command:`find_library` command.  By default this contains the
standard directories for the current system.  It is *not* intended to be
modified by the project; use :variable:`CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH` for this.
See also :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH`.
CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS
-------------------------------------------

Default permissions for directories created implicitly during installation
of files by :command:`install` and :command:`file(INSTALL)`.

If ``make install`` is invoked and directories are implicitly created they
get permissions set by :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS`
variable or platform specific default permissions if the variable is not set.

Implicitly created directories are created if they are not explicitly installed
by :command:`install` command but are needed to install a file on a certain
path. Example of such locations are directories created due to the setting of
:variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.

Expected content of the :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS`
variable is a list of permissions that can be used by :command:`install` command
`PERMISSIONS` section.

Example usage:

::

 set(CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS
      OWNER_READ
      OWNER_WRITE
      OWNER_EXECUTE
      GROUP_READ
    )
CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX
-----------------------

The suffix for executables on this platform.

The suffix to use for the end of an executable filename if any, ``.exe``
on Windows.

``CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX_<LANG>`` overrides this for language ``<LANG>``.
CMAKE_CL_64
-----------

Discouraged.  Use :variable:`CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P` instead.

Set to a true value when using a Microsoft Visual Studio ``cl`` compiler that
*targets* a 64-bit architecture.
CMAKE_CXX_COMPILE_FEATURES
--------------------------

List of features known to the C++ compiler

These features are known to be available for use with the C++ compiler. This
list is a subset of the features listed in the
:prop_gbl:`CMAKE_CXX_KNOWN_FEATURES` global property.

See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_MAJOR
----------------------------

First version number component of the :variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION`
variable as set by the :command:`project` command.
CMAKE_VS_INTEL_Fortran_PROJECT_VERSION
--------------------------------------

When generating for :generator:`Visual Studio 9 2008` or greater with the Intel
Fortran plugin installed, this specifies the ``.vfproj`` project file format
version.  This is intended for internal use by CMake and should not be
used by project code.
CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ABI
-------------------------

An internal variable subject to change.

This is used in determining the compiler ABI and is subject to change.
CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR
------------------------

The path to the binary directory currently being processed.

This the full path to the build directory that is currently being
processed by cmake.  Each directory added by :command:`add_subdirectory` will
create a binary directory in the build tree, and as it is being
processed this variable will be set.  For in-source builds this is the
current source directory being processed.

When run in -P script mode, CMake sets the variables
:variable:`CMAKE_BINARY_DIR`, :variable:`CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`,
:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` and
:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` to the current working directory.
CMAKE_ENABLE_EXPORTS
--------------------

Specify whether an executable exports symbols for loadable modules.

Normally an executable does not export any symbols because it is the
final program.  It is possible for an executable to export symbols to
be used by loadable modules.  When this property is set to true CMake
will allow other targets to ``link`` to the executable with the
:command:`TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES` command.  On all platforms a target-level
dependency on the executable is created for targets that link to it.
For DLL platforms an import library will be created for the exported
symbols and then used for linking.  All Windows-based systems
including Cygwin are DLL platforms.  For non-DLL platforms that
require all symbols to be resolved at link time, such as OS X, the
module will ``link`` to the executable using a flag like
``-bundle_loader``.  For other non-DLL platforms the link rule is simply
ignored since the dynamic loader will automatically bind symbols when
the module is loaded.

This variable is used to initialize the target property
:prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` for executable targets.
CMAKE_Swift_LANGUAGE_VERSION
----------------------------

Set to the Swift language version number.  If not set, the legacy "2.3"
version is assumed.
CMAKE_MACOSX_RPATH
-------------------

Whether to use rpaths on OS X and iOS.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`MACOSX_RPATH` property on
all targets.
CMAKE_ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN
----------------------------------

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android with a Standalone Toolchain`, this
variable holds the absolute path to the root directory of the toolchain.
The specified directory must contain a ``sysroot`` subdirectory.
CMAKE_SYSROOT_COMPILE
---------------------

Path to pass to the compiler in the ``--sysroot`` flag when compiling source
files.  This is the same as :variable:`CMAKE_SYSROOT` but is used only for
compiling sources and not linking.

This variable may only be set in a toolchain file specified by
the :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` variable.
CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR
-----------------------------

This variable is only used when :variable:`CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING` is on. It
should point to a command on the host system that can run executable built
for the target system.

The command will be used to run :command:`try_run` generated executables,
which avoids manual population of the TryRunResults.cmake file.

It is also used as the default value for the
:prop_tgt:`CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR` target property of executables.
CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX
---------------------------

The prefix for shared libraries that you link to.

The prefix to use for the name of a shared library, ``lib`` on UNIX.

``CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX_<LANG>`` overrides this for language ``<LANG>``.
CMAKE_ANDROID_PROGUARD
----------------------

Default value for the :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_PROGUARD` target property.
See that target property for additional information.
CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_TARGET
----------------------------

The target for cross-compiling, if supported.

Some compiler drivers are inherently cross-compilers, such as clang and
QNX qcc. These compiler drivers support a command-line argument to specify
the target to cross-compile for.

This variable may only be set in a toolchain file specified by
the :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` variable.
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX_INITIALIZED_TO_DEFAULT
-------------------------------------------

CMake sets this variable to a ``TRUE`` value when the
:variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` has just been initialized to
its default value, typically on the first run of CMake within
a new build tree.  This can be used by project code to change
the default without overriding a user-provided value:

.. code-block:: cmake

  if(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX_INITIALIZED_TO_DEFAULT)
    set(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX "/my/default" CACHE PATH "..." FORCE)
  endif()
CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS
----------------------

Linker flags to be used to create executables.

These flags will be used by the linker when creating an executable.
CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE
------------------------------

Preference value for linker language selection.

The "linker language" for executable, shared library, and module
targets is the language whose compiler will invoke the linker.  The
:prop_tgt:`LINKER_LANGUAGE` target property sets the language explicitly.
Otherwise, the linker language is that whose linker preference value
is highest among languages compiled and linked into the target.  See
also the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES` variable.
CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_AR
------------------------

A wrapper around ``ar`` adding the appropriate ``--plugin`` option for the
compiler.

See also :variable:`CMAKE_AR`.
CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY
----------------------

Specify the CTest ``SourceDirectory`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RULES
------------------------

Whether to disable generation of installation rules.

If ``TRUE``, cmake will neither generate installaton rules nor
will it generate ``cmake_install.cmake`` files. This variable is ``FALSE`` by
default.
CMAKE_SYSROOT_LINK
------------------

Path to pass to the compiler in the ``--sysroot`` flag when linking.  This is
the same as :variable:`CMAKE_SYSROOT` but is used only for linking and not
compiling sources.

This variable may only be set in a toolchain file specified by
the :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` variable.
EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH
----------------------

Old executable location variable.

The target property :prop_tgt:`RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` supercedes this
variable for a target if it is set.  Executable targets are otherwise placed in
this directory.
CMAKE_ERROR_DEPRECATED
----------------------

Whether to issue errors for deprecated functionality.

If ``TRUE``, use of deprecated functionality will issue fatal errors.
If this variable is not set, CMake behaves as if it were set to ``FALSE``.
CMAKE_NETRC
-----------

This variable is used to initialize the ``NETRC`` option for
:command:`file(DOWNLOAD)` and :command:`file(UPLOAD)` commands and the
module :module:`ExternalProject`. See those commands for additional
information.

The local option takes precedence over this variable.
CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES
-----------------------------------------

True if :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE` propagates across targets.

This is used when CMake selects a linker language for a target.
Languages compiled directly into the target are always considered.  A
language compiled into static libraries linked by the target is
considered if this variable is true.
CMAKE_DIRECTORY_LABELS
-----------------------

Specify labels for the current directory.

This is used to initialize the :prop_dir:`LABELS` directory property.
CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY
--------------------------------------

Skip :ref:`User Package Registry` in :command:`find_package` calls.

In some cases, for example to locate only system wide installations, it
is not desirable to use the :ref:`User Package Registry` when searching
for packages. If the :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`
variable is enabled, all the :command:`find_package` commands will skip
the :ref:`User Package Registry` as if they were called with the
``NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` argument.

See also :ref:`Disabling the Package Registry`.
CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT
------------------------------

Value used to initialize the :variable:`CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS`
cache entry the first time a build tree is configured.
This variable is meant to be set by a :variable:`toolchain file
<CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`.  CMake may prepend or append content to
the value based on the environment and target platform.

See also the configuration-specific variable
:variable:`CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT`.
CTEST_CUSTOM_ERROR_MATCH
------------------------

A list of regular expressions which will be used to detect error messages in
build outputs by the :command:`ctest_test` command.

.. include:: CTEST_CUSTOM_XXX.txt
CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH
---------------------------

The patch version of the top level project.

This variable holds the patch version of the project as specified in the top
level CMakeLists.txt file by a :command:`project` command. Please see
:variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION` documentation for the behavior when
multiple :command:`project` commands are used in the sources.
GHS-MULTI
---------

True when using Green Hills MULTI
CMAKE_ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DEPENDENCIES
-------------------------------------

Default value for the :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DEPENDENCIES` target
property.  See that target property for additional information.
CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX
---------------------------

The prefix for static libraries that you link to.

The prefix to use for the name of a static library, ``lib`` on UNIX.

``CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX_<LANG>`` overrides this for language ``<LANG>``.
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
----------------

Specifies the build type on single-configuration generators.

This statically specifies what build type (configuration) will be
built in this build tree.  Possible values are empty, ``Debug``, ``Release``,
``RelWithDebInfo``, ``MinSizeRel``, ...  This variable is only meaningful to
single-configuration generators (such as :ref:`Makefile Generators` and
:generator:`Ninja`) i.e.  those which choose a single configuration when CMake
runs to generate a build tree as opposed to multi-configuration generators
which offer selection of the build configuration within the generated build
environment.  There are many per-config properties and variables
(usually following clean ``SOME_VAR_<CONFIG>`` order conventions), such as
``CMAKE_C_FLAGS_<CONFIG>``, specified as uppercase:
``CMAKE_C_FLAGS_[DEBUG|RELEASE|RELWITHDEBINFO|MINSIZEREL|...]``.  For example,
in a build tree configured to build type ``Debug``, CMake will see to
having :variable:`CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG>` settings get
added to the :variable:`CMAKE_C_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>` settings.  See
also :variable:`CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES`.
CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE
-----------------------

Full path to the listfile currently being processed.

As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this variable will
always be set to the one currently being processed.  The value has
dynamic scope.  When CMake starts processing commands in a source file
it sets this variable to the location of the file.  When CMake
finishes processing commands from the file it restores the previous
value.  Therefore the value of the variable inside a macro or function
is the file invoking the bottom-most entry on the call stack, not the
file containing the macro or function definition.

See also :variable:`CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE`.
CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND
----------------------

Specify the CTest ``CoverageCommand`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.

Cobertura
'''''''''

Using `Cobertura`_ as the coverage generation within your multi-module
Java project can generate a series of XML files.

The Cobertura Coverage parser expects to read the coverage data from a
single XML file which contains the coverage data for all modules.
Cobertura has a program with the ability to merge given ``cobertura.ser`` files
and then another program to generate a combined XML file from the previous
merged file.  For command line testing, this can be done by hand prior to
CTest looking for the coverage files. For script builds,
set the ``CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND`` variable to point to a file which will
perform these same steps, such as a ``.sh`` or ``.bat`` file.

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND .../run-coverage-and-consolidate.sh)

where the ``run-coverage-and-consolidate.sh`` script is perhaps created by
the :command:`configure_file` command and might contain the following code:

.. code-block:: bash

  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  CoberturaFiles="$(find "/path/to/source" -name "cobertura.ser")"
  SourceDirs="$(find "/path/to/source" -name "java" -type d)"
  cobertura-merge --datafile coberturamerge.ser $CoberturaFiles
  cobertura-report --datafile coberturamerge.ser --destination . \
                   --format xml $SourceDirs

The script uses ``find`` to capture the paths to all of the ``cobertura.ser``
files found below the project's source directory.  It keeps the list of files
and supplies it as an argument to the ``cobertura-merge`` program. The
``--datafile`` argument signifies where the result of the merge will be kept.

The combined ``coberturamerge.ser`` file is then used to generate the XML report
using the ``cobertura-report`` program.  The call to the cobertura-report
program requires some named arguments.

``--datafila``
  path to the merged ``.ser`` file

``--destination``
  path to put the output files(s)

``--format``
  file format to write output in: xml or html

The rest of the supplied arguments consist of the full paths to the
``/src/main/java`` directories of each module within the source tree. These
directories are needed and should not be forgotten.

.. _`Cobertura`: http://cobertura.github.io/cobertura/
CMAKE_<LANG>_CPPLINT
--------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_CPPLINT` target property. This variable
is used to initialize the property on each target as it is created.  This
is done only when ``<LANG>`` is ``C`` or ``CXX``.
CMAKE_CACHE_MINOR_VERSION
-------------------------

Minor version of CMake used to create the ``CMakeCache.txt`` file

This stores the minor version of CMake used to write a CMake cache
file.  It is only different when a different version of CMake is run
on a previously created cache file.
CMAKE_<LANG>_OUTPUT_EXTENSION
-----------------------------

Extension for the output of a compile for a single file.

This is the extension for an object file for the given ``<LANG>``.  For
example ``.obj`` for C on Windows.
CTEST_CUSTOM_MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_ERRORS
-------------------------------------

The maximum number of errors in a single build step which will be detected.
After this, the :command:`ctest_test` command will truncate the output.
Defaults to 50.

.. include:: CTEST_CUSTOM_XXX.txt
CMAKE_VS_SDK_EXECUTABLE_DIRECTORIES
-----------------------------------

This variable allows to override Visual Studio default Executable Directories.
CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL
----------------

This variable exists only for backwards compatibility.
It contains the same value as :variable:`CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM`.
Use that variable instead.
CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS
-------------------------

Linker flags to be used to create static libraries.

These flags will be used by the linker when creating a static library.
CMAKE_ANDROID_PROGUARD_CONFIG_PATH
----------------------------------

Default value for the :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_PROGUARD_CONFIG_PATH` target property.
See that target property for additional information.
CMAKE_SYSROOT
-------------

Path to pass to the compiler in the ``--sysroot`` flag.

The ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` content is passed to the compiler in the ``--sysroot``
flag, if supported.  The path is also stripped from the RPATH/RUNPATH if
necessary on installation.  The ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` is also used to prefix
paths searched by the ``find_*`` commands.

This variable may only be set in a toolchain file specified by
the :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` variable.

See also the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSROOT_COMPILE` and
:variable:`CMAKE_SYSROOT_LINK` variables.
CMAKE_ANDROID_API
-----------------

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android with NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual Studio
Edition`, this variable may be set to specify the default value for the
:prop_tgt:`ANDROID_API` target property.  See that target property for
additional information.

Otherwise, when :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android`, this variable provides
the Android API version number targeted.  This will be the same value as
the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION` variable for ``Android`` platforms.
CMAKE_<LANG>_GHS_KERNEL_FLAGS_DEBUG
-----------------------------------

This variable is the ``Debug`` variant of the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_GHS_KERNEL_FLAGS_<CONFIG>` variable.
CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE
-------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`MACOSX_BUNDLE` of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`MACOSX_BUNDLE` property on
all the targets.  See that target property for additional information.
CMAKE_AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES
---------------------------------

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES`
property on all the targets. See that target property for additional
information.

By default it is ON.
CTEST_TEST_LOAD
---------------

Specify the ``TestLoad`` setting in the :ref:`CTest Test Step`
of a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.  This sets the
default value for the ``TEST_LOAD`` option of the :command:`ctest_test`
command.
CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES
---------------------------

Prefixes to prepend when looking for libraries.

This specifies what prefixes to add to library names when the
:command:`find_library` command looks for libraries.  On UNIX systems this is
typically ``lib``, meaning that when trying to find the ``foo`` library it
will look for ``libfoo``.
CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FILE_FLAG
----------------------------

Flag to be used to link a library specified by a path to its file.

The flag will be used before a library file path is given to the
linker.  This is needed only on very few platforms.
CTEST_SVN_COMMAND
-----------------

Specify the CTest ``SVNCommand`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_VS_SDK_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
--------------------------------

This variable allows to override Visual Studio default Include Directories.
MINGW
-----

``True`` when using MinGW

Set to ``true`` when the compiler is some version of MinGW.
CTEST_P4_UPDATE_OPTIONS
-----------------------

Specify the CTest ``P4UpdateOptions`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_C_STANDARD_REQUIRED
-------------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`C_STANDARD_REQUIRED` property of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`C_STANDARD_REQUIRED`
property on all targets.  See that target property for additional
information.

See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_RANLIB
----------------------------

A wrapper around ``ranlib`` adding the appropriate ``--plugin`` option for the
compiler.

See also :variable:`CMAKE_RANLIB`.
PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR
------------------

Top level source directory for the current project.

This is the source directory of the most recent :command:`project` command.
CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

The description of the top level project.

This variable holds the description of the project as specified in the top
level CMakeLists.txt file by a :command:`project` command.  In the event that
the top level CMakeLists.txt contains multiple :command:`project` calls,
the most recently called one from that top level CMakeLists.txt will determine
the value that ``CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION`` contains.  For example, consider
the following top level CMakeLists.txt:

.. code-block:: cmake

  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
  project(First DESCRIPTION "I am First")
  project(Second DESCRIPTION "I am Second")
  add_subdirectory(sub)
  project(Third DESCRIPTION "I am Third")

And ``sub/CMakeLists.txt`` with the following contents:

.. code-block:: cmake

  project(SubProj DESCRIPTION "I am SubProj")
  message("CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION = ${CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}")

The most recently seen :command:`project` command from the top level
CMakeLists.txt would be ``project(Second ...)``, so this will print::

  CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION = I am Second

To obtain the description from the most recent call to :command:`project` in
the current directory scope or above, see the :variable:`PROJECT_DESCRIPTION`
variable.
CMAKE_<LANG>_ARCHIVE_CREATE
---------------------------

Rule variable to create a new static archive.

This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to create a static
archive.  It is used in place of :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_CREATE_STATIC_LIBRARY`
on some platforms in order to support large object counts.  See also
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_ARCHIVE_APPEND` and
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_ARCHIVE_FINISH`.
CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED
---------------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED` property of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED`
property on all targets.  See that target property for additional
information.

See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
CMAKE_C_EXTENSIONS
------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`C_EXTENSIONS` property of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`C_EXTENSIONS`
property on all targets.  See that target property for additional
information.

See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
CTEST_CUSTOM_MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_WARNINGS
---------------------------------------

The maximum number of warnings in a single build step which will be detected.
After this, the :command:`ctest_test` command will truncate the output.
Defaults to 50.

.. include:: CTEST_CUSTOM_XXX.txt
CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION
-------------------------

The OS version CMake is running on.

A numeric version string for the system.  On systems that support
``uname``, this variable is set to the output of ``uname -r``. On other
systems this is set to major-minor version numbers.
CMAKE_AUTORCC_OPTIONS
---------------------

Additional options for ``rcc`` when using :variable:`CMAKE_AUTORCC`.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC_OPTIONS` property on
all the targets.  See that target property for additional information.

EXAMPLE
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cmake

  # ...
  set(CMAKE_AUTORCC_OPTIONS "--compress;9")
  # ...
CTEST_CHANGE_ID
---------------

Specify the CTest ``ChangeId`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.

This setting allows CTest to pass arbitrary information about this
build up to CDash.  One use of this feature is to allow CDash to
post comments on your pull request if anything goes wrong with your build.
CMAKE_<LANG>_GHS_KERNEL_FLAGS_RELEASE
-------------------------------------

This variable is the ``Release`` variant of the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_GHS_KERNEL_FLAGS_<CONFIG>` variable.
CMAKE_<LANG>_GHS_KERNEL_FLAGS_MINSIZEREL
----------------------------------------

This variable is the ``MinSizeRel`` variant of the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_GHS_KERNEL_FLAGS_<CONFIG>` variable.
CMAKE_CACHE_MAJOR_VERSION
-------------------------

Major version of CMake used to create the ``CMakeCache.txt`` file

This stores the major version of CMake used to write a CMake cache
file.  It is only different when a different version of CMake is run
on a previously created cache file.
CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_DIRECTION
---------------------------------

The sorting direction used by :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER`.
It can assume one of the following values:

``DEC``
  Default.  Ordering is done in descending mode.
  The highest folder found will be tested first.

``ASC``
  Ordering is done in ascending mode.
  The lowest folder found will be tested first.

If :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER` is not set or is set to ``NONE``
this variable has no effect.
CTEST_SVN_OPTIONS
-----------------

Specify the CTest ``SVNOptions`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION
--------------------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION` target property.

  ARMCC = ARM Compiler (arm.com)
  Bruce = Bruce C Compiler
  CCur = Concurrent Fortran (ccur.com)
  Clang = LLVM Clang (clang.llvm.org)
  Cray = Cray Compiler (cray.com)
  Embarcadero, Borland = Embarcadero (embarcadero.com)
  G95 = G95 Fortran (g95.org)
  GNU = GNU Compiler Collection (gcc.gnu.org)
  HP = Hewlett-Packard Compiler (hp.com)
  IAR = IAR Systems (iar.com)
  Intel = Intel Compiler (intel.com)
  MIPSpro = SGI MIPSpro (sgi.com)
  MSVC = Microsoft Visual Studio (microsoft.com)
  NVIDIA = NVIDIA CUDA Compiler (nvidia.com)
  OpenWatcom = Open Watcom (openwatcom.org)
  PGI = The Portland Group (pgroup.com)
  Flang = Flang Fortran Compiler
  PathScale = PathScale (pathscale.com)
  SDCC = Small Device C Compiler (sdcc.sourceforge.net)
  SunPro = Oracle Solaris Studio (oracle.com)
  TI = Texas Instruments (ti.com)
  TinyCC = Tiny C Compiler (tinycc.org)
  XL, VisualAge, zOS = IBM XL (ibm.com)

This variable is not guaranteed to be defined for all compilers or
languages.
CMAKE_VS_SDK_SOURCE_DIRECTORIES
-------------------------------

This variable allows to override Visual Studio default Source Directories.
CTEST_DROP_SITE
---------------

Specify the CTest ``DropSite`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS
-------------------------

Linker flags to be used to create shared libraries.

These flags will be used by the linker when creating a shared library.
CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG_INIT
-----------------------------

This variable is the ``Debug`` variant of the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT` variable.
CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM
------------------

Tool that can launch the native build system.
The value may be the full path to an executable or just the tool
name if it is expected to be in the ``PATH``.

The tool selected depends on the :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR` used
to configure the project:

* The :ref:`Makefile Generators` set this to ``make``, ``gmake``, or
  a generator-specific tool (e.g. ``nmake`` for :generator:`NMake Makefiles`).

  These generators store ``CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM`` in the CMake cache
  so that it may be edited by the user.

* The :generator:`Ninja` generator sets this to ``ninja``.

  This generator stores ``CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM`` in the CMake cache
  so that it may be edited by the user.

* The :generator:`Xcode` generator sets this to ``xcodebuild`` (or possibly an
  otherwise undocumented ``cmakexbuild`` wrapper implementing some
  workarounds).

  This generator prefers to lookup the build tool at build time
  rather than to store ``CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM`` in the CMake cache
  ahead of time.  This is because ``xcodebuild`` is easy to find,
  the ``cmakexbuild`` wrapper is needed only for older Xcode versions,
  and the path to ``cmakexbuild`` may be outdated if CMake itself moves.

  For compatibility with versions of CMake prior to 3.2, if
  a user or project explicitly adds ``CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM`` to
  the CMake cache then CMake will use the specified value.

* The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` set this to the full path to
  ``MSBuild.exe`` (VS >= 10), ``devenv.com`` (VS 7,8,9), or
  ``VCExpress.exe`` (VS Express 8,9).
  (See also variables
  :variable:`CMAKE_VS_MSBUILD_COMMAND` and
  :variable:`CMAKE_VS_DEVENV_COMMAND`.

  These generators prefer to lookup the build tool at build time
  rather than to store ``CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM`` in the CMake cache
  ahead of time.  This is because the tools are version-specific
  and can be located using the Windows Registry.  It is also
  necessary because the proper build tool may depend on the
  project content (e.g. the Intel Fortran plugin to VS 10 and 11
  requires ``devenv.com`` to build its ``.vfproj`` project files
  even though ``MSBuild.exe`` is normally preferred to support
  the :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`).

  For compatibility with versions of CMake prior to 3.0, if
  a user or project explicitly adds ``CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM`` to
  the CMake cache then CMake will use the specified value if
  possible.

* The :generator:`Green Hills MULTI` generator sets this to ``gbuild``.
  If a user or project explicitly adds ``CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM`` to
  the CMake cache then CMake will use the specified value.

The ``CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM`` variable is set for use by project code.
The value is also used by the :manual:`cmake(1)` ``--build`` and
:manual:`ctest(1)` ``--build-and-test`` tools to launch the native
build process.
ANDROID
-------

Set to ``1`` when the target system (:variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`) is
``Android``.
CMAKE_COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
----------------------------------

Output directory for MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` files
generated by the compiler while building source files.

This variable is used to initialize the
:prop_tgt:`COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` property on all the targets.
CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR
---------------------------

The minor version of the top level project.

This variable holds the minor version of the project as specified in the top
level CMakeLists.txt file by a :command:`project` command. Please see
:variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION` documentation for the behavior when
multiple :command:`project` commands are used in the sources.
CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD
------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`CXX_STANDARD` property of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`CXX_STANDARD`
property on all targets.  See that target property for additional
information.

See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND
-------------------------

Specify the CTest ``MemoryCheckCommand`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET
-------------------------

Visual Studio Platform Toolset name.

VS 10 and above use MSBuild under the hood and support multiple
compiler toolchains.  CMake may specify a toolset explicitly, such as
``v110`` for VS 11 or ``Windows7.1SDK`` for 64-bit support in VS 10
Express.  CMake provides the name of the chosen toolset in this
variable.

See the :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET` variable for details.
CMAKE_ANDROID_ASSETS_DIRECTORIES
--------------------------------

Default value for the :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_ASSETS_DIRECTORIES` target property.
See that target property for additional information.
CMAKE_SUPPRESS_REGENERATION
---------------------------

If CMAKE_SUPPRESS_REGENERATION is ``OFF``, which is default, then CMake adds a
special target on which all other targets depend that checks the build system
and optionally re-runs CMake to regenerate the build system when the target
specification source changes.

If this variable evaluates to ``ON`` at the end of the top-level
``CMakeLists.txt`` file, CMake will not add the regeneration target to the
build system or perform any build system checks.
CTEST_CUSTOM_COVERAGE_EXCLUDE
-----------------------------

A list of regular expressions which will be used to exclude files by their
path from coverage output by the :command:`ctest_coverage` command.

.. include:: CTEST_CUSTOM_XXX.txt
CMAKE_DEPENDS_IN_PROJECT_ONLY
-----------------------------

When set to ``TRUE`` in a directory, the build system produced by the
:ref:`Makefile Generators` is set up to only consider dependencies on source
files that appear either in the source or in the binary directories.  Changes
to source files outside of these directories will not cause rebuilds.

This should be used carefully in cases where some source files are picked up
through external headers during the build.
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH
-------------------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for the :command:`find_program` command.  By default this contains the
standard directories for the current system.  It is *not* intended to be
modified by the project; use :variable:`CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH` for this.
See also :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH`.
CMAKE_EDIT_COMMAND
------------------

Full path to :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` or :manual:`ccmake(1)`.  Defined only for
:ref:`Makefile Generators` when not using an "extra" generator for an IDE.

This is the full path to the CMake executable that can graphically
edit the cache.  For example, :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` or :manual:`ccmake(1)`.
CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT
------------------------------

Value used to initialize the :variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS`
cache entry the first time a build tree is configured.
This variable is meant to be set by a :variable:`toolchain file
<CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`.  CMake may prepend or append content to
the value based on the environment and target platform.

See also the configuration-specific variable
:variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT`.
XCODE
-----

``True`` when using :generator:`Xcode` generator.
CMAKE_ANDROID_JAR_DIRECTORIES
-----------------------------

Default value for the :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_JAR_DIRECTORIES` target property.
See that target property for additional information.
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
--------------------

Install directory used by :command:`install`.

If ``make install`` is invoked or ``INSTALL`` is built, this directory is
prepended onto all install directories.  This variable defaults to
``/usr/local`` on UNIX and ``c:/Program Files/${PROJECT_NAME}`` on Windows.
See :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX_INITIALIZED_TO_DEFAULT` for how a
project might choose its own default.

On UNIX one can use the ``DESTDIR`` mechanism in order to relocate the
whole installation. See :envvar:`DESTDIR` for more information.

The installation prefix is also added to :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH`
so that :command:`find_package`, :command:`find_program`,
:command:`find_library`, :command:`find_path`, and :command:`find_file`
will search the prefix for other software.

.. note::

  Use the :module:`GNUInstallDirs` module to provide GNU-style
  options for the layout of directories within the installation.
CTEST_TRIGGER_SITE
------------------

Specify the CTest ``TriggerSite`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR
----------------

Build-time reference to per-configuration output subdirectory.

For native build systems supporting multiple configurations in the
build tree (such as :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` and :generator:`Xcode`),
the value is a reference to a build-time variable specifying the name
of the per-configuration output subdirectory.  On :ref:`Makefile Generators`
this evaluates to `.` because there is only one configuration in a build tree.
Example values:

::

  $(ConfigurationName) = Visual Studio 9
  $(Configuration)     = Visual Studio 10
  $(CONFIGURATION)     = Xcode
  .                    = Make-based tools

Since these values are evaluated by the native build system, this
variable is suitable only for use in command lines that will be
evaluated at build time.  Example of intended usage:

::

  add_executable(mytool mytool.c)
  add_custom_command(
    OUTPUT out.txt
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool
            ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/in.txt out.txt
    DEPENDS mytool in.txt
    )
  add_custom_target(drive ALL DEPENDS out.txt)

Note that ``CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR`` is no longer necessary for this purpose but
has been left for compatibility with existing projects.  Instead
:command:`add_custom_command` recognizes executable target names in its
``COMMAND`` option, so
``${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool`` can be replaced
by just ``mytool``.

This variable is read-only.  Setting it is undefined behavior.  In
multi-configuration build systems the value of this variable is passed
as the value of preprocessor symbol ``CMAKE_INTDIR`` to the compilation
of all source files.
CMAKE_<LANG>_CLANG_TIDY
-----------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_CLANG_TIDY` target property
when ``<LANG>`` is ``C`` or ``CXX``.

This variable is used to initialize the property on each target as it is
created.  For example:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(CMAKE_CXX_CLANG_TIDY clang-tidy checks=-*,readability-*)
  add_executable(foo foo.cxx)
CYGWIN
------

``True`` for Cygwin.

Set to ``true`` when using Cygwin.
CTEST_GIT_INIT_SUBMODULES
-------------------------

Specify the CTest ``GITInitSubmodules`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
---------------------------------------

Where to put all the :ref:`RUNTIME <Runtime Output Artifacts>`
target files when built for a specific configuration.

This variable is used to initialize the
:prop_tgt:`RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>` property on all the targets.
See that target property for additional information.
CMAKE_AUTOUIC
-------------

Whether to handle ``uic`` automatically for Qt targets.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` property on all
the targets.  See that target property for additional information.
CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
---------------------------

The suffix for import libraries that you link to.

The suffix to use for the end of an import library filename if used on
this platform.

``CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_<LANG>`` overrides this for language ``<LANG>``.
CMAKE_Fortran_MODDIR_FLAG
-------------------------

Fortran flag for module output directory.

This stores the flag needed to pass the value of the
:prop_tgt:`Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY` target property to the compiler.
CPACK_INSTALL_SCRIPT
--------------------

Extra CMake script provided by the user.

If set this CMake script will be executed by CPack during its local
[CPack-private] installation which is done right before packaging the
files.  The script is not called by e.g.: ``make install``.
CMAKE_JOB_POOL_LINK
----------------------

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`JOB_POOL_LINK`
property on all the targets. See :prop_tgt:`JOB_POOL_LINK`
for additional information.
<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION
----------------------

Value given to the ``VERSION`` option of the most recent call to the
:command:`project` command with project name ``<PROJECT-NAME>``, if any.

See also the component-wise version variables
:variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_MAJOR`,
:variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_MINOR`,
:variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_PATCH`, and
:variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_TWEAK`.
CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD
-------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`CUDA_STANDARD` property of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`CUDA_STANDARD`
property on all targets.  See that target property for additional
information.

See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
CTEST_CUSTOM_TEST_IGNORE
------------------------

A list of regular expressions to use to exclude tests during the
:command:`ctest_test` command.

.. include:: CTEST_CUSTOM_XXX.txt
CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC
----------------------------

End a link line such that static system libraries are used.

Some linkers support switches such as ``-Bstatic`` and ``-Bdynamic`` to
determine whether to use static or shared libraries for ``-lXXX`` options.
CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link
directories for the platform.  By default CMake adds an option at the
end of the library list (if necessary) to set the linker search type
back to its starting type.  This property switches the final linker
search type to ``-Bstatic`` regardless of how it started.

This variable is used to initialize the target property
:prop_tgt:`LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC` for all targets. If set, it's
value is also used by the :command:`try_compile` command.

See also :variable:`CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC`.
CMAKE_WIN32_EXECUTABLE
----------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`WIN32_EXECUTABLE` of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`WIN32_EXECUTABLE` property
on all the targets.  See that target property for additional information.
<PROJECT-NAME>_SOURCE_DIR
-------------------------

Top level source directory for the named project.

A variable is created with the name used in the :command:`project` command,
and is the source directory for the project.  This can be useful when
:command:`add_subdirectory` is used to connect several projects.
CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR
---------------------

The extra generator used to build the project.  See
:manual:`cmake-generators(7)`.

When using the Eclipse, CodeBlocks, CodeLite, Kate or Sublime generators, CMake
generates Makefiles (:variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR`) and additionally project
files for the respective IDE.  This IDE project file generator is stored in
``CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR`` (e.g.  ``Eclipse CDT4``).
CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE
--------------------

Enables color output when using the :ref:`Makefile Generators`.

When enabled, the generated Makefiles will produce colored output.
Default is ``ON``.
MSVC90
------

Discouraged.  Use the :variable:`MSVC_VERSION` variable instead.

``True`` when using the Microsoft Visual Studio ``v90`` toolset
(``cl`` version 15) or another compiler that simulates it.
CMAKE_MSVCIDE_RUN_PATH
----------------------

Extra PATH locations that should be used when executing
:command:`add_custom_command` or :command:`add_custom_target` when using the
:generator:`Visual Studio 9 2008` (or above) generator. This allows
for running commands and using dll's that the IDE environment is not aware of.

If not set explicitly the value is initialized by the ``CMAKE_MSVCIDE_RUN_PATH``
environment variable, if set, and otherwise left empty.
CMAKE_<LANG>_PLATFORM_ID
------------------------

An internal variable subject to change.

This is used in determining the platform and is subject to change.
CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM
-----------------

Composite Name of OS CMake is being run on.

This variable is the composite of :variable:`CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME` and
:variable:`CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION`, e.g.
``${CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME}-${CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION}``.  If
:variable:`CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION` is not set, then this variable is
the same as :variable:`CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME`.
CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_SANITIZER_OPTIONS
-----------------------------------

Specify the CTest ``MemoryCheckSanitizerOptions`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_CUDA_TOOLKIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
--------------------------------------

When the ``CUDA`` language has been enabled, this provides a
:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of include directories provided
by the CUDA Toolkit.  The value may be useful for C++ source files
to include CUDA headers.
CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
------------------------------

Where to put all the :ref:`LIBRARY <Library Output Artifacts>`
target files when built.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`
property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
information.
CPACK_COMPONENT_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY
------------------------------------------

Boolean toggle to include/exclude top level directory (component case).

Similar usage as :variable:`CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY` but for the
component case.  See :variable:`CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY`
documentation for the detail.
MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION
--------------------

The toolset version of Microsoft Visual C/C++ being used if any.
If MSVC-like is being used, this variable is set based on the version
of the compiler as given by the :variable:`MSVC_VERSION` variable.

Known toolset version numbers are::

  80        = VS 2005 (8.0)
  90        = VS 2008 (9.0)
  100       = VS 2010 (10.0)
  110       = VS 2012 (11.0)
  120       = VS 2013 (12.0)
  140       = VS 2015 (14.0)
  141       = VS 2017 (15.0)

Compiler versions newer than those known to CMake will be reported
as the latest known toolset version.

See also the :variable:`MSVC_VERSION` variable.
CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR
----------------------

Full directory of the listfile currently being processed.

As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this variable will
always be set to the directory where the listfile which is currently
being processed (:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE`) is located.  The value
has dynamic scope.  When CMake starts processing commands in a source file
it sets this variable to the directory where this file is located.
When CMake finishes processing commands from the file it restores the
previous value.  Therefore the value of the variable inside a macro or
function is the directory of the file invoking the bottom-most entry
on the call stack, not the directory of the file containing the macro
or function definition.

See also :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE`.
CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
------------------------------

Fortran module output directory.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY`
property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
information.
CMAKE_GENERATOR
---------------

The generator used to build the project.  See :manual:`cmake-generators(7)`.

The name of the generator that is being used to generate the build
files.  (e.g.  ``Unix Makefiles``, ``Ninja``, etc.)
CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_PREFIX
---------------------------

The prefix for import libraries that you link to.

The prefix to use for the name of an import library if used on this
platform.

``CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_PREFIX_<LANG>`` overrides this for language ``<LANG>``.
CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
----------------------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION` of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION`
property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
information.
CMAKE_Fortran_MODOUT_FLAG
-------------------------

Fortran flag to enable module output.

Most Fortran compilers write ``.mod`` files out by default.  For others,
this stores the flag needed to enable module output.
CMAKE_ECLIPSE_GENERATE_SOURCE_PROJECT
-------------------------------------

This cache variable is used by the Eclipse project generator.  See
:manual:`cmake-generators(7)`.

If this variable is set to TRUE, the Eclipse project generator will generate
an Eclipse project in :variable:`CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR` . This project can then
be used in Eclipse e.g. for the version control functionality.
:variable:`CMAKE_ECLIPSE_GENERATE_SOURCE_PROJECT` defaults to FALSE; so
nothing is written into the source directory.
CMAKE_LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED
----------------------------

Whether to skip link dependencies on shared library files.

This variable initializes the :prop_tgt:`LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED` property on
targets when they are created.  See that target property for
additional information.
CPACK_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
-------------------------------------------

Ask CPack to error out as soon as a file with absolute ``INSTALL DESTINATION``
is encountered.

The fatal error is emitted before the installation of the offending
file takes place.  Some CPack generators, like NSIS, enforce this
internally.  This variable triggers the definition
of :variable:`CMAKE_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION` when CPack
runs.
CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR
---------------------------

The major version of the top level project.

This variable holds the major version of the project as specified in the top
level CMakeLists.txt file by a :command:`project` command. Please see
:variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION` documentation for the behavior when
multiple :command:`project` commands are used in the sources.
CMAKE_Fortran_MODDIR_DEFAULT
----------------------------

Fortran default module output directory.

Most Fortran compilers write ``.mod`` files to the current working
directory.  For those that do not, this is set to ``.`` and used when
the :prop_tgt:`Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY` target property is not set.
CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT
--------------------

Set to ``FIXED`` or ``FREE`` to indicate the Fortran source layout.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`Fortran_FORMAT` property on
all the targets.  See that target property for additional information.
CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE
--------------------

Path to toolchain file supplied to :manual:`cmake(1)`.

This variable is specified on the command line when cross-compiling with CMake.
It is the path to a file which is read early in the CMake run and which
specifies locations for compilers and toolchain utilities, and other target
platform and compiler related information.
XCODE_VERSION
-------------

Version of Xcode (:generator:`Xcode` generator only).

Under the Xcode generator, this is the version of Xcode as specified
in ``Xcode.app/Contents/version.plist`` (such as ``3.1.2``).
CMAKE_WARN_DEPRECATED
---------------------

Whether to issue warnings for deprecated functionality.

If not ``FALSE``, use of deprecated functionality will issue warnings.
If this variable is not set, CMake behaves as if it were set to ``TRUE``.

When running :manual:`cmake(1)`, this option can be enabled with the
``-Wdeprecated`` option, or disabled with the ``-Wno-deprecated`` option.
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR
----------------------

The name of the CPU CMake is building for.

This variable is the same as :variable:`CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR` if
you build for the host system instead of the target system when
cross compiling.

* The :generator:`Green Hills MULTI` generator sets this to ``ARM`` by default.
CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE
----------------------

Enable verbose output from Makefile builds.

This variable is a cache entry initialized (to ``FALSE``) by
the :command:`project` command.  Users may enable the option
in their local build tree to get more verbose output from
Makefile builds and show each command line as it is launched.
CMAKE_<LANG>_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_MACHINE
--------------------------------------

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android` this variable contains the
toolchain binutils machine name (e.g. ``gcc -dumpmachine``).  The
binutils typically have a ``<machine>-`` prefix on their name.

See also :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX`
and :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_SUFFIX`.
CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
-----------------------------------------

Directories implicitly searched by the compiler for header files.

CMake does not explicitly specify these directories on compiler
command lines for language ``<LANG>``.  This prevents system include
directories from being treated as user include directories on some
compilers.
CMAKE_GNUtoMS
-------------

Convert GNU import libraries (``.dll.a``) to MS format (``.lib``).

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`GNUtoMS` property on
targets when they are created.  See that target property for additional
information.
CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_PREDEFINES_COMMAND
----------------------------------------

Command that outputs the compiler pre definitions.

See :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` which uses
:variable:`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_PREDEFINES_COMMAND <CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_PREDEFINES_COMMAND>`
to generate the :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES`.
CMAKE_<LANG>_STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
-----------------------------------------

Include directories to be used for every source file compiled with
the ``<LANG>`` compiler.  This is meant for specification of system
include directories needed by the language for the current platform.
The directories always appear at the end of the include path passed
to the compiler.

This variable should not be set by project code.  It is meant to be set by
CMake's platform information modules for the current toolchain, or by a
toolchain file when used with :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`.

See also :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_STANDARD_LIBRARIES`.
CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
------------------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES` of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES`
property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
information.
CMAKE_XCODE_GENERATE_TOP_LEVEL_PROJECT_ONLY
-------------------------------------------

If enabled, the :generator:`Xcode` generator will generate only a
single Xcode project file for the topmost :command:`project()` command
instead of generating one for every ``project()`` command.

This could be useful to speed up the CMake generation step for
large projects and to work-around a bug in the ``ZERO_CHECK`` logic.
CMAKE_ANDROID_SKIP_ANT_STEP
---------------------------

Default value for the :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_SKIP_ANT_STEP` target property.
See that target property for additional information.
CTEST_CUSTOM_MAXIMUM_FAILED_TEST_OUTPUT_SIZE
--------------------------------------------

When saving a failing test's output, this is the maximum size, in bytes, that
will be collected by the :command:`ctest_test` command. Defaults to 307200
(300 KiB).

.. include:: CTEST_CUSTOM_XXX.txt
CMAKE_SUBLIME_TEXT_2_ENV_SETTINGS
---------------------------------

This variable contains a list of env vars as a list of tokens with the
syntax ``var=value``.

Example:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(CMAKE_SUBLIME_TEXT_2_ENV_SETTINGS
     "FOO=FOO1\;FOO2\;FOON"
     "BAR=BAR1\;BAR2\;BARN"
     "BAZ=BAZ1\;BAZ2\;BAZN"
     "FOOBAR=FOOBAR1\;FOOBAR2\;FOOBARN"
     "VALID="
     )

In case of malformed variables CMake will fail:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(CMAKE_SUBLIME_TEXT_2_ENV_SETTINGS
      "THIS_IS_NOT_VALID"
      )
PROJECT_NAME
------------

Name of the project given to the project command.

This is the name given to the most recently called :command:`project`
command in the current directory scope or above.  To obtain the name of
the top level project, see the :variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME` variable.
MSVC12
------

Discouraged.  Use the :variable:`MSVC_VERSION` variable instead.

``True`` when using the Microsoft Visual Studio ``v120`` toolset
(``cl`` version 18) or another compiler that simulates it.
CTEST_BUILD_COMMAND
-------------------

Specify the CTest ``MakeCommand`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH_FLAG
-----------------------

The flag to be used to add a library search path to a compiler.

The flag will be used to specify a library directory to the compiler.
On most compilers this is ``-L``.
CMAKE_<LANG>_CPPCHECK
---------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_CPPCHECK` target property. This variable
is used to initialize the property on each target as it is created.  This
is done only when ``<LANG>`` is ``C`` or ``CXX``.
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE_REGEX
--------------------------------

Regex matching possible target architecture library directory names.

This is used to detect :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE` from the
implicit linker search path by matching the ``<arch>`` name.
CPACK_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS
-------------------------------------------

Default permissions for implicitly created directories during packaging.

This variable serves the same purpose during packaging as the
:variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS` variable
serves during installation (e.g. ``make install``).

If `include(CPack)` is used then by default this variable is set to the content
of :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS`.
CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
-------------------------

The suffix for libraries that you link to.

The suffix to use for the end of a library filename, ``.lib`` on Windows.
CMAKE_PATCH_VERSION
-------------------

Third version number component of the :variable:`CMAKE_VERSION`
variable.
CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION
---------------------

The version of the top level project.

This variable holds the version of the project as specified in the top
level CMakeLists.txt file by a :command:`project` command.  In the event that
the top level CMakeLists.txt contains multiple :command:`project` calls,
the most recently called one from that top level CMakeLists.txt will determine
the value that ``CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION`` contains.  For example, consider
the following top level CMakeLists.txt:

.. code-block:: cmake

  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
  project(First VERSION 1.2.3)
  project(Second VERSION 3.4.5)
  add_subdirectory(sub)
  project(Third VERSION 6.7.8)

And ``sub/CMakeLists.txt`` with the following contents:

.. code-block:: cmake

  project(SubProj VERSION 1)
  message("CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION = ${CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION}")

The most recently seen :command:`project` command from the top level
CMakeLists.txt would be ``project(Second ...)``, so this will print::

  CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION = 3.4.5

To obtain the version from the most recent call to :command:`project` in
the current directory scope or above, see the :variable:`PROJECT_VERSION`
variable.
CMAKE_VS_MSBUILD_COMMAND
------------------------

The generators for :generator:`Visual Studio 10 2010` and above set this
variable to the ``MSBuild.exe`` command installed with the corresponding
Visual Studio version.

This variable is not defined by other generators even if ``MSBuild.exe``
is installed on the computer.

The :variable:`CMAKE_VS_DEVENV_COMMAND` is also provided for the
non-Express editions of Visual Studio.
See also the :variable:`CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM` variable.
CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY
---------------------------------------------

Skip :ref:`System Package Registry` in :command:`find_package` calls.

In some cases, it is not desirable to use the
:ref:`System Package Registry` when searching for packages. If the
:variable:`CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY` variable is
enabled, all the :command:`find_package` commands will skip
the :ref:`System Package Registry` as if they were called with the
``NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` argument.

See also :ref:`Disabling the Package Registry`.
CMAKE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS
---------------------

Additional options for ``uic`` when using :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOUIC`.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC_OPTIONS` property on
all the targets.  See that target property for additional information.

EXAMPLE
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cmake

  # ...
  set_property(CMAKE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS "--no-protection")
  # ...
CMAKE_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
-------------------------------------------

Ask ``cmake_install.cmake`` script to error out as soon as a file with
absolute ``INSTALL DESTINATION`` is encountered.

The fatal error is emitted before the installation of the offending
file takes place.  This variable is used by CMake-generated
``cmake_install.cmake`` scripts.  If one sets this variable to ``ON`` while
running the script, it may get fatal error messages from the script.
CTEST_DROP_SITE_PASSWORD
------------------------

Specify the CTest ``DropSitePassword`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX
------------------------------

The prefix used in the built package.

Each CPack generator has a default value (like ``/usr``).  This default
value may be overwritten from the ``CMakeLists.txt`` or the :manual:`cpack(1)`
command line by setting an alternative value.  Example:

::

  set(CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX "/opt")

This is not the same purpose as :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` which is used
when installing from the build tree without building a package.
MSVC_IDE
--------

``True`` when using the Microsoft Visual C++ IDE.

Set to ``true`` when the target platform is the Microsoft Visual C++ IDE, as
opposed to the command line compiler.
CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_LINE
-----------------------

The line number of the current file being processed.

This is the line number of the file currently being processed by
cmake.
CMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH
------------------

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android with NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual Studio
Edition`, this variable may be set to specify the default value for the
:prop_tgt:`ANDROID_ARCH` target property.  See that target property for
additional information.

Otherwise, when :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android`, this variable provides
the name of the Android architecture corresponding to the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH_ABI` variable.  The architecture name
may be one of:

* ``arm``
* ``arm64``
* ``mips``
* ``mips64``
* ``x86``
* ``x86_64``
MSVC71
------

Discouraged.  Use the :variable:`MSVC_VERSION` variable instead.

``True`` when using Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1.

Set to ``true`` when the compiler is version 7.1 of Microsoft Visual C++.
CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
------------------------------

Use the install path for the ``RPATH``.

Normally CMake uses the build tree for the ``RPATH`` when building
executables etc on systems that use ``RPATH``.  When the software is
installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the
install ``RPATH``.  If this variable is set to true then the software is
always built with the install path for the ``RPATH`` and does not need to
be relinked when installed.
CMAKE_COMPILER_2005
-------------------

Using the Visual Studio 2005 compiler from Microsoft

Set to true when using the Visual Studio 2005 compiler from Microsoft.
CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX
------------------------------------

Specify a ``<suffix>`` to tell the :command:`find_library` command to
search in a ``lib<suffix>`` directory before each ``lib`` directory that
would normally be searched.

This overrides the behavior of related global properties:

* :prop_gbl:`FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS`
* :prop_gbl:`FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS`
* :prop_gbl:`FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS`
CTEST_GIT_UPDATE_OPTIONS
------------------------

Specify the CTest ``GITUpdateOptions`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY
----------------------

Specify the CTest ``BuildDirectory`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET
---------------------------

Specify the minimum version of the target platform (e.g. macOS or iOS)
on which the target binaries are to be deployed.  CMake uses this
variable value for the ``-mmacosx-version-min`` flag or their respective
target platform equivalents.  For older Xcode versions that shipped
multiple macOS SDKs this variable also helps to choose the SDK in case
:variable:`CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT` is unset.

If not set explicitly the value is initialized by the
``MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`` environment variable, if set,
and otherwise computed based on the host platform.

.. include:: CMAKE_OSX_VARIABLE.txt
CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND_OPTIONS
---------------------------------

Specify the CTest ``MemoryCheckCommandOptions`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION
------------------------------

The ``<min>`` version of CMake given to the most recent call to the
:command:`cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)` command.
CMAKE_COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
-------------------------------------------

Per-configuration output directory for MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` files
generated by the compiler while building source files.

This is a per-configuration version of
:variable:`CMAKE_COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`.
This variable is used to initialize the
:prop_tgt:`COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`
property on all the targets.
CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
---------------------------

The suffix for shared libraries that you link to.

The suffix to use for the end of a shared library filename, ``.dll`` on
Windows.

``CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_<LANG>`` overrides this for language ``<LANG>``.
CMAKE_ANDROID_API_MIN
---------------------

Default value for the :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_API_MIN` target property.
See that target property for additional information.
CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an-attribute>
------------------------------------

Set Xcode target attributes directly.

Tell the :generator:`Xcode` generator to set '<an-attribute>' to a given value
in the generated Xcode project.  Ignored on other generators.

See the :prop_tgt:`XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an-attribute>` target property
to set attributes on a specific target.

Contents of ``CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an-attribute>`` may use
"generator expressions" with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the
:manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual for available
expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)` manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.
CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM
------------------------

Generator-specific target platform specification provided by user.

Some CMake generators support a target platform name to be given
to the native build system to choose a compiler toolchain.
If the user specifies a platform name (e.g. via the :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-A``
option) the value will be available in this variable.

The value of this variable should never be modified by project code.
A toolchain file specified by the :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`
variable may initialize ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM``.  Once a given
build tree has been initialized with a particular value for this
variable, changing the value has undefined behavior.

Platform specification is supported only on specific generators:

* For :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` with VS 2005 and above this
  specifies the target architecture.

See native build system documentation for allowed platform names.

Visual Studio Platform Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` the selected platform name
is provided in the :variable:`CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_NAME` variable.
CMAKE_AR
--------

Name of archiving tool for static libraries.

This specifies the name of the program that creates archive or static
libraries.
CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION
-------------------------------

Build configuration used for :command:`try_compile` and :command:`try_run`
projects.

Projects built by :command:`try_compile` and :command:`try_run` are built
synchronously during the CMake configuration step.  Therefore a specific build
configuration must be chosen even if the generated build system
supports multiple configurations.
PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR
---------------------

First version number component of the :variable:`PROJECT_VERSION`
variable as set by the :command:`project` command.
CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY
-----------------------------

Deprecated.  See CMake Policy :policy:`CMP0001` documentation.
CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME
-----------------------

Defined by the :command:`find_package` command while loading
a find module to record the caller-specified package name.
See command documentation for details.
CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNUCC
-----------------------

True if the ``C`` compiler is GNU.
Use :variable:`CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID <CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID>` instead.
<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_MINOR
----------------------------

Second version number component of the :variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION`
variable as set by the :command:`project` command.
CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
------------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for the :command:`find_library` command.  By default it is empty, it is
intended to be set by the project.  See also
:variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH` and :variable:`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`.
CMAKE_HOST_SOLARIS
------------------

``True`` for Oracle Solaris operating systems.

Set to ``true`` when the host system is Oracle Solaris.
CMAKE_<LANG>_ARCHIVE_APPEND
---------------------------

Rule variable to append to a static archive.

This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to append to a static
archive.  It is used in place of :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_CREATE_STATIC_LIBRARY`
on some platforms in order to support large object counts.  See also
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_ARCHIVE_CREATE` and
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_ARCHIVE_FINISH`.
CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY
--------------------

Path to top of source tree.

This is the path to the top level of the source tree.
CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES
------------------------------------

Implicit link libraries and flags detected for language ``<LANG>``.

Compilers typically pass language runtime library names and other
flags when they invoke a linker.  These flags are implicit link
options for the compiler's language.  CMake automatically detects
these libraries and flags for each language and reports the results in
this variable.
CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_MINSIZEREL_INIT
----------------------------------

This variable is the ``MinSizeRel`` variant of the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT` variable.
CMAKE_FOLDER
------------

Set the folder name. Use to organize targets in an IDE.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`FOLDER` property on all the
targets.  See that target property for additional information.
CMAKE_ANDROID_JAR_DEPENDENCIES
------------------------------

Default value for the :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_JAR_DEPENDENCIES` target property.
See that target property for additional information.
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH
--------------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of root paths to search on the filesystem.

This variable is most useful when cross-compiling. CMake uses the paths in
this list as alternative roots to find filesystem items with
:command:`find_package`, :command:`find_library` etc.
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM
---------------------------------

.. |FIND_XXX| replace:: :command:`find_program`

.. include:: CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_XXX.txt
CTEST_CUSTOM_POST_TEST
----------------------

A list of commands to run at the end of the :command:`ctest_test` command.

.. include:: CTEST_CUSTOM_XXX.txt
CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE
------------------------------

Specify a CMake file that overrides platform information.

CMake loads the specified file while enabling support for each
language from either the :command:`project` or :command:`enable_language`
commands.  It is loaded after CMake's builtin compiler and platform information
modules have been loaded but before the information is used.  The file
may set platform information variables to override CMake's defaults.

This feature is intended for use only in overriding information
variables that must be set before CMake builds its first test project
to check that the compiler for a language works.  It should not be
used to load a file in cases that a normal :command:`include` will work.  Use
it only as a last resort for behavior that cannot be achieved any
other way.  For example, one may set the
:variable:`CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_INIT>` variable
to change the default value used to initialize the
:variable:`CMAKE_C_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>` variable
before it is cached.  The override file should NOT be used to set anything
that could be set after languages are enabled, such as variables like
:variable:`CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` that affect the placement of
binaries.  Information set in the file will be used for :command:`try_compile`
and :command:`try_run` builds too.
CTEST_NIGHTLY_START_TIME
------------------------

Specify the CTest ``NightlyStartTime`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_VS_DEVENV_COMMAND
-----------------------

The generators for :generator:`Visual Studio 9 2008` and above set this
variable to the ``devenv.com`` command installed with the corresponding
Visual Studio version.  Note that this variable may be empty on
Visual Studio Express editions because they do not provide this tool.

This variable is not defined by other generators even if ``devenv.com``
is installed on the computer.

The :variable:`CMAKE_VS_MSBUILD_COMMAND` is also provided for
:generator:`Visual Studio 10 2010` and above.
See also the :variable:`CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM` variable.
CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT
-----------------

Specify the location or name of the OS X platform SDK to be used.
CMake uses this value to compute the value of the ``-isysroot`` flag
or equivalent and to help the ``find_*`` commands locate files in
the SDK.

If not set explicitly the value is initialized by the ``SDKROOT``
environment variable, if set, and otherwise computed based on the
:variable:`CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` or the host platform.

.. include:: CMAKE_OSX_VARIABLE.txt
CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES
--------------------------------------

Implicit linker search path detected for language ``<LANG>``.

Compilers typically pass directories containing language runtime
libraries and default library search paths when they invoke a linker.
These paths are implicit linker search directories for the compiler's
language.  CMake automatically detects these directories for each
language and reports the results in this variable.

Some toolchains read implicit directories from an environment variable such as
``LIBRARY_PATH``.  If using such an environment variable, keep its value
consistent when operating in a given build tree because CMake saves the value
detected when first creating a build tree.

If policy :policy:`CMP0060` is not set to ``NEW``, then when a library in one
of these directories is given by full path to :command:`target_link_libraries`
CMake will generate the ``-l<name>`` form on link lines for historical
purposes.
PROJECT_DESCRIPTION
-------------------

Short project description given to the project command.

This is the description given to the most recently called :command:`project`
command in the current directory scope or above.  To obtain the description
of the top level project, see the :variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION`
variable.
CMAKE_AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS
-------------------------

Additional options for ``moc`` when using :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOMOC`.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS` property
on all the targets.  See that target property for additional information.
CMAKE_<LANG>_CREATE_SHARED_MODULE
---------------------------------

Rule variable to create a shared module.

This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to create a shared
library for the language ``<LANG>``.
PROJECT_VERSION_TWEAK
---------------------

Fourth version number component of the :variable:`PROJECT_VERSION`
variable as set by the :command:`project` command.
CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ARCHITECTURE_ID
-------------------------------------

An internal variable subject to change.

This is used to identify the variant of a compiler based on its target
architecture.  For some compilers this is needed to determine the correct
usage.
CTEST_UPDATE_VERSION_ONLY
-------------------------

Specify the CTest ``UpdateVersionOnly`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY
--------------------------------

Boolean toggle to include/exclude top level directory.

When preparing a package CPack installs the item under the so-called
top level directory.  The purpose of is to include (set to ``1`` or ``ON`` or
``TRUE``) the top level directory in the package or not (set to ``0`` or
``OFF`` or ``FALSE``).

Each CPack generator has a built-in default value for this variable.
E.g.  Archive generators (ZIP, TGZ, ...) includes the top level
whereas RPM or DEB don't.  The user may override the default value by
setting this variable.

There is a similar variable
:variable:`CPACK_COMPONENT_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY` which may be used
to override the behavior for the component packaging
case which may have different default value for historical (now
backward compatibility) reason.
CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY
---------------------------------

Don't make the ``install`` target depend on the ``all`` target.

By default, the ``install`` target depends on the ``all`` target.  This
has the effect, that when ``make install`` is invoked or ``INSTALL`` is
built, first the ``all`` target is built, then the installation starts.
If :variable:`CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY` is set to ``TRUE``, this
dependency is not created, so the installation process will start immediately,
independent from whether the project has been completely built or not.
CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH
-------------------

The rpath to use for installed targets.

A semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed
targets (for platforms that support it).  This is used to initialize
the target property :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_RPATH` for all targets.
CMAKE_<LANG>_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_SUFFIX
-------------------------------------

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android` this variable contains the
host platform suffix of the toolchain GNU compiler and its binutils.

See also :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX`
and :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_MACHINE`.
CMAKE_LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE
---------------------------------

Default value for :prop_tgt:`LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE` target property.
This variable is used to initialize the property on each target as it is
created.
CTEST_DROP_SITE_USER
--------------------

Specify the CTest ``DropSiteUser`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_DL_LIBS
-------------

Name of library containing ``dlopen`` and ``dlclose``.

The name of the library that has ``dlopen`` and ``dlclose`` in it, usually
``-ldl`` on most UNIX machines.
CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH
--------------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for OS X application bundles used by the :command:`find_program`, and
:command:`find_package` commands.
CMAKE_ANDROID_ARM_MODE
----------------------

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android` and :variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH_ABI`
is set to one of the ``armeabi`` architectures, set ``CMAKE_ANDROID_ARM_MODE``
to ``ON`` to target 32-bit ARM processors (``-marm``).  Otherwise, the
default is to target the 16-bit Thumb processors (``-mthumb``).
CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK
--------------------

This variable affects how ``find_*`` commands choose between
OS X Frameworks and unix-style package components.

On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
``CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` variable can be set to empty or
one of the following:

``FIRST``
  Try to find frameworks before standard libraries or headers.
  This is the default on Darwin.

``LAST``
  Try to find frameworks after standard libraries or headers.

``ONLY``
  Only try to find frameworks.

``NEVER``
  Never try to find frameworks.
CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT
---------------------------------------

Value used to initialize the :variable:`CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>`
cache entry the first time a build tree is configured.
This variable is meant to be set by a :variable:`toolchain file
<CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`.  CMake may prepend or append content to
the value based on the environment and target platform.

See also :variable:`CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT`.
BORLAND
-------

``True`` if the Borland compiler is being used.

This is set to ``true`` if the Borland compiler is being used.
CTEST_SITE
----------

Specify the CTest ``Site`` setting
in a :manual:`ctest(1)` dashboard client script.
CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_COMPONENT_NAME
------------------------------------

Default component used in :command:`install` commands.

If an :command:`install` command is used without the ``COMPONENT`` argument,
these files will be grouped into a default component.  The name of this
default install component will be taken from this variable.  It
defaults to ``Unspecified``.
MSVC_VERSION
------------

The version of Microsoft Visual C/C++ being used if any.
If a compiler simulating Visual C++ is being used, this variable is set
to the toolset version simulated as given by the ``_MSC_VER``
preprocessor definition.

Known version numbers are::

  1200      = VS  6.0
  1300      = VS  7.0
  1310      = VS  7.1
  1400      = VS  8.0 (v80 toolset)
  1500      = VS  9.0 (v90 toolset)
  1600      = VS 10.0 (v100 toolset)
  1700      = VS 11.0 (v110 toolset)
  1800      = VS 12.0 (v120 toolset)
  1900      = VS 14.0 (v140 toolset)
  1910-1919 = VS 15.0 (v141 toolset)

See also the  :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION` and
:variable:`MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION` variable.
RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
------------------------

.. |XXX| replace:: :ref:`RUNTIME <Runtime Output Artifacts>`
.. |xxx| replace:: runtime
.. |CMAKE_XXX_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY| replace:: CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
.. include:: XXX_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY.txt

See also the :prop_tgt:`RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>` target property.
VS_GLOBAL_PROJECT_TYPES
-----------------------

Visual Studio project type(s).

Can be set to one or more UUIDs recognized by Visual Studio to
indicate the type of project.  This value is copied verbatim into the
generated project file.  Example for a managed C++ unit testing
project:

::

 {3AC096D0-A1C2-E12C-1390-A8335801FDAB};{8BC9CEB8-8B4A-11D0-8D11-00A0C91BC942}

UUIDs are semicolon-delimited.
VS_KEYWORD
----------

Visual Studio project keyword for VS 9 (2008) and older.

Can be set to change the visual studio keyword, for example Qt
integration works better if this is set to Qt4VSv1.0.

Use the :prop_tgt:`VS_GLOBAL_KEYWORD` target property to set the
keyword for Visual Studio 10 (2010) and newer.
BUNDLE
------

This target is a ``CFBundle`` on the OS X.

If a module library target has this property set to true it will be
built as a ``CFBundle`` when built on the mac.  It will have the directory
structure required for a ``CFBundle`` and will be suitable to be used for
creating Browser Plugins or other application resources.
WIN32_EXECUTABLE
----------------

Build an executable with a WinMain entry point on windows.

When this property is set to true the executable when linked on
Windows will be created with a WinMain() entry point instead of just
main().  This makes it a GUI executable instead of a console
application.  See the CMAKE_MFC_FLAG variable documentation to
configure use of MFC for WinMain executables.  This property is
initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_WIN32_EXECUTABLE if it
is set when a target is created.
INTERFACE_COMPILE_FEATURES
--------------------------

.. |property_name| replace:: compile features
.. |command_name| replace:: :command:`target_compile_features`
.. |PROPERTY_INTERFACE_NAME| replace:: ``INTERFACE_COMPILE_FEATURES``
.. |PROPERTY_LINK| replace:: :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_FEATURES`
.. |PROPERTY_GENEX| replace:: ``$<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,INTERFACE_COMPILE_FEATURES>``
.. include:: INTERFACE_BUILD_PROPERTY.txt

See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on compile
features and a list of supported compilers.
EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_<CONFIG>
-----------------------------------

Per-configuration version of target exclusion from "Build Solution".

This is the configuration-specific version of
EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD.  If the generic EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD
is also set on a target, EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_<CONFIG> takes
precedence in configurations for which it has a value.
<LANG>_CPPCHECK
---------------

This property is supported only when ``<LANG>`` is ``C`` or ``CXX``.

Specify a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` containing a command line
for the ``cppcheck`` static analysis tool.  The :ref:`Makefile Generators`
and the :generator:`Ninja` generator will run ``cppcheck`` along with the
compiler and report any problems.

This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_CPPCHECK` variable if it is set when a target is
created.
CUDA_EXTENSIONS
---------------

Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.

This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be
used.  For some compilers, this results in adding a flag such
as ``-std=gnu++11`` instead of ``-std=c++11`` to the compile line.  This
property is ``ON`` by default. The basic CUDA/C++ standard level is
controlled by the :prop_tgt:`CUDA_STANDARD` target property.

See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

This property is initialized by the value of
the :variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_EXTENSIONS` variable if it is set when a target
is created.
ANDROID_API_MIN
---------------

Set the Android MIN API version (e.g. ``9``).  The version number
must be a positive decimal integer.  This property is initialized by
the value of the :variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_API_MIN` variable if it is set
when a target is created.  Native code builds using this API version.
AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS
----------------------

Filter definitions used by :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` to extract file names from a
source file that are registered as additional dependencies for the
``moc`` file of the source file.

Filters are defined as ``KEYWORD;REGULAR_EXPRESSION`` pairs. First the file
content is searched for ``KEYWORD``. If it is found at least once, then file
names are extracted by successively searching for ``REGULAR_EXPRESSION`` and
taking the first match group.

The file name found in the first match group is searched for

- first in the vicinity of the source file
- and afterwards in the target's :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`.

If any of the extracted files changes, then the ``moc`` file for the source
file gets rebuilt even when the source file itself doesn't change.

If any of the extracted files is :prop_sf:`GENERATED` or if it is not in the
target's sources, then it might be necessary to add it to the
``_autogen`` target  dependencies.
See :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS` for reference.

By default :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS` is initialized from
:variable:`CMAKE_AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS`, which is empty by default.

See the :manual:`cmake-qt(7)` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.


Example 1
^^^^^^^^^

A header file ``my_class.hpp`` uses a custom macro ``JSON_FILE_MACRO`` which
is defined in an other header ``macros.hpp``.
We want the ``moc`` file of ``my_class.hpp`` to depend on the file name
argument of ``JSON_FILE_MACRO``::

  // my_class.hpp
  class My_Class : public QObject
  {
    Q_OBJECT
    JSON_FILE_MACRO ( "info.json" )
  ...
  };

In ``CMakeLists.txt`` we add a filter to
:variable:`CMAKE_AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS` like this::

  list( APPEND CMAKE_AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS
    "JSON_FILE_MACRO"
    "[\n][ \t]*JSON_FILE_MACRO[ \t]*\\([ \t]*\"([^\"]+)\""
  )

We assume ``info.json`` is a plain (not :prop_sf:`GENERATED`) file that is
listed in the target's source.  Therefore we do not need to add it to
:prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS`.

Example 2
^^^^^^^^^

In the target ``my_target`` a header file ``complex_class.hpp`` uses a
custom macro ``JSON_BASED_CLASS`` which is defined in an other header
``macros.hpp``::

  // macros.hpp
  ...
  #define JSON_BASED_CLASS(name, json) \
  class name : public QObject \
  { \
    Q_OBJECT \
    Q_PLUGIN_METADATA(IID "demo" FILE json) \
    name() {} \
  };
  ...

::

  // complex_class.hpp
  #pragma once
  JSON_BASED_CLASS(Complex_Class, "meta.json")
  // end of file

Since ``complex_class.hpp`` doesn't contain a ``Q_OBJECT`` macro it would be
ignored by :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC`.  We change this by adding ``JSON_BASED_CLASS``
to :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES`::

  list(APPEND CMAKE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES "JSON_BASED_CLASS")

We want the ``moc`` file of ``complex_class.hpp`` to depend on
``meta.json``.  So we add a filter to
:variable:`CMAKE_AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS`::

  list(APPEND CMAKE_AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS
    "JSON_BASED_CLASS"
    "[\n^][ \t]*JSON_BASED_CLASS[ \t]*\\([^,]*,[ \t]*\"([^\"]+)\""
  )

Additionally we assume ``meta.json`` is :prop_sf:`GENERATED` which is
why we have to add it to :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS`::

  set_property(TARGET my_target APPEND PROPERTY AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS "meta.json")
AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES
---------------------------

Boolean value used by :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` to determine if the
compiler pre definitions file ``moc_predefs.h`` should be generated.

CMake generates a ``moc_predefs.h`` file with compiler pre definitions
from the output of the command defined in
:variable:`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_PREDEFINES_COMMAND <CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_PREDEFINES_COMMAND>`
when

- :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` is enabled,
- :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES` is enabled,
- :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_PREDEFINES_COMMAND <CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_PREDEFINES_COMMAND>` isn't empty and
- the Qt version is greater or equal 5.8.

The ``moc_predefs.h`` file, which is generated in :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR`,
is passed to ``moc`` as the argument to the ``--include`` option.

By default :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES` is initialized from
:variable:`CMAKE_AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES`, which is ON by default.

See the :manual:`cmake-qt(7)` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
----------------------------

Enable interprocedural optimization for a target.

If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are
known to be supported by the compiler.

This property is initialized by the
:variable:`CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION` variable if it is set when a
target is created.
PRIVATE_HEADER
--------------

Specify private header files in a :prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK` shared library target.

Shared library targets marked with the :prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK` property generate
frameworks on OS X, iOS and normal shared libraries on other platforms.
This property may be set to a list of header files to be placed in the
PrivateHeaders directory inside the framework folder.  On non-Apple
platforms these headers may be installed using the ``PRIVATE_HEADER``
option to the ``install(TARGETS)`` command.
ANDROID_API
-----------

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android with NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual Studio
Edition`, this property sets the Android target API version (e.g. ``15``).
The version number must be a positive decimal integer.  This property is
initialized by the value of the :variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_API` variable if
it is set when a target is created.
INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
-----------------------------

.. |property_name| replace:: include directories
.. |command_name| replace:: :command:`target_include_directories`
.. |PROPERTY_INTERFACE_NAME| replace:: ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
.. |PROPERTY_LINK| replace:: :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`
.. |PROPERTY_GENEX| replace:: ``$<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>``
.. include:: INTERFACE_BUILD_PROPERTY.txt

Include directories usage requirements commonly differ between the build-tree
and the install-tree.  The ``BUILD_INTERFACE`` and ``INSTALL_INTERFACE``
generator expressions can be used to describe separate usage requirements
based on the usage location.  Relative paths are allowed within the
``INSTALL_INTERFACE`` expression and are interpreted relative to the
installation prefix.  For example:

.. code-block:: cmake

  target_include_directories(mylib INTERFACE
    $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/mylib>
    $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/mylib>  # <prefix>/include/mylib
  )

Creating Relocatable Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. |INTERFACE_PROPERTY_LINK| replace:: ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
.. include:: /include/INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_WARNING.txt
INSTALL_RPATH
-------------

The rpath to use for installed targets.

A semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed
targets (for platforms that support it).  This property is initialized
by the value of the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH if it is set when a
target is created.
INSTALL_NAME_DIR
----------------

Mac OSX directory name for installed targets.

INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a string specifying the directory portion of the
"install_name" field of shared libraries on Mac OSX to use in the
installed targets.

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
:variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR` if it is set when a target is
created.
VS_DEBUGGER_WORKING_DIRECTORY
-----------------------------

Sets the local debugger working directory for Visual Studio C++ targets.
This is defined in ``<LocalDebuggerWorkingDirectory>`` in the Visual Studio
project file.

This property only works for Visual Studio 2010 and above;
it is ignored on other generators.
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>
----------------------------

Ignored.  See CMake Policy :policy:`CMP0043`.

Per-configuration preprocessor definitions on a target.

This is the configuration-specific version of :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`
where ``<CONFIG>`` is an upper-case name (ex. ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG``).

Contents of ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
manual for available expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)`
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

Generator expressions should be preferred instead of setting this property.
RESOURCE
--------

Specify resource files in a :prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK` or :prop_tgt:`BUNDLE`.

Target marked with the :prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK` or :prop_tgt:`BUNDLE` property
generate framework or application bundle (both OS X and iOS is supported)
or normal shared libraries on other platforms.
This property may be set to a list of files to be placed in the corresponding
directory (eg. ``Resources`` directory for OS X) inside the bundle.
On non-Apple platforms these files may be installed using the ``RESOURCE``
option to the ``install(TARGETS)`` command.

Following example of Application Bundle:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_executable(ExecutableTarget
    addDemo.c
    resourcefile.txt
    appresourcedir/appres.txt
  )

  target_link_libraries(ExecutableTarget heymath mul)

  set(RESOURCE_FILES
    resourcefile.txt
    appresourcedir/appres.txt
  )

  set_target_properties(ExecutableTarget PROPERTIES
    MACOSX_BUNDLE TRUE
    MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER org.cmake.ExecutableTarget
    RESOURCE "${RESOURCE_FILES}"
  )

will produce flat structure for iOS systems::

  ExecutableTarget.app
    appres.txt
    ExecutableTarget
    Info.plist
    resourcefile.txt

For OS X systems it will produce following directory structure::

  ExecutableTarget.app/
    Contents
      Info.plist
      MacOS
        ExecutableTarget
      Resources
        appres.txt
        resourcefile.txt

For Linux, such cmake script produce following files::

  ExecutableTarget
  Resources
    appres.txt
    resourcefile.txt
IMPORTED_GLOBAL
---------------

Indication of whether an :ref:`IMPORTED target <Imported Targets>` is
globally visible.

The boolean value of this property is True for targets created with the
``IMPORTED`` ``GLOBAL`` options to :command:`add_executable()` or
:command:`add_library()`. It is always False for targets built within the
project.

For targets created with the ``IMPORTED`` option to
:command:`add_executable()` or :command:`add_library()` but without the
additional option ``GLOBAL`` this is False, too. However, setting this
property for such a locally ``IMPORTED`` target to True promotes that
target to global scope. This promotion can only be done in the same
directory where that ``IMPORTED`` target was created in the first place.

Once an imported target has been made global, it cannot be changed back to
non-global. Therefore, if a project sets this property, it may only
provide a value of True. CMake will issue an error if the project tries to
set the property to a non-True value, even if the value was already False.
CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED
----------------------

Boolean describing whether the value of :prop_tgt:`CUDA_STANDARD` is a requirement.

If this property is set to ``ON``, then the value of the
:prop_tgt:`CUDA_STANDARD` target property is treated as a requirement.  If this
property is ``OFF`` or unset, the :prop_tgt:`CUDA_STANDARD` target property is
treated as optional and may "decay" to a previous standard if the requested is
not available.  For compilers that have no notion of a standard level, such as
MSVC, this has no effect.

See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

This property is initialized by the value of
the :variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED` variable if it is set when a
target is created.
MANUALLY_ADDED_DEPENDENCIES
---------------------------

Get manually added dependencies to other top-level targets.

This read-only property can be used to query all dependencies that
were added for this target with the :command:`add_dependencies`
command.
AUTORCC_OPTIONS
---------------

Additional options for ``rcc`` when using :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC`

This property holds additional command line options which will be used
when ``rcc`` is executed during the build via :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC`,
i.e. it is equivalent to the optional ``OPTIONS`` argument of the
:module:`qt4_add_resources() <FindQt4>` macro.

By default it is empty.

This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_AUTORCC_OPTIONS` variable if it is set when a target is
created.

The options set on the target may be overridden by :prop_sf:`AUTORCC_OPTIONS`
set on the ``.qrc`` source file.

See the :manual:`cmake-qt(7)` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

EXAMPLE
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cmake

  # ...
  set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY AUTORCC_OPTIONS "--compress;9")
  # ...
RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
----------------

Specify a launcher for link rules.

See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global and directory property for a target.
RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME
-------------------

.. |XXX| replace:: :ref:`RUNTIME <Runtime Output Artifacts>`
.. |xxx| replace:: runtime
.. include:: XXX_OUTPUT_NAME.txt

See also the :prop_tgt:`RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>` target property.
INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
------------------------------------

List of public system include directories for a library.

Targets may populate this property to publish the include directories
which contain system headers, and therefore should not result in
compiler warnings.  The :command:`target_include_directories(SYSTEM)`
command signature populates this property with values given to the
``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` keywords.

Projects may also get and set the property directly, but must be aware that
adding directories to this property does not make those directories used
during compilation.  Adding directories to this property marks directories
as ``SYSTEM`` which otherwise would be used in a non-``SYSTEM`` manner.  This
can appear similar to 'duplication', so prefer the
high-level :command:`target_include_directories(SYSTEM)` command and avoid
setting the property by low-level means.

When target dependencies are specified using :command:`target_link_libraries`,
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to mark the
same include directories as containing system headers.

Contents of ``INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` may use "generator
expressions" with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the
:manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual for available expressions.
See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)` manual for more on defining
buildsystem properties.
COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
----------------------------

Output directory for the MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` file
generated by the compiler while building source files.

This property specifies the directory into which the MS debug symbols
will be placed by the compiler.  This property is initialized by the
value of the :variable:`CMAKE_COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` variable
if it is set when a target is created.

.. |PDB_XXX| replace:: :prop_tgt:`PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`
.. include:: COMPILE_PDB_NOTE.txt
LOCATION
--------

Read-only location of a target on disk.

For an imported target, this read-only property returns the value of
the LOCATION_<CONFIG> property for an unspecified configuration
<CONFIG> provided by the target.

For a non-imported target, this property is provided for compatibility
with CMake 2.4 and below.  It was meant to get the location of an
executable target's output file for use in add_custom_command.  The
path may contain a build-system-specific portion that is replaced at
build time with the configuration getting built (such as
"$(ConfigurationName)" in VS).  In CMake 2.6 and above
add_custom_command automatically recognizes a target name in its
COMMAND and DEPENDS options and computes the target location.  In
CMake 2.8.4 and above add_custom_command recognizes generator
expressions to refer to target locations anywhere in the command.
Therefore this property is not needed for creating custom commands.

Do not set properties that affect the location of a target after
reading this property.  These include properties whose names match
"(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_<CONFIG>)?",
``(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)``, or "LINKER_LANGUAGE".  Failure to follow
this rule is not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target
undefined.
AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES
-------------------

A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` list of macro names used by
:prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` to determine if a C++ file needs to be processed by ``moc``.

This property is only used if the :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` property is ``ON``
for this target.

When running :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC`, CMake searches for the strings listed in
:prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES` in C++ source and header files.
If any of the strings is found

- as the first non space string on a new line or
- as the first non space string after a ``{`` on a new line,

then the file will be processed by ``moc``.

By default :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES` is initialized from
:variable:`CMAKE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES`.

See the :manual:`cmake-qt(7)` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

Example
^^^^^^^

In this case the ``Q_OBJECT`` macro is hidden inside another macro
called ``CUSTOM_MACRO``.  To let CMake know that source files that contain
``CUSTOM_MACRO`` need to be ``moc`` processed, we call::

  set_property(TARGET tgt APPEND PROPERTY AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES "CUSTOM_MACRO")
PDB_NAME_<CONFIG>
-----------------

Per-configuration output name for the MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` file
generated by the linker for an executable or shared library target.

This is the configuration-specific version of :prop_tgt:`PDB_NAME`.

.. |COMPILE_PDB_XXX| replace:: :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_PDB_NAME_<CONFIG>`
.. include:: PDB_NOTE.txt
AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS
----------------------

Target dependencies of the corresponding ``_autogen`` target.

Targets which have their :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` or :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` property
``ON`` have a corresponding ``_autogen`` target which is used to auto generate
``moc`` and ``uic`` files.  As this ``_autogen`` target is created at
generate-time, it is not possible to define dependencies of it,
such as to create inputs for the ``moc`` or ``uic`` executable.

The :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS` target property can be set instead to a
list of dependencies of the ``_autogen`` target.  Dependencies can be target
names or file names.

See the :manual:`cmake-qt(7)` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

Use cases
^^^^^^^^^

If :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` or :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` depends on a file that is either

- a :prop_sf:`GENERATED` non C++ file (e.g. a :prop_sf:`GENERATED` ``.json``
  or ``.ui`` file) or
- a :prop_sf:`GENERATED` C++ file that isn't recognized by :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC`
  and :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` because it's skipped by :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOMOC`,
  :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOUIC`, :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOGEN` or :policy:`CMP0071` or
- a file that isn't in the target's sources

it must added to :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS`.
COMPILE_OPTIONS
---------------

List of options to pass to the compiler.

This property holds a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options
specified so far for its target.  Use the :command:`target_compile_options`
command to append more options.

This property is initialized by the :prop_dir:`COMPILE_OPTIONS` directory
property when a target is created, and is used by the generators to set
the options for the compiler.

Contents of ``COMPILE_OPTIONS`` may use "generator expressions" with the
syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual
for available expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)` manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.
JOB_POOL_LINK
-------------

Ninja only: Pool used for linking.

The number of parallel link processes could be limited by defining
pools with the global :prop_gbl:`JOB_POOLS`
property and then specifying here the pool name.

For instance:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set_property(TARGET myexe PROPERTY JOB_POOL_LINK two_jobs)

This property is initialized by the value of :variable:`CMAKE_JOB_POOL_LINK`.
PREFIX
------

What comes before the library name.

A target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as
"lib") on a library name.
OSX_ARCHITECTURES
-----------------

Target specific architectures for OS X.

The ``OSX_ARCHITECTURES`` property sets the target binary architecture for
targets on OS X (``-arch``).  This property is initialized by the value of the
variable :variable:`CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES` if it is set when a target is
created.  Use :prop_tgt:`OSX_ARCHITECTURES_<CONFIG>` to set the binary
architectures on a per-configuration basis, where ``<CONFIG>`` is an
upper-case name (e.g. ``OSX_ARCHITECTURES_DEBUG``).
IMPORTED_COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME
--------------------------------

Property to define if the target uses ``C++/CLI``.

Ignored for non-imported targets.

See also the :prop_tgt:`COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME` target property.
CXX_STANDARD
------------

The C++ standard whose features are requested to build this target.

This property specifies the C++ standard whose features are requested
to build this target.  For some compilers, this results in adding a
flag such as ``-std=gnu++11`` to the compile line.  For compilers that
have no notion of a standard level, such as Microsoft Visual C++ before
2015 Update 3, this has no effect.

Supported values are ``98``, ``11``, ``14``, ``17``, and ``20``.

If the value requested does not result in a compile flag being added for
the compiler in use, a previous standard flag will be added instead.  This
means that using:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 11)

with a compiler which does not support ``-std=gnu++11`` or an equivalent
flag will not result in an error or warning, but will instead add the
``-std=gnu++98`` flag if supported.  This "decay" behavior may be controlled
with the :prop_tgt:`CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED` target property.
Additionally, the :prop_tgt:`CXX_EXTENSIONS` target property may be used to
control whether compiler-specific extensions are enabled on a per-target basis.

See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

This property is initialized by the value of
the :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` variable if it is set when a target
is created.
VS_WINRT_EXTENSIONS
-------------------

Deprecated.  Use :prop_tgt:`VS_WINRT_COMPONENT` instead.
This property was an experimental partial implementation of that one.
CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION
--------------------------

CUDA only: Enables separate compilation of device code

If set this will enable separable compilation for all CUDA files for
the given target.

For instance:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set_property(TARGET myexe PROPERTY CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION ON)

This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION` variable if it is set when a
target is created.
<LANG>_CPPLINT
--------------

This property is supported only when ``<LANG>`` is ``C`` or ``CXX``.

Specify a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` containing a command line
for the ``cpplint`` style checker.  The :ref:`Makefile Generators` and the
:generator:`Ninja` generator will run ``cpplint`` along with the compiler
and report any problems.

This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_CPPLINT` variable if it is set when a target is
created.
VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_MIN_VERSION
--------------------------------------

Visual Studio Windows Target Platform Minimum Version

For Windows 10. Specifies the minimum version of the OS that is being
targeted. For example ``10.0.10240.0``. If the value is not specified, the
value of :variable:`CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION` will be used on
WindowsStore projects otherwise the target platform minimum version will not
be specified for the project.
ANDROID_GUI
-----------

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android with NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual Studio
Edition`, this property specifies whether to build an executable as an
application package on Android.

When this property is set to true the executable when built for Android
will be created as an application package.  This property is initialized
by the value of the :variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_GUI` variable if it is set
when a target is created.

Add the ``AndroidManifest.xml`` source file explicitly to the
target :command:`add_executable` command invocation to specify the
root directory of the application package source.
STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS
--------------------

Extra flags to use when linking static libraries.

Extra flags to use when linking a static library.
ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>
----------------------------

Per-configuration output name for
:ref:`ARCHIVE <Archive Output Artifacts>` target files.

This is the configuration-specific version of the
:prop_tgt:`ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME` target property.
INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH
---------------------------

Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.

INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true will
append directories in the linker search path and outside the project
to the INSTALL_RPATH.  This property is initialized by the value of
the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH if it is set when a
target is created.
IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES
---------------------------------

Languages compiled into an IMPORTED static library.

Set this to the list of languages of source files compiled to produce
a STATIC IMPORTED library (such as "C" or "CXX").  CMake accounts for
these languages when computing how to link a target to the imported
library.  For example, when a C executable links to an imported C++
static library CMake chooses the C++ linker to satisfy language
runtime dependencies of the static library.

This property is ignored for targets that are not STATIC libraries.
This property is ignored for non-imported targets.
VS_GLOBAL_KEYWORD
-----------------

Visual Studio project keyword for VS 10 (2010) and newer.

Sets the "keyword" attribute for a generated Visual Studio project.
Defaults to "Win32Proj".  You may wish to override this value with
"ManagedCProj", for example, in a Visual Studio managed C++ unit test
project.

Use the :prop_tgt:`VS_KEYWORD` target property to set the
keyword for Visual Studio 9 (2008) and older.
LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
---------------------------------

Per-configuration list of public interface libraries for a target.

This is the configuration-specific version of
:prop_tgt:`LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES`.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

This property is overridden by the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`
property if policy :policy:`CMP0022` is ``NEW``.

This property is deprecated.  Use :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`
instead.

Creating Relocatable Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. |INTERFACE_PROPERTY_LINK| replace:: ``LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>``
.. include:: /include/INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_WARNING.txt
IMPORT_PREFIX
-------------

What comes before the import library name.

Similar to the target property PREFIX, but used for import libraries
(typically corresponding to a DLL) instead of regular libraries.  A
target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as "lib")
on an import library name.
AUTOGEN_PARALLEL
----------------

Number of parallel ``moc`` or ``uic`` processes to start when using
:prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`.

The custom `<origin>_autogen` target starts a number of threads of which
each one parses a source file and on demand starts a ``moc`` or ``uic``
process.  :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_PARALLEL` controls how many parallel threads
(and therefore ``moc`` or ``uic`` processes) are started.

- An empty (or unset) value or the string ``AUTO`` sets the number of
  threads/processes to the number of physical CPUs on the host system.
- A positive non zero integer value sets the exact thread/process count.
- Otherwise a single thread/process is started.

By default :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_PARALLEL` is initialized from
:variable:`CMAKE_AUTOGEN_PARALLEL`.

See the :manual:`cmake-qt(7)` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
------------------------

.. |XXX| replace:: :ref:`LIBRARY <Library Output Artifacts>`
.. |xxx| replace:: library
.. |CMAKE_XXX_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY| replace:: CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
.. include:: XXX_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY.txt

See also the :prop_tgt:`LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>` target property.
INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>
-------------------------------------

Per-configuration interprocedural optimization for a target.

This is a per-configuration version of INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION.
If set, this property overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.

This property is initialized by the
:variable:`CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>` variable if it is set
when a target is created.
ANDROID_JAR_DEPENDENCIES
------------------------

Set the Android property that specifies JAR dependencies.
This is a string value property. This property is initialized
by the value of the :variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_JAR_DEPENDENCIES`
variable if it is set when a target is created.
<LANG>_CLANG_TIDY
-----------------

This property is implemented only when ``<LANG>`` is ``C`` or ``CXX``.

Specify a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` containing a command
line for the ``clang-tidy`` tool.  The :ref:`Makefile Generators`
and the :generator:`Ninja` generator will run this tool along with the
compiler and report a warning if the tool reports any problems.

This property is initialized by the value of
the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_CLANG_TIDY` variable if it is set
when a target is created.
IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS
-----------------------

Configurations provided for an IMPORTED target.

Set this to the list of configuration names available for an IMPORTED
target.  The names correspond to configurations defined in the project
from which the target is imported.  If the importing project uses a
different set of configurations the names may be mapped using the
MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG> property.  Ignored for non-imported
targets.
BUILD_RPATH
-----------

A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` specifying runtime path (``RPATH``)
entries to add to binaries linked in the build tree (for platforms that
support it).  The entries will *not* be used for binaries in the install
tree.  See also the :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_RPATH` target property.

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
:variable:`CMAKE_BUILD_RPATH` if it is set when a target is created.
LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
------------------------

List public interface libraries for a shared library or executable.

By default linking to a shared library target transitively links to
targets with which the library itself was linked.  For an executable
with exports (see the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property) no
default transitive link dependencies are used.  This property replaces the default
transitive link dependencies with an explicit list.  When the target
is linked into another target using the :command:`target_link_libraries`
command, the libraries listed (and recursively
their link interface libraries) will be provided to the other target
also.  If the list is empty then no transitive link dependencies will
be incorporated when this target is linked into another target even if
the default set is non-empty.  This property is initialized by the
value of the :variable:`CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES` variable if it is
set when a target is created.  This property is ignored for ``STATIC``
libraries.

This property is overridden by the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`
property if policy :policy:`CMP0022` is ``NEW``.

This property is deprecated.  Use :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`
instead.

Creating Relocatable Packages

.. |PROPERTY_GENEX| replace:: ``$<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS>``
.. include:: INTERFACE_BUILD_PROPERTY.txt
VS_WINRT_COMPONENT
------------------

Mark a target as a Windows Runtime component for the Visual Studio generator.
Compile the target with ``C++/CX`` language extensions for Windows Runtime.
For ``SHARED`` and ``MODULE`` libraries, this also defines the
``_WINRT_DLL`` preprocessor macro.

.. note::
  Currently this is implemented only by Visual Studio generators.
  Support may be added to other generators in the future.
PROJECT_LABEL
-------------

Change the name of a target in an IDE.

Can be used to change the name of the target in an IDE like Visual
Studio.
XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an-attribute>
------------------------------

Set Xcode target attributes directly.

Tell the Xcode generator to set '<an-attribute>' to a given value in
the generated Xcode project.  Ignored on other generators.

See the :variable:`CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an-attribute>` variable
to set attributes on all targets in a directory tree.

Contents of ``XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an-attribute>`` may use
"generator expressions" with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the
:manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual for available
expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)` manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.
IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
------------------------------------------

<CONFIG>-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES.

Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.
ANDROID_ANT_ADDITIONAL_OPTIONS
------------------------------

Set the additional options for Android Ant build system. This is
a string value containing all command line options for the Ant build.
This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_ANT_ADDITIONAL_OPTIONS` variable if it is
set when a target is created.
VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES
--------------------

Visual Studio managed project .NET references

Adds one or more semicolon-delimited .NET references to a generated
Visual Studio project.  For example, "System;System.Windows.Forms".
ANDROID_PROGUARD
----------------

When this property is set to true that enables the ProGuard tool to shrink,
optimize, and obfuscate the code by removing unused code and renaming
classes, fields, and methods with semantically obscure names.
This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_PROGUARD` variable if it is set
when a target is created.
PDB_NAME
--------

Output name for the MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` file generated by the
linker for an executable or shared library target.

This property specifies the base name for the debug symbols file.
If not set, the :prop_tgt:`OUTPUT_NAME` target property value or
logical target name is used by default.

.. |COMPILE_PDB_XXX| replace:: :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_PDB_NAME`
.. include:: PDB_NOTE.txt
<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET
------------------------

Value for symbol visibility compile flags

The ``<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET`` property determines the value passed in a
visibility related compile option, such as ``-fvisibility=`` for ``<LANG>``.
This property affects compilation in sources of all types of targets
(subject to policy :policy:`CMP0063`).

This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET` variable if it is set when a
target is created.
Fortran_FORMAT
--------------

Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the Fortran source layout.

This property tells CMake whether the Fortran source files in a target
use fixed-format or free-format.  CMake will pass the corresponding
format flag to the compiler.  Use the source-specific Fortran_FORMAT
property to change the format of a specific source file.  If the
variable CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.
IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
------------------------------------------

<CONFIG>-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.

Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

This property is ignored if the target also has a non-empty
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property.

This property is deprecated.  Use INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES instead.
IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES_<CONFIG>
------------------------------------------

<CONFIG>-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES.

Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.
Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
------------------------

Specify output directory for Fortran modules provided by the target.

If the target contains Fortran source files that provide modules and
the compiler supports a module output directory this specifies the
directory in which the modules will be placed.  When this property is
not set the modules will be placed in the build directory
corresponding to the target's source directory.  If the variable
CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.

Note that some compilers will automatically search the module output
directory for modules USEd during compilation but others will not.  If
your sources USE modules their location must be specified by
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES regardless of this property.
EXPORT_NAME
-----------

Exported name for target files.

This sets the name for the IMPORTED target generated when it this
target is is exported.  If not set, the logical target name is used by
default.
VS_USER_PROPS
-------------

Sets the user props file to be included in the visual studio
C++ project file. The standard path is
``$(UserRootDir)\\Microsoft.Cpp.$(Platform).user.props``, which is
in most cases the same as
``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\MSBuild\\v4.0\\Microsoft.Cpp.Win32.user.props``
or ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\MSBuild\\v4.0\\Microsoft.Cpp.x64.user.props``.

The ``*.user.props`` files can be used for Visual Studio wide
configuration which is independent from cmake.
ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
---------------------------------

Per-configuration output directory for
:ref:`ARCHIVE <Archive Output Artifacts>` target files.

This is a per-configuration version of the
:prop_tgt:`ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` target property, but
multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) do NOT append a
per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This
property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>` variable if
it is set when a target is created.

Contents of ``ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`` may use
:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.
ANDROID_ASSETS_DIRECTORIES
--------------------------

Set the Android assets directories to copy into the main assets
folder before build. This a string property that contains the
directory paths separated by semicolon.
This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_ASSETS_DIRECTORIES` variable if it is set when
a target is created.
VS_SCC_PROJECTNAME
------------------

Visual Studio Source Code Control Project.

Can be set to change the visual studio source code control project
name property.
COMPILE_PDB_NAME_<CONFIG>
-------------------------

Per-configuration output name for the MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` file
generated by the compiler while building source files.

This is the configuration-specific version of :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_PDB_NAME`.

.. |PDB_XXX| replace:: :prop_tgt:`PDB_NAME_<CONFIG>`
.. include:: COMPILE_PDB_NOTE.txt
LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
---------------------------------

Per-configuration output directory for
:ref:`LIBRARY <Library Output Artifacts>` target files.

This is a per-configuration version of the
:prop_tgt:`LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` target property, but
multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) do NOT append a
per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This
property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>` variable if
it is set when a target is created.

Contents of ``LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`` may use
:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.
LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>
----------------------------

Per-configuration output name for
:ref:`LIBRARY <Library Output Artifacts>` target files.

This is the configuration-specific version of the
:prop_tgt:`LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME` target property.
WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS
--------------------------

This property is implemented only for MS-compatible tools on Windows.

Enable this boolean property to automatically create a module definition
(``.def``) file with all global symbols found in the input ``.obj`` files
for a ``SHARED`` library (or executable with :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS`)
on Windows.  The module definition file will be passed to the linker
causing all symbols to be exported from the ``.dll``.
For global *data* symbols, ``__declspec(dllimport)`` must still be used when
compiling against the code in the ``.dll``.  All other function symbols will
be automatically exported and imported by callers.  This simplifies porting
projects to Windows by reducing the need for explicit ``dllexport`` markup,
even in ``C++`` classes.

When this property is enabled, zero or more ``.def`` files may also be
specified as source files of the target.  The exports named by these files
will be merged with those detected from the object files to generate a
single module definition file to be passed to the linker.  This can be
used to export symbols from a ``.dll`` that are not in any of its object
files but are added by the linker from dependencies (e.g. ``msvcrt.lib``).

This property is initialized by the value of
the :variable:`CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS` variable if it is set
when a target is created.
LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC
----------------------

End a link line such that static system libraries are used.

Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic and -Bdynamic to
determine whether to use static or shared libraries for -lXXX options.
CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link
directories for the platform.  By default CMake adds an option at the
end of the library list (if necessary) to set the linker search type
back to its starting type.  This property switches the final linker
search type to -Bstatic regardless of how it started.

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC if it is set when a target is created.

See also LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC.
COMPILE_PDB_NAME
----------------

Output name for the MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` file generated by the
compiler while building source files.

This property specifies the base name for the debug symbols file.
If not set, the default is unspecified.

.. |PDB_XXX| replace:: :prop_tgt:`PDB_NAME`
.. include:: COMPILE_PDB_NOTE.txt
<LANG>_COMPILER_LAUNCHER
------------------------

This property is implemented only when ``<LANG>`` is ``C``, ``CXX``,
``Fortran``, or ``CUDA``.

Specify a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` containing a command line
for a compiler launching tool. The :ref:`Makefile Generators` and the
:generator:`Ninja` generator will run this tool and pass the compiler and
its arguments to the tool. Some example tools are distcc and ccache.

This property is initialized by the value of
the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` variable if it is set
when a target is created.
IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>
--------------------------

<CONFIG>-specific version of IMPORTED_LOCATION property.

Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
CUDA_STANDARD
-------------

The CUDA/C++ standard whose features are requested to build this target.

This property specifies the CUDA/C++ standard whose features are requested
to build this target.  For some compilers, this results in adding a
flag such as ``-std=gnu++11`` to the compile line.

Supported values are ``98``, ``11``, ``14``.

If the value requested does not result in a compile flag being added for
the compiler in use, a previous standard flag will be added instead.  This
means that using:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY CUDA_STANDARD 11)

with a compiler which does not support ``-std=gnu++11`` or an equivalent
flag will not result in an error or warning, but will instead add the
``-std=gnu++98`` flag if supported.  This "decay" behavior may be controlled
with the :prop_tgt:`CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED` target property.
Additionally, the :prop_tgt:`CUDA_EXTENSIONS` target property may be used to
control whether compiler-specific extensions are enabled on a per-target basis.

See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

This property is initialized by the value of
the :variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD` variable if it is set when a target
is created.
ANDROID_SKIP_ANT_STEP
---------------------

Set the Android property that defines whether or not to skip the Ant build step.
This is a boolean property initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_SKIP_ANT_STEP` variable if it is set when a target is created.
COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING
---------------------------

Properties which must be string-compatible with their link interface

The ``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING`` property may contain a list of
properties for this target which must be the same when evaluated as a
string in the ``INTERFACE`` variant of the property all linked dependees.
For example, if a property ``FOO`` appears in the list, then for each
dependee, the ``INTERFACE_FOO`` property content in all of its
dependencies must be equal with each other, and with the ``FOO`` property
in the depender.  If the property is not set, then it is ignored.

Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
:ref:`Compatible Interface Properties`.
ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME
-------------------

.. |XXX| replace:: :ref:`ARCHIVE <Archive Output Artifacts>`
.. |xxx| replace:: archive
.. include:: XXX_OUTPUT_NAME.txt

See also the :prop_tgt:`ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>` target property.
GENERATOR_FILE_NAME
-------------------

Generator's file for this target.

An internal property used by some generators to record the name of the
project or dsp file associated with this target.  Note that at
configure time, this property is only set for targets created by
include_external_msproject().
<CONFIG>_OUTPUT_NAME
--------------------

Old per-configuration target file base name.
Use :prop_tgt:`OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>` instead.

This is a configuration-specific version of the :prop_tgt:`OUTPUT_NAME`
target property.
DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION
-------------------------------

Specify the .NET target framework version.

Used to specify the .NET target framework version for C++/CLI.  For
example, "v4.5".

This property is only evaluated for :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`
VS 2010 and above.

Can be initialized for all targets using the variable
:variable:`CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION`.
NAME
----

Logical name for the target.

Read-only logical name for the target as used by CMake.
HAS_CXX
-------

Link the target using the C++ linker tool (obsolete).

This is equivalent to setting the LINKER_LANGUAGE property to CXX.
See that property's documentation for details.
LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED
----------------------

Do not depend on linked shared library files.

Set this property to true to tell CMake generators not to add
file-level dependencies on the shared library files linked by this
target.  Modification to the shared libraries will not be sufficient
to re-link this target.  Logical target-level dependencies will not be
affected so the linked shared libraries will still be brought up to
date before this target is built.

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED if it is set when a target is created.
MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST
---------------------------

Specify a custom ``Info.plist`` template for a OS X and iOS Framework.

A library target with :prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK` enabled will be built as a
framework on OS X.  By default its ``Info.plist`` file is created by
configuring a template called ``MacOSXFrameworkInfo.plist.in`` located in the
:variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`.  This property specifies an alternative template
file name which may be a full path.

The following target properties may be set to specify content to be
configured into the file:

``MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_BUNDLE_VERSION``
  Sets ``CFBundleVersion``.
``MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_ICON_FILE``
  Sets ``CFBundleIconFile``.
``MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER``
  Sets ``CFBundleIdentifier``.
``MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_SHORT_VERSION_STRING``
  Sets ``CFBundleShortVersionString``.

CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all targets in a
directory that do not have each specific property set.  If a custom
``Info.plist`` is specified by this property it may of course hard-code
all the settings instead of using the target properties.
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
-------------------

Preprocessor definitions for compiling a target's sources.

The ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` property may be set to a semicolon-separated
list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax ``VAR`` or ``VAR=value``.
Function-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will
automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system
(note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some
values).

CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
by the native build tool.

.. include:: /include/COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DISCLAIMER.txt

Contents of ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` may use "generator expressions" with the
syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual
for available expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)` manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.

The corresponding :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>` property may
be set to specify per-configuration definitions.  Generator expressions
should be preferred instead of setting the alternative property.
IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM
----------------------------------

Specify #include line transforms for dependencies in a target.

This property specifies rules to transform macro-like #include lines
during implicit dependency scanning of C and C++ source files.  The
list of rules must be semicolon-separated with each entry of the form
"A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%" (the % must be literal).  During dependency
scanning occurrences of A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be
replaced by the value given with the macro argument substituted for
'%'.  For example, the entry

::

  MYDIR(%)=<mydir/%>

will convert lines of the form

::

  #include MYDIR(myheader.h)

to

::

  #include <mydir/myheader.h>

allowing the dependency to be followed.

This property applies to sources in the target on which it is set.
VS_IOT_EXTENSIONS_VERSION
-------------------------

Visual Studio Windows 10 IoT Extensions Version

Specifies the version of the IoT Extensions that should be included in the
target. For example ``10.0.10240.0``. If the value is not specified, the IoT
Extensions will not be included. To use the same version of the extensions as
the Windows 10 SDK that is being used, you can use the
:variable:`CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION` variable.
MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST
------------------------

Specify a custom ``Info.plist`` template for a OS X and iOS Application Bundle.

An executable target with :prop_tgt:`MACOSX_BUNDLE` enabled will be built as an
application bundle on OS X.  By default its ``Info.plist`` file is created
by configuring a template called ``MacOSXBundleInfo.plist.in`` located in the
:variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`.  This property specifies an alternative template
file name which may be a full path.

The following target properties may be set to specify content to be
configured into the file:

``MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_NAME``
  Sets ``CFBundleName``.
``MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_VERSION``
  Sets ``CFBundleVersion``.
``MACOSX_BUNDLE_COPYRIGHT``
  Sets ``NSHumanReadableCopyright``.
``MACOSX_BUNDLE_GUI_IDENTIFIER``
  Sets ``CFBundleIdentifier``.
``MACOSX_BUNDLE_ICON_FILE``
  Sets ``CFBundleIconFile``.
``MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_STRING``
  Sets ``CFBundleGetInfoString``.
``MACOSX_BUNDLE_LONG_VERSION_STRING``
  Sets ``CFBundleLongVersionString``.
``MACOSX_BUNDLE_SHORT_VERSION_STRING``
  Sets ``CFBundleShortVersionString``.

CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all targets in a
directory that do not have each specific property set.  If a custom
``Info.plist`` is specified by this property it may of course hard-code
all the settings instead of using the target properties.
VS_SCC_AUXPATH
--------------

Visual Studio Source Code Control Aux Path.

Can be set to change the visual studio source code control auxpath
property.
ANDROID_JAVA_SOURCE_DIR
-----------------------

Set the Android property that defines the Java source code root directories.
This a string property that contains the directory paths separated by semicolon.
This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_JAVA_SOURCE_DIR` variable if it is set
when a target is created.
VS_MOBILE_EXTENSIONS_VERSION
----------------------------

Visual Studio Windows 10 Mobile Extensions Version

Specifies the version of the Mobile Extensions that should be included in the
target. For example ``10.0.10240.0``. If the value is not specified, the Mobile
Extensions will not be included. To use the same version of the extensions as
the Windows 10 SDK that is being used, you can use the
:variable:`CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION` variable.
LINK_FLAGS
----------

Additional flags to use when linking this target.

The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags to the link
step of a target.  :prop_tgt:`LINK_FLAGS_<CONFIG>` will add to the
configuration ``<CONFIG>``, for example, ``DEBUG``, ``RELEASE``,
``MINSIZEREL``, ``RELWITHDEBINFO``, ...
JOB_POOL_COMPILE
----------------

Ninja only: Pool used for compiling.

The number of parallel compile processes could be limited by defining
pools with the global :prop_gbl:`JOB_POOLS`
property and then specifying here the pool name.

For instance:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set_property(TARGET myexe PROPERTY JOB_POOL_COMPILE ten_jobs)

This property is initialized by the value of
:variable:`CMAKE_JOB_POOL_COMPILE`.
XCODE_PRODUCT_TYPE
------------------

Set the Xcode ``productType`` attribute on its reference to a
target.  CMake computes a default based on target type but
can be told explicitly with this property.

See also :prop_tgt:`XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE`.
COMPILE_FEATURES
----------------

Compiler features enabled for this target.

The list of features in this property are a subset of the features listed
in the :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILE_FEATURES` variable.

Contents of ``COMPILE_FEATURES`` may use "generator expressions" with the
syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual for
available expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual
for information on compile features and a list of supported compilers.
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES
------------------------

List public interface libraries for a library.

This property contains the list of transitive link dependencies.  When
the target is linked into another target using the
:command:`target_link_libraries` command, the libraries listed (and
recursively their link interface libraries) will be provided to the
other target also.  This property is overridden by the
:prop_tgt:`LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES` or
:prop_tgt:`LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>` property if policy
:policy:`CMP0022` is ``OLD`` or unset.

Contents of ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
manual for available expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)`
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

Creating Relocatable Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. |INTERFACE_PROPERTY_LINK| replace:: ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES``
.. include:: /include/INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_WARNING.txt
ANDROID_PROCESS_MAX
-------------------

Set the Android property that defines the maximum number of a
parallel Android NDK compiler processes (e.g. ``4``).
This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_PROCESS_MAX` variable if it is set
when a target is created.
RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
---------------------------------

Per-configuration output directory for
:ref:`RUNTIME <Runtime Output Artifacts>` target files.

This is a per-configuration version of the
:prop_tgt:`RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` target property, but
multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) do NOT append a
per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This
property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>` variable if
it is set when a target is created.

Contents of ``RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`` may use
:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.
INTERFACE_SOURCES
-----------------

List of interface sources to compile into consuming targets.

Targets may populate this property to publish the sources
for consuming targets to compile.  The :command:`target_sources` command
populates this property with values given to the ``PUBLIC`` and
``INTERFACE`` keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.

When target dependencies are specified using :command:`target_link_libraries`,
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to determine the
sources of the consumer.

Contents of ``INTERFACE_SOURCES`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
manual for available expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)`
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
------------------------

``BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH`` is a boolean specifying whether to link the target
in the build tree with the :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_RPATH`.  This takes precedence
over :prop_tgt:`SKIP_BUILD_RPATH` and avoids the need for relinking before
installation.

This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH` variable if it is set when a target
is created.

If policy :policy:`CMP0068` is not ``NEW``, this property also controls use of
:prop_tgt:`INSTALL_NAME_DIR` in the build tree on macOS.  Either way, the
:prop_tgt:`BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR` target property takes precedence.
LOCATION_<CONFIG>
-----------------

Read-only property providing a target location on disk.

A read-only property that indicates where a target's main file is
located on disk for the configuration <CONFIG>.  The property is
defined only for library and executable targets.  An imported target
may provide a set of configurations different from that of the
importing project.  By default CMake looks for an exact-match but
otherwise uses an arbitrary available configuration.  Use the
MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG> property to map imported configurations
explicitly.

Do not set properties that affect the location of a target after
reading this property.  These include properties whose names match
"(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_<CONFIG>)?",
``(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)``, or "LINKER_LANGUAGE".  Failure to follow
this rule is not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target
undefined.
LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
---------------------------

Repetition count for STATIC libraries with cyclic dependencies.

When linking to a STATIC library target with cyclic dependencies the
linker may need to scan more than once through the archives in the
strongly connected component of the dependency graph.  CMake by
default constructs the link line so that the linker will scan through
the component at least twice.  This property specifies the minimum
number of scans if it is larger than the default.  CMake uses the
largest value specified by any target in a component.
MACOSX_RPATH
------------

Whether this target on OS X or iOS is located at runtime using rpaths.

When this property is set to ``TRUE``, the directory portion of
the ``install_name`` field of this shared library will be ``@rpath``
unless overridden by :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_NAME_DIR`.  This indicates
the shared library is to be found at runtime using runtime
paths (rpaths).

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
:variable:`CMAKE_MACOSX_RPATH` if it is set when a target is
created.

Runtime paths will also be embedded in binaries using this target and
can be controlled by the :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_RPATH` target property on
the target linking to this target.

Policy :policy:`CMP0042` was introduced to change the default value of
``MACOSX_RPATH`` to ``TRUE``.  This is because use of ``@rpath`` is a
more flexible and powerful alternative to ``@executable_path`` and
``@loader_path``.
FRAMEWORK_VERSION
-----------------

Version of a framework created using the :prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK` target
property (e.g. ``A``).

This property only affects OS X, as iOS doesn't have versioned
directory structure.
ANDROID_PROGUARD_CONFIG_PATH
----------------------------

Set the Android property that specifies the location of the ProGuard
config file. Leave empty to use the default one.
This a string property that contains the path to ProGuard config file.
This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_PROGUARD_CONFIG_PATH` variable if it is set
when a target is created.
IMPORTED_SONAME
---------------

The "soname" of an IMPORTED target of shared library type.

Set this to the "soname" embedded in an imported shared library.  This
is meaningful only on platforms supporting the feature.  Ignored for
non-imported targets.
<LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE
---------------------------

This property is implemented only when ``<LANG>`` is ``C`` or ``CXX``.

Specify a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` containing a command
line for the ``include-what-you-use`` tool.  The :ref:`Makefile Generators`
and the :generator:`Ninja` generator will run this tool along with the
compiler and report a warning if the tool reports any problems.

This property is initialized by the value of
the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE` variable if it is set
when a target is created.
OSX_ARCHITECTURES_<CONFIG>
--------------------------

Per-configuration OS X and iOS binary architectures for a target.

This property is the configuration-specific version of
:prop_tgt:`OSX_ARCHITECTURES`.
VS_GLOBAL_ROOTNAMESPACE
-----------------------

Visual Studio project root namespace.

Sets the "RootNamespace" attribute for a generated Visual Studio
project.  The attribute will be generated only if this is set.
AUTOUIC
-------

Should the target be processed with autouic (for Qt projects).

``AUTOUIC`` is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle
the Qt ``uic`` code generator automatically, i.e. without having to use
the :module:`QT4_WRAP_UI() <FindQt4>` or ``QT5_WRAP_UI()`` macro. Currently
Qt4 and Qt5 are supported.

When this property is ``ON``, CMake will scan the source files at build time
and invoke ``uic`` accordingly.  If an ``#include`` statement like
``#include "ui_foo.h"`` is found in ``source.cpp``, a ``foo.ui`` file is
searched for first in the vicinity of ``source.cpp`` and afterwards in the
optional :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS` of the target.
``uic`` is run on the ``foo.ui`` file to generate ``ui_foo.h`` in the directory
``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/include``,
which is automatically added to the target's :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`.

* For :prop_gbl:`multi configuration generators <GENERATOR_IS_MULTI_CONFIG>`,
  the include directory is ``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/include_<CONFIG>``.

* See :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR`.

This property is initialized by the value of the :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOUIC`
variable if it is set when a target is created.

Additional command line options for ``uic`` can be set via the
:prop_sf:`AUTOUIC_OPTIONS` source file property on the ``foo.ui`` file.
The global property :prop_gbl:`AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER` can be used to group the
autouic targets together in an IDE, e.g. in MSVS.

Source files can be excluded from :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` processing by
enabling :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOUIC` or the broader :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOGEN`.

The number of parallel ``uic`` processes to start can be modified by
setting :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_PARALLEL`.

See the :manual:`cmake-qt(7)` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
C_STANDARD_REQUIRED
-------------------

Boolean describing whether the value of :prop_tgt:`C_STANDARD` is a requirement.

If this property is set to ``ON``, then the value of the
:prop_tgt:`C_STANDARD` target property is treated as a requirement.  If this
property is ``OFF`` or unset, the :prop_tgt:`C_STANDARD` target property is
treated as optional and may "decay" to a previous standard if the requested is
not available.  For compilers that have no notion of a standard level, such as
MSVC, this has no effect.

See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

This property is initialized by the value of
the :variable:`CMAKE_C_STANDARD_REQUIRED` variable if it is set when a
target is created.
C_EXTENSIONS
------------

Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.

This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be
used.  For some compilers, this results in adding a flag such
as ``-std=gnu11`` instead of ``-std=c11`` to the compile line.  This
property is ``ON`` by default. The basic C standard level is
controlled by the :prop_tgt:`C_STANDARD` target property.

See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

This property is initialized by the value of
the :variable:`CMAKE_C_EXTENSIONS` variable if it is set when a target
is created.
ENABLE_EXPORTS
--------------

Specify whether an executable exports symbols for loadable modules.

Normally an executable does not export any symbols because it is the
final program.  It is possible for an executable to export symbols to
be used by loadable modules.  When this property is set to true CMake
will allow other targets to "link" to the executable with the
:command:`TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES` command.  On all platforms a target-level
dependency on the executable is created for targets that link to it.
For DLL platforms an import library will be created for the exported
symbols and then used for linking.  All Windows-based systems
including Cygwin are DLL platforms.  For non-DLL platforms that
require all symbols to be resolved at link time, such as OS X, the
module will "link" to the executable using a flag like
``-bundle_loader``.  For other non-DLL platforms the link rule is simply
ignored since the dynamic loader will automatically bind symbols when
the module is loaded.

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
:variable:`CMAKE_ENABLE_EXPORTS` if it is set when a target is created.
VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES_COPY_LOCAL
-------------------------------

Sets the **Copy Local** property for all .NET hint references in the target

Boolean property to enable/disable copying of .NET hint references to
output directory. The default is ``ON``.
LINK_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
-------------------

Per-configuration linker flags for a target.

This is the configuration-specific version of LINK_FLAGS.
LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE
---------------------------

This is a boolean option that when set to ``TRUE`` will automatically run
``ldd -r -u`` on the target after it is linked. In addition, the linker flag
``-Wl,--no-as-needed`` will be passed to the target with the link command so
that all libraries specified on the command line will be linked into the
target. This will result in the link producing a list of libraries that
provide no symbols used by this target but are being linked to it.
This is only applicable to executable and shared library targets and
will only work when ld and ldd accept the flags used.

This property is initialized by the value of
the :variable:`CMAKE_LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE` variable if it is set
when a target is created.
IMPORTED_LIBNAME
----------------

Specify the link library name for an :ref:`imported <Imported Targets>`
:ref:`Interface Library <Interface Libraries>`.

An interface library builds no library file itself but does specify
usage requirements for its consumers.  The ``IMPORTED_LIBNAME``
property may be set to specify a single library name to be placed
on the link line in place of the interface library target name as
a requirement for using the interface.

This property is intended for use in naming libraries provided by
a platform SDK for which the full path to a library file may not
be known.  The value may be a plain library name such as ``foo``
but may *not* be a path (e.g. ``/usr/lib/libfoo.so``) or a flag
(e.g. ``-Wl,...``).  The name is never treated as a library target
name even if it happens to name one.

The ``IMPORTED_LIBNAME`` property is allowed only on
:ref:`imported <Imported Targets>` :ref:`Interface Libraries`
and is rejected on targets of other types (for which
the :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION` target property may be used).
AUTOMOC
-------

Should the target be processed with automoc (for Qt projects).

AUTOMOC is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle the Qt ``moc``
preprocessor automatically, i.e.  without having to use the
:module:`QT4_WRAP_CPP() <FindQt4>` or QT5_WRAP_CPP() macro.
Currently Qt4 and Qt5 are supported.

When this property is set ``ON``, CMake will scan the header and
source files at build time and invoke moc accordingly.

* If an ``#include`` statement like ``#include "moc_<basename>.cpp"`` is found,
  a macro from :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES` is expected to appear in the
  ``<basename>.h(xx)`` header file. ``moc`` is run on the header
  file to generate ``moc_<basename>.cpp`` in the
  ``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/include`` directory which is automatically added
  to the target's :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`.
  This allows the compiler to find the included ``moc_<basename>.cpp`` file
  regardless of the location the original source.

  * For :prop_gbl:`multi configuration generators <GENERATOR_IS_MULTI_CONFIG>`,
    the include directory is ``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/include_<CONFIG>``.

  * See :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR`.

* If an ``#include`` statement like ``#include "<basename>.moc"`` is found,
  a macro from :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES` is expected to appear in the
  source file and ``moc`` is run on the source file itself.

* Header files that are not included by an ``#include "moc_<basename>.cpp"``
  statement are nonetheless scanned for a macro out of
  :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES`.
  The resulting ``moc_<basename>.cpp`` files are generated in custom
  directories and automatically included in a generated
  ``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/mocs_compilation.cpp`` file,
  which is compiled as part of the target.

  * The custom directories with checksum
    based names help to avoid name collisions for ``moc`` files with the same
    ``<basename>``.

  * See :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR`.

* Additionally, header files with the same base name as a source file,
  (like ``<basename>.h``) or ``_p`` appended to the base name (like
  ``<basename>_p.h``), are scanned for a macro out of
  :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES`, and if found, ``moc``
  is also executed on those files.

* ``AUTOMOC`` always checks multiple header alternative extensions,
  such as ``hpp``, ``hxx``, etc. when searching for headers.

* ``AUTOMOC`` looks for the ``Q_PLUGIN_METADATA`` macro and reruns the
  ``moc`` when the file addressed by the ``FILE`` argument of the macro changes.

This property is initialized by the value of the :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOMOC`
variable if it is set when a target is created.

Additional command line options for ``moc`` can be set via the
:prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS` property.

By enabling the :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE` variable the
rules for searching the files which will be processed by ``moc`` can be relaxed.
See the documentation for this variable for more details.

The global property :prop_gbl:`AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER` can be used to group the
automoc targets together in an IDE, e.g.  in MSVS.

The global property :prop_gbl:`AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP` can be used to group
files generated by :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` together in an IDE, e.g.  in MSVS.

Additional macro names to search for can be added to
:prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES`.

Additional ``moc`` dependency file names can be extracted from source code
by using :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS`.

Compiler pre definitions for ``moc`` are written to a ``moc_predefs.h`` file
which is controlled by :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES`.

Source C++ files can be excluded from :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` processing by
enabling :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOMOC` or the broader :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOGEN`.

The number of parallel ``moc`` processes to start can be modified by
setting :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_PARALLEL`.

See the :manual:`cmake-qt(7)` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
VS_DOTNET_REFERENCEPROP_<refname>_TAG_<tagname>
-----------------------------------------------

Defines an XML property ``<tagname>`` for a .NET reference
``<refname>``.

Reference properties can be set for .NET references which are
defined by the target properties :prop_tgt:`VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES`,
:prop_tgt:`VS_DOTNET_REFERENCE_<refname>`
and also for project references to other C# targets which are
established by :command:`target_link_libraries()`.

This property is only applicable to C# targets and Visual Studio
generators 2010 and later.
SUFFIX
------

What comes after the target name.

A target property that can be set to override the suffix (such as
".so" or ".exe") on the name of a library, module or executable.
LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_<CONFIG>
------------------------------------

Per-configuration repetition count for cycles of STATIC libraries.

This is the configuration-specific version of
LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.
AUTORCC
-------

Should the target be processed with autorcc (for Qt projects).

``AUTORCC`` is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle
the Qt ``rcc`` code generator automatically, i.e. without having to use
the :module:`QT4_ADD_RESOURCES() <FindQt4>` or ``QT5_ADD_RESOURCES()``
macro.  Currently Qt4 and Qt5 are supported.

When this property is ``ON``, CMake will handle ``.qrc`` files added
as target sources at build time and invoke ``rcc`` accordingly.
This property is initialized by the value of the :variable:`CMAKE_AUTORCC`
variable if it is set when a target is created.

By default :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC` is processed inside a
:command:`custom command <add_custom_command>`.
If the ``.qrc`` file is :prop_sf:`GENERATED` though, a
:command:`custom target <add_custom_target>` is used instead.

Additional command line options for rcc can be set via the
:prop_sf:`AUTORCC_OPTIONS` source file property on the ``.qrc`` file.

The global property :prop_gbl:`AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER` can be used to group
the autorcc targets together in an IDE, e.g. in MSVS.

The global property :prop_gbl:`AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP` can be used to group
files generated by :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC` together in an IDE, e.g.  in MSVS.

When there are multiple ``.qrc`` files with the same name, CMake will
generate unspecified unique names for ``rcc``.  Therefore if
``Q_INIT_RESOURCE()`` or ``Q_CLEANUP_RESOURCE()`` need to be used the
``.qrc`` file name must be unique.

Source files can be excluded from :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC` processing by
enabling :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTORCC` or the broader :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOGEN`.

See the :manual:`cmake-qt(7)` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN
-------------------------

Whether to add a compile flag to hide symbols of inline functions

The ``VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN`` property determines whether a flag for
hiding symbols for inline functions, such as ``-fvisibility-inlines-hidden``,
should be used when invoking the compiler.  This property affects compilation
in sources of all types of targets (subject to policy :policy:`CMP0063`).

This property is initialized by
the value of the :variable:`CMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN` variable if it
is set when a target is created.
AUTOUIC_OPTIONS
---------------

Additional options for ``uic`` when using :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`

This property holds additional command line options which will be used when
``uic`` is executed during the build via :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`, i.e. it is
equivalent to the optional ``OPTIONS`` argument of the
:module:`qt4_wrap_ui() <FindQt4>` macro.

By default it is empty.

This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS` variable if it is set when a target is
created.

The options set on the target may be overridden by :prop_sf:`AUTOUIC_OPTIONS`
set on the ``.ui`` source file.

This property may use "generator expressions" with the syntax ``$<...>``.
See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual for available
expressions.

See the :manual:`cmake-qt(7)` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

EXAMPLE
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cmake

  # ...
  set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY AUTOUIC_OPTIONS "--no-protection")
  # ...
IMPORT_SUFFIX
-------------

What comes after the import library name.

Similar to the target property SUFFIX, but used for import libraries
(typically corresponding to a DLL) instead of regular libraries.  A
target property that can be set to override the suffix (such as
".lib") on an import library name.
DEPLOYMENT_REMOTE_DIRECTORY
---------------------------

Set the WinCE project ``RemoteDirectory`` in ``DeploymentTool`` and
``RemoteExecutable`` in ``DebuggerTool`` in ``.vcproj`` files generated
by the :generator:`Visual Studio 9 2008` generator.
This is useful when you want to debug on remote WinCE device.
For example:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set_property(TARGET ${TARGET} PROPERTY
    DEPLOYMENT_REMOTE_DIRECTORY "\\FlashStorage")

produces::

  <DeploymentTool RemoteDirectory="\FlashStorage" ... />
  <DebuggerTool RemoteExecutable="\FlashStorage\target_file" ... />
EchoString
----------

A message to be displayed when the target is built.

A message to display on some generators (such as makefiles) when the
target is built.
VS_DOTNET_REFERENCE_<refname>
-----------------------------

Visual Studio managed project .NET reference with name ``<refname>``
and hint path.

Adds one .NET reference to generated Visual Studio project. The
reference will have the name ``<refname>`` and will point to the
assembly given as value of the property.

See also :prop_tgt:`VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES` and
:prop_tgt:`VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES_COPY_LOCAL`
RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
-------------------

Specify a launcher for compile rules.

See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global and directory property for a target.
STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
-----------------------------

Per-configuration flags for creating a static library.

This is the configuration-specific version of STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS.
POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
-------------------

Deprecated install support.

The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are the old
way to specify CMake scripts to run before and after installing a
target.  They are used only when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is
used to install the target.  Use the INSTALL command instead.
VS_WINRT_REFERENCES
-------------------

Visual Studio project Windows Runtime Metadata references

Adds one or more semicolon-delimited WinRT references to a generated
Visual Studio project.  For example, "Windows;Windows.UI.Core".
IMPORTED_LIBNAME_<CONFIG>
-------------------------

<CONFIG>-specific version of :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LIBNAME` property.

Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
ANDROID_ARCH
------------

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android with NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual Studio
Edition`, this property sets the Android target architecture.

This is a string property that could be set to the one of
the following values:

* ``armv7-a``: "ARMv7-A (armv7-a)"
* ``armv7-a-hard``: "ARMv7-A, hard-float ABI (armv7-a)"
* ``arm64-v8a``: "ARMv8-A, 64bit (arm64-v8a)"
* ``x86``: "x86 (x86)"
* ``x86_64``: "x86_64 (x86_64)"

This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH` variable if it is set
when a target is created.
SKIP_BUILD_RPATH
----------------

Should rpaths be used for the build tree.

SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip automatic
generation of an rpath allowing the target to run from the build tree.
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH if it is set when a target is created.
IMPORTED_NO_SONAME
------------------

Specifies that an IMPORTED shared library target has no "soname".

Set this property to true for an imported shared library file that has
no "soname" field.  CMake may adjust generated link commands for some
platforms to prevent the linker from using the path to the library in
place of its missing soname.  Ignored for non-imported targets.
CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED
---------------------

Boolean describing whether the value of :prop_tgt:`CXX_STANDARD` is a requirement.

If this property is set to ``ON``, then the value of the
:prop_tgt:`CXX_STANDARD` target property is treated as a requirement.  If this
property is ``OFF`` or unset, the :prop_tgt:`CXX_STANDARD` target property is
treated as optional and may "decay" to a previous standard if the requested is
not available.  For compilers that have no notion of a standard level, such as
MSVC, this has no effect.

See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

This property is initialized by the value of
the :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED` variable if it is set when a
target is created.
FOLDER
------

Set the folder name. Use to organize targets in an IDE.

Targets with no FOLDER property will appear as top level entities in
IDEs like Visual Studio.  Targets with the same FOLDER property value
will appear next to each other in a folder of that name.  To nest
folders, use FOLDER values such as 'GUI/Dialogs' with '/' characters
separating folder levels.

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
:variable:`CMAKE_FOLDER` if it is set when a target is created.
SOURCE_DIR
----------

This read-only property reports the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` variable in the directory in which
the target was defined.
VS_SCC_LOCALPATH
----------------

Visual Studio Source Code Control Local Path.

Can be set to change the visual studio source code control local path
property.
LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC
------------------------

Assume the linker looks for static libraries by default.

Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic and -Bdynamic to
determine whether to use static or shared libraries for -lXXX options.
CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link
directories for the platform.  By default the linker search type is
assumed to be -Bdynamic at the beginning of the library list.  This
property switches the assumption to -Bstatic.  It is intended for use
when linking an executable statically (e.g.  with the GNU -static
option).

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC if it is set when a target is created.

See also LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC.
ANDROID_JAR_DIRECTORIES
-----------------------

Set the Android property that specifies directories to search for
the JAR libraries.

This a string property that contains the directory paths separated by
semicolons. This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_JAR_DIRECTORIES` variable if it is set when
a target is created.

Contents of ``ANDROID_JAR_DIRECTORIES`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
manual for available expressions.
VS_IOT_STARTUP_TASK
-------------------

Visual Studio Windows 10 IoT Continuous Background Task

Specifies that the target should be compiled as a Continuous Background Task library.
ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DIRECTORIES
------------------------------

Set the Android property that specifies directories to search for the
.so libraries.

This a string property that contains the directory paths separated
by semicolons.

This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DIRECTORIES` variable if it is set when a
target is created.

Contents of ``ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DIRECTORIES`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
manual for available expressions.
IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
------------------------------------

Repetition count for cycles of IMPORTED static libraries.

This is LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY for IMPORTED targets.
OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>
--------------------

Per-configuration target file base name.

This is the configuration-specific version of the :prop_tgt:`OUTPUT_NAME`
target property.
RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
------------------

Specify a launcher for custom rules.

See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global and directory property for a target.
CUDA_RESOLVE_DEVICE_SYMBOLS
---------------------------

CUDA only: Enables device linking for the specific static library target

If set this will enable device linking on this static library target. Normally
device linking is deferred until a shared library or executable is generated,
allowing for multiple static libraries to resolve device symbols at the same
time.

For instance:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set_property(TARGET mystaticlib PROPERTY CUDA_RESOLVE_DEVICE_SYMBOLS ON)
RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>
----------------------------

Per-configuration output name for
:ref:`RUNTIME <Runtime Output Artifacts>` target files.

This is the configuration-specific version of the
:prop_tgt:`RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME` target property.
NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED
-----------------------

Do not treat include directories from the interfaces of consumed
:ref:`imported targets` as ``SYSTEM``.

The contents of the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` target property
of imported targets are treated as ``SYSTEM`` includes by default.  If this
property is enabled on a target, compilation of sources in that target will
not treat the contents of the ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` of consumed
imported targets as system includes.

This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED` variable if it is set when a target
is created.
COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
-------------------------------------

Per-configuration output directory for the MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` file
generated by the compiler while building source files.

This is a per-configuration version of
:prop_tgt:`COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`,
but multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) do NOT append a
per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This
property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>` variable
if it is set when a target is created.

.. |PDB_XXX| replace:: :prop_tgt:`PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`
.. include:: COMPILE_PDB_NOTE.txt
BINARY_DIR
----------

This read-only property reports the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` variable in the directory in which
the target was defined.
TYPE
----

The type of the target.

This read-only property can be used to test the type of the given
target.  It will be one of STATIC_LIBRARY, MODULE_LIBRARY,
SHARED_LIBRARY, INTERFACE_LIBRARY, EXECUTABLE or one of the internal
target types.
AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS
-------------------

Additional options for moc when using :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC`

This property is only used if the :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` property is ``ON``
for this target.  In this case, it holds additional command line
options which will be used when ``moc`` is executed during the build, i.e.
it is equivalent to the optional ``OPTIONS`` argument of the
:module:`qt4_wrap_cpp() <FindQt4>` macro.

By default it is empty.

See the :manual:`cmake-qt(7)` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES
---------------------------------

Dependent shared libraries of an imported shared library.

Shared libraries may be linked to other shared libraries as part of
their implementation.  On some platforms the linker searches for the
dependent libraries of shared libraries they are including in the
link.  Set this property to the list of dependent shared libraries of
an imported library.  The list should be disjoint from the list of
interface libraries in the INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property.  On
platforms requiring dependent shared libraries to be found at link
time CMake uses this list to add appropriate files or paths to the
link command line.  Ignored for non-imported targets.
COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME
-----------------------

By setting this target property, the target is configured to build with
``C++/CLI`` support.

The Visual Studio generator defines the ``clr`` parameter depending on
the value of ``COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME``:

* property not set: native C++ (i.e. default)
* property set but empty: mixed unmanaged/managed C++
* property set to any non empty value: managed C++

Supported values: ``""``, ``"pure"``, ``"safe"``

This property is only evaluated :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for
VS 2010 and above.

To be able to build managed C++ targets with VS 2017 and above the component
``C++/CLI support`` must be installed, which may not be done by default.

See also :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME`
CXX_EXTENSIONS
--------------

Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.

This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be
used.  For some compilers, this results in adding a flag such
as ``-std=gnu++11`` instead of ``-std=c++11`` to the compile line.  This
property is ``ON`` by default. The basic C++ standard level is
controlled by the :prop_tgt:`CXX_STANDARD` target property.

See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

This property is initialized by the value of
the :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS` variable if it is set when a target
is created.
VS_GLOBAL_<variable>
--------------------

Visual Studio project-specific global variable.

Tell the Visual Studio generator to set the global variable
'<variable>' to a given value in the generated Visual Studio project.
Ignored on other generators.  Qt integration works better if
VS_GLOBAL_QtVersion is set to the version FindQt4.cmake found.  For
example, "4.7.3"
VS_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION
----------------------------------

Specify the .NET target framework version.

Used to specify the .NET target framework version for C++/CLI.  For
example, "v4.5".

This property is deprecated and should not be used anymore. Use
:prop_tgt:`DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION` instead.
GNUtoMS
-------

Convert GNU import library (.dll.a) to MS format (.lib).

When linking a shared library or executable that exports symbols using
GNU tools on Windows (MinGW/MSYS) with Visual Studio installed convert
the import library (.dll.a) from GNU to MS format (.lib).  Both import
libraries will be installed by install(TARGETS) and exported by
install(EXPORT) and export() to be linked by applications with either
GNU- or MS-compatible tools.

If the variable CMAKE_GNUtoMS is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.  The variable must be set
prior to the first command that enables a language such as project()
or enable_language().  CMake provides the variable as an option to the
user automatically when configuring on Windows with GNU tools.
IMPORTED_NO_SONAME_<CONFIG>
---------------------------

<CONFIG>-specific version of IMPORTED_NO_SONAME property.

Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
SOURCES
-------

Source names specified for a target.

List of sources specified for a target.
VS_CONFIGURATION_TYPE
---------------------

Visual Studio project configuration type.

Sets the ``ConfigurationType`` attribute for a generated Visual Studio project.
If this property is set, it overrides the default setting that is based on the
target type (e.g. ``StaticLibrary``, ``Application``, ...).

Supported on :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and higher.
INTERFACE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS
-------------------------

List of interface options to pass to uic.

Targets may populate this property to publish the options
required to use when invoking ``uic``.  Consuming targets can add entries to their
own :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC_OPTIONS` property such as
``$<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,INTERFACE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS>`` to use the uic options
specified in the interface of ``foo``. This is done automatically by
the :command:`target_link_libraries` command.

This property supports generator expressions.  See the
:manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual for available expressions.
BUNDLE_EXTENSION
----------------

The file extension used to name a :prop_tgt:`BUNDLE`, a :prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK`,
or a :prop_tgt:`MACOSX_BUNDLE` target on the OS X and iOS.

The default value is ``bundle``, ``framework``, or ``app`` for the respective
target types.
FRAMEWORK
---------

Build ``SHARED`` or ``STATIC`` library as Framework Bundle on the OS X and iOS.

If such a library target has this property set to ``TRUE`` it will be
built as a framework when built on the OS X and iOS.  It will have the
directory structure required for a framework and will be suitable to
be used with the ``-framework`` option

To customize ``Info.plist`` file in the framework, use
:prop_tgt:`MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST` target property.

For OS X see also the :prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK_VERSION` target property.

Example of creation ``dynamicFramework``:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(dynamicFramework SHARED
              dynamicFramework.c
              dynamicFramework.h
  )
  set_target_properties(dynamicFramework PROPERTIES
    FRAMEWORK TRUE
    FRAMEWORK_VERSION C
    MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER com.cmake.dynamicFramework
    MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST Info.plist
    # "current version" in semantic format in Mach-O binary file
    VERSION 16.4.0
    # "compatibility version" in semantic format in Mach-O binary file
    SOVERSION 1.0.0
    PUBLIC_HEADER dynamicFramework.h
    XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY "iPhone Developer"
  )
COMPILE_FLAGS
-------------

Additional flags to use when compiling this target's sources.

The ``COMPILE_FLAGS`` property sets additional compiler flags used to
build sources within the target.  Use :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`
to pass additional preprocessor definitions.

This property is deprecated.  Use the :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_OPTIONS`
property or the :command:`target_compile_options` command instead.
C_STANDARD
----------

The C standard whose features are requested to build this target.

This property specifies the C standard whose features are requested
to build this target.  For some compilers, this results in adding a
flag such as ``-std=gnu11`` to the compile line.  For compilers that
have no notion of a standard level, such as Microsoft Visual C++ before
2015 Update 3, this has no effect.

Supported values are ``90``, ``99`` and ``11``.

If the value requested does not result in a compile flag being added for
the compiler in use, a previous standard flag will be added instead.  This
means that using:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY C_STANDARD 11)

with a compiler which does not support ``-std=gnu11`` or an equivalent
flag will not result in an error or warning, but will instead add the
``-std=gnu99`` or ``-std=gnu90`` flag if supported.  This "decay" behavior may
be controlled with the :prop_tgt:`C_STANDARD_REQUIRED` target property.
Additionally, the :prop_tgt:`C_EXTENSIONS` target property may be used to
control whether compiler-specific extensions are enabled on a per-target basis.

See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

This property is initialized by the value of
the :variable:`CMAKE_C_STANDARD` variable if it is set when a target
is created.
EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
----------------

Exclude the target from the all target.

A property on a target that indicates if the target is excluded from
the default build target.  If it is not, then with a Makefile for
example typing make will cause this target to be built.  The same
concept applies to the default build of other generators.  Installing
a target with EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true has undefined behavior.
ALIASED_TARGET
--------------

Name of target aliased by this target.

If this is an :ref:`Alias Target <Alias Targets>`, this property contains
the name of the target aliased.
IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED
--------------------

Build a combined (device and simulator) target when installing.

When this property is set to set to false (which is the default) then it will
either be built with the device SDK or the simulator SDK depending on the SDK
set. But if this property is set to true then the target will at install time
also be built for the corresponding SDK and combined into one library.

This feature requires at least Xcode version 6.
ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
------------------------

.. |XXX| replace:: :ref:`ARCHIVE <Archive Output Artifacts>`
.. |xxx| replace:: archive
.. |CMAKE_XXX_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY| replace:: CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
.. include:: XXX_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY.txt

See also the :prop_tgt:`ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>` target property.
AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS
--------------------

Search path list used by :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` to find included
``.ui`` files.

This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS` variable if it is set
when a target is created. Otherwise it is empty.

See the :manual:`cmake-qt(7)` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
-----------------------------

Per-configuration output directory for the MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` file
generated by the linker for an executable or shared library target.

This is a per-configuration version of :prop_tgt:`PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`,
but multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) do NOT append a
per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This
property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>` variable if it is
set when a target is created.

Contents of ``PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`` may use
:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.

.. |COMPILE_PDB_XXX| replace:: :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`
.. include:: PDB_NOTE.txt
CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR
-----------------------

Use the given emulator to run executables created when crosscompiling.
This command will be added as a prefix to :command:`add_test`,
:command:`add_custom_command`, and :command:`add_custom_target` commands
for built target system executables.

This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR` variable if it is set when a target
is created.
IMPORTED_IMPLIB
---------------

Full path to the import library for an IMPORTED target.

Set this to the location of the ".lib" part of a windows DLL.  Ignored
for non-imported targets.
MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>
----------------------------

Map from project configuration to
:ref:`imported target <IMPORTED targets>`'s configuration.

Set this to the list of configurations of an imported target that may
be used for the current project's ``<CONFIG>`` configuration.  Targets
imported from another project may not provide the same set of
configuration names available in the current project.  Setting this
property tells CMake what imported configurations are suitable for use
when building the ``<CONFIG>`` configuration.  The first configuration in
the list found to be provided by the imported target (i.e. via
:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>` for the mapped-to ``<CONFIG>``)
is selected.  As a special case, an empty list element refers to the
configuration-less imported target location
(i.e. :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION`).

If this property is set and no matching configurations are available,
then the imported target is considered to be not found.  This property
is ignored for non-imported targets.

This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>` variable if it is set when a
target is created.

Example
^^^^^^^

For example creating imported C++ library ``foo``:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(foo STATIC IMPORTED)

Use ``foo_debug`` path for ``Debug`` build type:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set_property(
    TARGET foo APPEND PROPERTY IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS DEBUG
    )

  set_target_properties(foo PROPERTIES
    IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES_DEBUG "CXX"
    IMPORTED_LOCATION_DEBUG "${foo_debug}"
    )

Use ``foo_release`` path for ``Release`` build type:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set_property(
    TARGET foo APPEND PROPERTY IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS RELEASE
    )

  set_target_properties(foo PROPERTIES
    IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES_RELEASE "CXX"
    IMPORTED_LOCATION_RELEASE "${foo_release}"
    )

Use ``Release`` version of library for ``MinSizeRel`` and ``RelWithDebInfo``
build types:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set_target_properties(foo PROPERTIES
    MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_MINSIZEREL Release
    MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_RELWITHDEBINFO Release
    )
VERSION
-------

What version number is this target.

For shared libraries ``VERSION`` and :prop_tgt:`SOVERSION` can be used
to specify the build version and API version respectively.  When building or
installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports
symlinks and the linker supports so-names.  If only one of both is
specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number.  For
executables ``VERSION`` can be used to specify the build version.  When
building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the
platform supports symlinks.

Windows Versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For shared libraries and executables on Windows the ``VERSION``
attribute is parsed to extract a ``<major>.<minor>`` version number.
These numbers are used as the image version of the binary.

Mach-O Versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For shared libraries and executables on Mach-O systems (e.g. OS X, iOS),
the :prop_tgt:`SOVERSION` property correspond to *compatibility version* and
``VERSION`` to *current version*.  See the :prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK` target
property for an example.  Versions of Mach-O binaries may be checked with the
``otool -L <binary>`` command.
LINK_DEPENDS
------------

Additional files on which a target binary depends for linking.

Specifies a semicolon-separated list of full-paths to files on which
the link rule for this target depends.  The target binary will be
linked if any of the named files is newer than it.

This property is ignored by non-Makefile generators.  It is intended
to specify dependencies on "linker scripts" for custom Makefile link
rules.
XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE
------------------------

Set the Xcode ``explicitFileType`` attribute on its reference to a
target.  CMake computes a default based on target type but
can be told explicitly with this property.

See also :prop_tgt:`XCODE_PRODUCT_TYPE`.
COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN
-------------------------------

Properties whose maximum value from the link interface will be used.

The ``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN`` property may contain a list of
properties for this target whose minimum value may be read at generate
time when evaluated in the ``INTERFACE`` variant of the property of all
linked dependees.  For example, if a
property ``FOO`` appears in the list, then for each dependee, the
``INTERFACE_FOO`` property content in all of its dependencies will be
compared with each other and with the ``FOO`` property in the depender.
When reading the ``FOO`` property at generate time, the minimum value
will be returned.  If the property is not set, then it is ignored.

Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
:ref:`Compatible Interface Properties`.
IMPORTED
--------

Read-only indication of whether a target is IMPORTED.

The boolean value of this property is ``True`` for targets created with
the IMPORTED option to :command:`add_executable` or :command:`add_library`.
It is ``False`` for targets built within the project.
PUBLIC_HEADER
-------------

Specify public header files in a :prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK` shared library target.

Shared library targets marked with the :prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK` property generate
frameworks on OS X, iOS and normal shared libraries on other platforms.
This property may be set to a list of header files to be placed in the
``Headers`` directory inside the framework folder.  On non-Apple platforms
these headers may be installed using the ``PUBLIC_HEADER`` option to the
``install(TARGETS)`` command.
IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_<CONFIG>
---------------------------------------------

<CONFIG>-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY.

If set, this property completely overrides the generic property for
the named configuration.
VS_SDK_REFERENCES
-----------------

Visual Studio project SDK references.
Specify a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of SDK references
to be added to a generated Visual Studio project, e.g.
``Microsoft.AdMediatorWindows81, Version=1.0``.
IMPORTED_IMPLIB_<CONFIG>
------------------------

<CONFIG>-specific version of IMPORTED_IMPLIB property.

Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
EXPORT_PROPERTIES
-----------------

List additional properties to export for a target.

This property contains a list of property names that should be exported by
the :command:`install(EXPORT)` and :command:`export` commands.  By default
only a limited number of properties are exported. This property can be used
to additionally export other properties as well.

Properties starting with ``INTERFACE_`` or ``IMPORTED_`` are not allowed as
they are reserved for internal CMake use.

Properties containing generator expressions are also not allowed.
LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME
-------------------

.. |XXX| replace:: :ref:`LIBRARY <Library Output Artifacts>`
.. |xxx| replace:: library
.. include:: XXX_OUTPUT_NAME.txt

See also the :prop_tgt:`LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>` target property.
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
-------------------

List of preprocessor include file search directories.

This property specifies the list of directories given so far to the
:command:`target_include_directories` command.  In addition to accepting
values from that command, values may be set directly on any
target using the :command:`set_property` command.  A target gets its
initial value for this property from the value of the
:prop_dir:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` directory property.  Both directory and
target property values are adjusted by calls to the
:command:`include_directories` command.

The value of this property is used by the generators to set the include
paths for the compiler.

Relative paths should not be added to this property directly. Use one of
the commands above instead to handle relative paths.

Contents of ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
manual for available expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)`
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
ANDROID_STL_TYPE
----------------

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android with NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual Studio
Edition`, this property specifies the type of STL support for the project.
This is a string property that could set to the one of the following values:

``none``
  No C++ Support
``system``
  Minimal C++ without STL
``gabi++_static``
  GAbi++ Static
``gabi++_shared``
  GAbi++ Shared
``gnustl_static``
  GNU libstdc++ Static
``gnustl_shared``
  GNU libstdc++ Shared
``stlport_static``
  STLport Static
``stlport_shared``
  STLport Shared

This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_STL_TYPE` variable if it is set when a target is
created.
LINK_LIBRARIES
--------------

List of direct link dependencies.

This property specifies the list of libraries or targets which will be
used for linking.  In addition to accepting values from the
:command:`target_link_libraries` command, values may be set directly on
any target using the :command:`set_property` command.

The value of this property is used by the generators to set the link
libraries for the compiler.

Contents of ``LINK_LIBRARIES`` may use "generator expressions" with the
syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual
for available expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)` manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.
EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD
--------------------------

Exclude target from "Build Solution".

This property is only used by Visual Studio generators.
When set to TRUE, the target will not be built when you press "Build
Solution".
VS_SCC_PROVIDER
---------------

Visual Studio Source Code Control Provider.

Can be set to change the visual studio source code control provider
property.
DEBUG_POSTFIX
-------------

See target property <CONFIG>_POSTFIX.

This property is a special case of the more-general <CONFIG>_POSTFIX
property for the DEBUG configuration.
NO_SONAME
---------

Whether to set "soname" when linking a shared library.

Enable this boolean property if a generated shared library
should not have "soname" set.  Default is to set "soname" on all
shared libraries as long as the platform supports it.
Generally, use this property only for leaf private libraries or
plugins.  If you use it on normal shared libraries which other targets
link against, on some platforms a linker will insert a full path to
the library (as specified at link time) into the dynamic section of
the dependent binary.  Therefore, once installed, dynamic loader may
eventually fail to locate the library for the binary.
ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DEPENDENCIES
-------------------------------

Set the Android property that specifies the .so dependencies.
This is a string property.

This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DEPENDENCIES` variable if it is set
when a target is created.

Contents of ``ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DEPENDENCIES`` may use
"generator expressions" with the syntax ``$<...>``. See the
:manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual for
available expressions.
ANDROID_SECURE_PROPS_PATH
-------------------------

Set the Android property that states the location of the secure properties file.
This is a string property that contains the file path.
This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_SECURE_PROPS_PATH` variable
if it is set when a target is created.
BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR
---------------------------

``BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR`` is a boolean specifying whether the macOS
``install_name`` of a target in the build tree uses the directory given by
:prop_tgt:`INSTALL_NAME_DIR`.  This setting only applies to targets on macOS.

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
:variable:`CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR` if it is set when a target is
created.

If this property is not set and policy :policy:`CMP0068` is not ``NEW``, the
value of :prop_tgt:`BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH` is used in its place.
PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT
------------------

Deprecated install support.

The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are the old
way to specify CMake scripts to run before and after installing a
target.  They are used only when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is
used to install the target.  Use the INSTALL command instead.
CUDA_PTX_COMPILATION
--------------------

Compile CUDA sources to ``.ptx`` files instead of ``.obj`` files
within :ref:`Object Libraries`.

For example:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(myptx OBJECT a.cu b.cu)
  set_property(TARGET myptx PROPERTY CUDA_PTX_COMPILATION ON)
MACOSX_BUNDLE
-------------

Build an executable as an Application Bundle on OS X or iOS.

When this property is set to ``TRUE`` the executable when built on OS X
or iOS will be created as an application bundle.  This makes it
a GUI executable that can be launched from the Finder.  See the
:prop_tgt:`MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST` target property for information about
creation of the ``Info.plist`` file for the application bundle.
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
:variable:`CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE` if it is set when a target is created.
LABELS
------

Specify a list of text labels associated with a target.

Target label semantics are currently unspecified.
COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX
-------------------------------

Properties whose maximum value from the link interface will be used.

The ``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX`` property may contain a list of
properties for this target whose maximum value may be read at generate
time when evaluated in the ``INTERFACE`` variant of the property in all
linked dependees.  For example, if a property ``FOO`` appears in the list,
then for each dependee, the ``INTERFACE_FOO`` property content in all of
its dependencies will be compared with each other and with the ``FOO``
property in the depender.  When reading the ``FOO`` property at generate
time, the maximum value will be returned. If the property is not set,
then it is ignored.

Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
:ref:`Compatible Interface Properties`.
DEFINE_SYMBOL
-------------

Define a symbol when compiling this target's sources.

DEFINE_SYMBOL sets the name of the preprocessor symbol defined when
compiling sources in a shared library.  If not set here then it is set
to target_EXPORTS by default (with some substitutions if the target is
not a valid C identifier).  This is useful for headers to know whether
they are being included from inside their library or outside to
properly setup dllexport/dllimport decorations.
VS_DESKTOP_EXTENSIONS_VERSION
-----------------------------

Visual Studio Windows 10 Desktop Extensions Version

Specifies the version of the Desktop Extensions that should be included in the
target. For example ``10.0.10240.0``. If the value is not specified, the Desktop
Extensions will not be included. To use the same version of the extensions as
the Windows 10 SDK that is being used, you can use the
:variable:`CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION` variable.
INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
-----------------------------------

Whether consumers need to create a position-independent target

The ``INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` property informs consumers of
this target whether they must set their
:prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` property to ``ON``.  If this
property is set to ``ON``, then the :prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`
property on  all consumers will be set to ``ON``. Similarly, if this
property is set to ``OFF``, then the :prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`
property on all consumers will be set to ``OFF``.  If this property is
undefined, then consumers will determine their
:prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` property by other means.  Consumers
must ensure that the targets that they link to have a consistent
requirement for their ``INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` property.
XCTEST
------

This target is a XCTest CFBundle on the Mac.

This property will usually get set via the :command:`xctest_add_bundle`
macro in :module:`FindXCTest` module.

If a module library target has this property set to true it will be
built as a CFBundle when built on the Mac.  It will have the directory
structure required for a CFBundle.

This property depends on :prop_tgt:`BUNDLE` to be effective.
INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS
-------------------------

.. |property_name| replace:: compile options
.. |command_name| replace:: :command:`target_compile_options`
.. |PROPERTY_INTERFACE_NAME| replace:: ``INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS``
.. |PROPERTY_LINK| replace:: :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_OPTIONS`
.. |PROPERTY_GENEX| replace:: ``$<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS>``
.. include:: INTERFACE_BUILD_PROPERTY.txt
IMPORTED_SONAME_<CONFIG>
------------------------

<CONFIG>-specific version of IMPORTED_SONAME property.

Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
IMPORTED_OBJECTS_<CONFIG>
-------------------------

<CONFIG>-specific version of :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_OBJECTS` property.

Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
VS_DEBUGGER_COMMAND
-------------------

Sets the local debugger command for Visual Studio C++ targets.
This is defined in ``<LocalDebuggerCommand>`` in the Visual Studio
project file.

This property only works for Visual Studio 2010 and above;
it is ignored on other generators.
OUTPUT_NAME
-----------

Output name for target files.

This sets the base name for output files created for an executable or
library target.  If not set, the logical target name is used by
default during generation. The value is not set by default during
configuration.

Contents of ``OUTPUT_NAME`` and the variants listed below may use
:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.

See also the variants:

* :prop_tgt:`OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>`
* :prop_tgt:`ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>`
* :prop_tgt:`ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME`
* :prop_tgt:`LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>`
* :prop_tgt:`LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME`
* :prop_tgt:`RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>`
* :prop_tgt:`RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME`
SOVERSION
---------

What version number is this target.

For shared libraries :prop_tgt:`VERSION` and ``SOVERSION`` can be used to
specify the build version and API version respectively.  When building or
installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports
symlinks and the linker supports so-names.  If only one of both is
specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number.
``SOVERSION`` is ignored if :prop_tgt:`NO_SONAME` property is set.

Windows Versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For shared libraries and executables on Windows the :prop_tgt:`VERSION`
attribute is parsed to extract a ``<major>.<minor>`` version number.
These numbers are used as the image version of the binary.

Mach-O Versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For shared libraries and executables on Mach-O systems (e.g. OS X, iOS),
the ``SOVERSION`` property corresponds to *compatibility version* and
:prop_tgt:`VERSION` to *current version*.  See the :prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK` target
property for an example.  Versions of Mach-O binaries may be checked with the
``otool -L <binary>`` command.
COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL
-------------------------

Properties which must be compatible with their link interface

The ``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL`` property may contain a list of
properties for this target which must be consistent when evaluated as a
boolean with the ``INTERFACE`` variant of the property in all linked
dependees.  For example, if a property ``FOO`` appears in the list, then
for each dependee, the ``INTERFACE_FOO`` property content in all of its
dependencies must be consistent with each other, and with the ``FOO``
property in the depender.

Consistency in this sense has the meaning that if the property is set,
then it must have the same boolean value as all others, and if the
property is not set, then it is ignored.

Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
:ref:`Compatible Interface Properties`.
IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
---------------------------------

Transitive link interface of an IMPORTED target.

Set this to the list of libraries whose interface is included when an
IMPORTED library target is linked to another target.  The libraries
will be included on the link line for the target.  Unlike the
LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property, this property applies to all
imported target types, including STATIC libraries.  This property is
ignored for non-imported targets.

This property is ignored if the target also has a non-empty
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property.

This property is deprecated.  Use INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES instead.
<CONFIG>_POSTFIX
----------------

Postfix to append to the target file name for configuration <CONFIG>.

When building with configuration <CONFIG> the value of this property
is appended to the target file name built on disk.  For non-executable
targets, this property is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX if it is set when a target is created.  This
property is ignored on the Mac for Frameworks and App Bundles.
POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
-------------------------

Whether to create a position-independent target

The ``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` property determines whether position
independent executables or shared libraries will be created.  This
property is ``True`` by default for ``SHARED`` and ``MODULE`` library
targets and ``False`` otherwise.  This property is initialized by the value
of the :variable:`CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` variable  if it is set
when a target is created.
AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR
-----------------

Directory where :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC`, :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC`
generate files for the target.

The directory is created on demand and automatically added to the
:prop_dir:`ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES`.

When unset or empty the directory ``<dir>/<target-name>_autogen`` is used where
``<dir>`` is :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` and ``<target-name>``
is :prop_tgt:`NAME`.

By default :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR` is unset.

See the :manual:`cmake-qt(7)` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
IMPORTED_OBJECTS
----------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of absolute paths to the object
files on disk for an :ref:`imported <Imported targets>`
:ref:`object library <object libraries>`.

Ignored for non-imported targets.

Projects may skip ``IMPORTED_OBJECTS`` if the configuration-specific
property :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_OBJECTS_<CONFIG>` is set instead.
LINKER_LANGUAGE
---------------

Specifies language whose compiler will invoke the linker.

For executables, shared libraries, and modules, this sets the language
whose compiler is used to link the target (such as "C" or "CXX").  A
typical value for an executable is the language of the source file
providing the program entry point (main).  If not set, the language
with the highest linker preference value is the default.  See
documentation of CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE variables.

If this property is not set by the user, it will be calculated at
generate-time by CMake.
IMPORTED_LOCATION
-----------------

Full path to the main file on disk for an IMPORTED target.

Set this to the location of an IMPORTED target file on disk.  For
executables this is the location of the executable file.  For bundles
on OS X this is the location of the executable file inside
Contents/MacOS under the application bundle folder.  For static
libraries and modules this is the location of the library or module.
For shared libraries on non-DLL platforms this is the location of the
shared library.  For frameworks on OS X this is the location of the
library file symlink just inside the framework folder.  For DLLs this
is the location of the ".dll" part of the library.  For UNKNOWN
libraries this is the location of the file to be linked.  Ignored for
non-imported targets.

Projects may skip IMPORTED_LOCATION if the configuration-specific
property IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG> is set.  To get the location of an
imported target read one of the LOCATION or LOCATION_<CONFIG>
properties.
PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
--------------------

Output directory for the MS debug symbols ``.pdb`` file
generated by the linker for an executable or shared library target.

This property specifies the directory into which the MS debug symbols
will be placed by the linker. The property value may use
:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.
Multi-configuration generators append a per-configuration
subdirectory to the specified directory unless a generator expression

INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES defines the link interface.

CMake 2.8.11 constructed the 'link interface' of a target from
properties matching ``(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_<CONFIG>)?``.
The modern way to specify config-sensitive content is to use generator
expressions and the ``IMPORTED_`` prefix makes uniform processing of the
link interface with generator expressions impossible.  The
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES target property was introduced as a
replacement in CMake 2.8.12.  This new property is named consistently
with the INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS, INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
and INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS properties.  For in-build targets, CMake
will use the INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property as the source of the
link interface only if policy CMP0022 is NEW.  When exporting a target
which has this policy set to NEW, only the INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES
property will be processed and generated for the IMPORTED target by
default.  A new option to the install(EXPORT) and export commands
allows export of the old-style properties for compatibility with
downstream users of CMake versions older than 2.8.12.  The
target_link_libraries command will no longer populate the properties
matching LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_<CONFIG>)? if this policy is NEW.

Warning-free future-compatible code which works with CMake 2.8.7 onwards
can be written by using the ``LINK_PRIVATE`` and ``LINK_PUBLIC`` keywords
of :command:`target_link_libraries`.

The OLD behavior for this policy is to ignore the
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property for in-build targets.  The NEW
behavior for this policy is to use the INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES
property for in-build targets, and ignore the old properties matching
``(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_<CONFIG>)?``.

Honor per-config flags in :command:`try_compile` source-file signature.

The source file signature of the :command:`try_compile` command uses the value
of the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` variable in the test project so that the
test compilation works as it would in the main project.  However, CMake 3.6 and
below do not also honor config-specific compiler flags such as those in the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG` variable.  CMake 3.7 and above prefer to
honor config-specific compiler flags too.  This policy provides compatibility
for projects that do not expect config-specific compiler flags to be used.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to ignore config-specific flag
variables like :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG` and only use CMake's
built-in defaults for the current compiler and platform.

The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to honor config-specific flag
variabldes like :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG`.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.7.  Unlike most policies,

Disallow install() of export() result.

The :command:`export()` command generates a file containing
:ref:`Imported Targets`, which is suitable for use from the build

paths to buildsystem locations, and is particular to a single build
configuration.

The :command:`install(EXPORT)` generates and installs files which contain
:ref:`Imported Targets`.  These files are generated with relative paths
(unless the user specifies absolute paths), and are designed for
multi-configuration use.  See :ref:`Creating Packages` for more.

CMake 3.3 no longer allows the use of the :command:`install(FILES)` command

-------

Ninja requires custom command byproducts to be explicit.

When an intermediate file generated during the build is consumed
by an expensive operation or a large tree of dependents, one may
reduce the work needed for an incremental rebuild by updating the
file timestamp only when its content changes.  With this approach
the generation rule must have a separate output file that is always
updated with a new timestamp that is newer than any dependencies of
the rule so that the build tool re-runs the rule only when the input
changes.  We refer to the separate output file as a rule's *witness*
and the generated file as a rule's *byproduct*.

Byproducts may not be listed as outputs because their timestamps are
allowed to be older than the inputs.  No build tools (like ``make``)
that existed when CMake was designed have a way to express byproducts.
Therefore CMake versions prior to 3.2 had no way to specify them.
Projects typically left byproducts undeclared in the rules that
generate them.  For example:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_custom_command(
    OUTPUT witness.txt
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_if_different
            ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/input.txt
            byproduct.txt # timestamp may not change
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E touch witness.txt
    DEPENDS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/input.txt
    )
  add_custom_target(Provider DEPENDS witness.txt)
  add_custom_command(
    OUTPUT generated.c
    COMMAND expensive-task -i byproduct.txt -o generated.c
    DEPENDS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/byproduct.txt
    )
  add_library(Consumer generated.c)
  add_dependencies(Consumer Provider)

This works well for all generators except :generator:`Ninja`.
The Ninja build tool sees a rule listing ``byproduct.txt``
as a dependency and no rule listing it as an output.  Ninja then
complains that there is no way to satisfy the dependency and
stops building even though there are order-only dependencies
that ensure ``byproduct.txt`` will exist before its consumers
need it.  See discussion of this problem in `Ninja Issue 760`_
for further details on why Ninja works this way.

.. _`Ninja Issue 760`: https://github.com/martine/ninja/issues/760

Instead of leaving byproducts undeclared in the rules that generate
them, Ninja expects byproducts to be listed along with other outputs.
Such rules may be marked with a ``restat`` option that tells Ninja
to check the timestamps of outputs after the rules run.  This
prevents byproducts whose timestamps do not change from causing
their dependents to re-build unnecessarily.

Since the above approach does not tell CMake what custom command
generates ``byproduct.txt``, the Ninja generator does not have
enough information to add the byproduct as an output of any rule.
CMake 2.8.12 and above work around this problem and allow projects
using the above approach to build by generating ``phony`` build
rules to tell Ninja to tolerate such missing files.  However, this
workaround prevents Ninja from diagnosing a dependency that is
really missing.  It also works poorly in in-source builds where
every custom command dependency, even on source files, needs to
be treated this way because CMake does not have enough information
to know which files are generated as byproducts of custom commands.

CMake 3.2 introduced the ``BYPRODUCTS`` option to the
:command:`add_custom_command` and :command:`add_custom_target`
commands.  This option allows byproducts to be specified explicitly:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_custom_command(
    OUTPUT witness.txt
    BYPRODUCTS byproduct.txt # explicit byproduct specification
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_if_different
            ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/input.txt
            byproduct.txt # timestamp may not change
  ...

The ``BYPRODUCTS`` option is used by the :generator:`Ninja` generator
to list byproducts among the outputs of the custom commands that
generate them, and is ignored by other generators.

CMake 3.3 and above prefer to require projects to specify custom
command byproducts explicitly so that it can avoid using the
``phony`` rule workaround altogether.  Policy ``CMP0058`` was
introduced to provide compatibility with existing projects that
still need the workaround.

This policy has no effect on generators other than :generator:`Ninja`.
The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to generate Ninja ``phony``
rules for unknown dependencies in the build tree.  The ``NEW``
behavior for this policy is to not generate these and instead
require projects to specify custom command ``BYPRODUCTS`` explicitly.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.3.
CMake version |release| warns when it sees unknown dependencies in
out-of-source build trees if the policy is not set and then uses
``OLD`` behavior.  Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set
the policy to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.  The policy setting
must be in scope at the end of the top-level ``CMakeLists.txt``

Error on relative include with generator expression.

Diagnostics in CMake 2.8.12 and lower silently ignored an entry in the

expression at any position.

The path entries in that target property should not be relative. High-level
API should ensure that by adding either a source directory or a install
directory prefix, as appropriate.

As an additional diagnostic, the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` generated
on an :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` target for the install location should not contain

Plain and keyword target_link_libraries signatures cannot be mixed.

CMake 2.8.12 introduced the target_link_libraries signature using the
PUBLIC, PRIVATE, and INTERFACE keywords to generalize the LINK_PUBLIC
and LINK_PRIVATE keywords introduced in CMake 2.8.7.  Use of
signatures with any of these keywords sets the link interface of a
target explicitly, even if empty.  This produces confusing behavior
when used in combination with the historical behavior of the plain
target_link_libraries signature.  For example, consider the code:

::

 target_link_libraries(mylib A)
 target_link_libraries(mylib PRIVATE B)

After the first line the link interface has not been set explicitly so
CMake would use the link implementation, A, as the link interface.
However, the second line sets the link interface to empty.  In order
to avoid this subtle behavior CMake now prefers to disallow mixing the
plain and keyword signatures of target_link_libraries for a single
target.

The OLD behavior for this policy is to allow keyword and plain
target_link_libraries signatures to be mixed.  The NEW behavior for
this policy is to not to allow mixing of the keyword and plain
signatures.

Ignore CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS variable.

CMake 2.8.8 and lower compiled sources in SHARED and MODULE libraries
using the value of the undocumented CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS
platform variable.  The variable contained platform-specific flags
needed to compile objects for shared libraries.  Typically it included
a flag such as -fPIC for position independent code but also included
other flags needed on certain platforms.  CMake 2.8.9 and higher
prefer instead to use the POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE target property to
determine what targets should be position independent, and new
undocumented platform variables to select flags while ignoring
CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS completely.

The default for either approach produces identical compilation flags,
but if a project modifies CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS from its
original value this policy determines which approach to use.

The OLD behavior for this policy is to ignore the
POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property for all targets and use the
modified value of CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS for SHARED and
MODULE libraries.

The NEW behavior for this policy is to ignore
CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS whether it is modified or not and
honor the POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE target property.

Simplify variable reference and escape sequence evaluation.

CMake 3.1 introduced a much faster implementation of evaluation of the
:ref:`Variable References` and :ref:`Escape Sequences` documented in the
:manual:`cmake-language(7)` manual.  While the behavior is identical
to the legacy implementation in most cases, some corner cases were
cleaned up to simplify the behavior.  Specifically:

* Expansion of ``@VAR@`` reference syntax defined by the
  :command:`configure_file` and :command:`string(CONFIGURE)`
  commands is no longer performed in other contexts.

* Literal ``${VAR}`` reference syntax may contain only
  alphanumeric characters (``A-Z``, ``a-z``, ``0-9``) and
  the characters ``_``, ``.``, ``/``, ``-``, and ``+``.
  Variables with other characters in their name may still
  be referenced indirectly, e.g.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    set(varname "otherwise & disallowed $ characters")
    message("${${varname}}")

* The setting of policy :policy:`CMP0010` is not considered,
  so improper variable reference syntax is always an error.

* More characters are allowed to be escaped in variable names.
  Previously, only ``()#" \@^`` were valid characters to
  escape. Now any non-alphanumeric, non-semicolon, non-NUL
  character may be escaped following the ``escape_identity``
  production in the :ref:`Escape Sequences` section of the
  :manual:`cmake-language(7)` manual.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to honor the legacy behavior for
variable references and escape sequences.  The ``NEW`` behavior is to
use the simpler variable expansion and escape sequence evaluation rules.

Link libraries by full path even in implicit directories.

Policy :policy:`CMP0003` was introduced with the intention of always
linking library files by full path when a full path is given to the
:command:`target_link_libraries` command.  However, on some platforms
(e.g. HP-UX) the compiler front-end adds alternative library search paths
for the current architecture (e.g. ``/usr/lib/<arch>`` has alternatives
to libraries in ``/usr/lib`` for the current architecture).
On such platforms the :command:`find_library` may find a library such as
``/usr/lib/libfoo.so`` that does not belong to the current architecture.

Prior to policy :policy:`CMP0003` projects would still build in such
cases because the incorrect library path would be converted to ``-lfoo``
on the link line and the linker would find the proper library in the
arch-specific search path provided by the compiler front-end implicitly.
At the time we chose to remain compatible with such projects by always
converting library files found in implicit link directories to ``-lfoo``
flags to ask the linker to search for them.  This approach allowed existing
projects to continue to build while still linking to libraries outside
implicit link directories via full path (such as those in the build tree).

CMake does allow projects to override this behavior by using an
:ref:`IMPORTED library target <Imported Targets>` with its
:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION` property set to the desired full path to
a library file.  In fact, many :ref:`Find Modules` are learning to provide
:ref:`Imported Targets` instead of just the traditional ``Foo_LIBRARIES``
variable listing library files.  However, this makes the link line
generated for a library found by a Find Module depend on whether it
is linked through an imported target or not, which is inconsistent.
Furthermore, this behavior has been a source of confusion because the
generated link line for a library file depends on its location.  It is
also problematic for projects trying to link statically because flags
like ``-Wl,-Bstatic -lfoo -Wl,-Bdynamic`` may be used to help the linker
select ``libfoo.a`` instead of ``libfoo.so`` but then leak dynamic linking
to following libraries.  (See the :prop_tgt:`LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC`
target property for a solution typically used for that problem.)

When the special case for libraries in implicit link directories was first
introduced the list of implicit link directories was simply hard-coded
(e.g. ``/lib``, ``/usr/lib``, and a few others).  Since that time, CMake
has learned to detect the implicit link directories used by the compiler
front-end.  If necessary, the :command:`find_library` command could be
taught to use this information to help find libraries of the proper
architecture.

For these reasons, CMake 3.3 and above prefer to drop the special case
and link libraries by full path even when they are in implicit link
directories.  Policy ``CMP0060`` provides compatibility for existing
projects.

The OLD behavior for this policy is to ask the linker to search for
libraries whose full paths are known to be in implicit link directories.
The NEW behavior for this policy is to link libraries by full path even
if they are in implicit link directories.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.3.  Unlike most policies,
CMake version |release| does *not* warn by default when this policy

generate-time.  At generate time, the $<TARGET_FILE> generator
expression can be used to determine the eventual LOCATION of a target
output.

When both a legacy GL library (e.g. ``libGL.so``) and GLVND libraries

In CMake versions 2.6.4 and lower the if() command implicitly
dereferenced arguments corresponding to variables, even those named
like numbers or boolean constants, except for 0 and 1.  Numbers and
boolean constants such as true, false, yes, no, on, off, y, n,
notfound, ignore (all case insensitive) were recognized in some cases
but not all.  For example, the code "if(TRUE)" might have evaluated as
false.  Numbers such as 2 were recognized only in boolean expressions
like "if(NOT 2)" (leading to false) but not as a single-argument like
"if(2)" (also leading to false).  Later versions of CMake prefer to
treat numbers and boolean constants literally, so they should not be
used as variable names.

The OLD behavior for this policy is to implicitly dereference
variables named like numbers and boolean constants.  The NEW behavior
for this policy is to recognize numbers and boolean constants without
dereferencing variables with such names.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.0.  CMake version

the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.

Duplicate binary directories are not allowed.

CMake 2.6.3 and below silently permitted add_subdirectory() calls to
create the same binary directory multiple times.  During build system
generation files would be written and then overwritten in the build
tree and could lead to strange behavior.  CMake 2.6.4 and above
explicitly detect duplicate binary directories.  CMake 2.6.4 always
considers this case an error.  In CMake 2.8.0 and above this policy
determines whether or not the case is an error.  The OLD behavior for
this policy is to allow duplicate binary directories.  The NEW
behavior for this policy is to disallow duplicate binary directories
with an error.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.0.  CMake version

-------

:prop_tgt:`INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION` is enforced when enabled.

CMake 3.9 and newer prefer to add IPO flags whenever the
:prop_tgt:`INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION` target property is enabled and
produce an error if flags are not known to CMake for the current compiler.
Since a given compiler may not support IPO flags in all environments in which
it is used, it is now the project's responsibility to use the
:module:`CheckIPOSupported` module to check for support before enabling the
:prop_tgt:`INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION` target property.  This approach
allows a project to conditionally activate IPO when supported.  It also
allows an end user to set the :variable:`CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION`
variable in an environment known to support IPO even if the project does
not enable the property.

Since CMake 3.8 and lower only honored :prop_tgt:`INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION`
for the Intel compiler on Linux, some projects may unconditionally enable the
target property.  Policy ``CMP0069`` provides compatibility with such projects.

This policy takes effect whenever the IPO property is enabled.  The ``OLD``
behavior for this policy is to add IPO flags only for Intel compiler on Linux.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to add IPO flags for the current
compiler or produce an error if CMake does not know the flags.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.9.  CMake version
|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

Behave like CMake 3.8 and do not apply any IPO flags except for Intel compiler
on Linux:

.. code-block:: cmake

  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8)
  project(foo)

  # ...

  set_property(TARGET ... PROPERTY INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION TRUE)

Use the :module:`CheckIPOSupported` module to detect whether IPO is
supported by the current compiler, environment, and CMake version.
Produce a fatal error if support is not available:

.. code-block:: cmake

  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.9) # CMP0069 NEW
  project(foo)

  include(CheckIPOSupported)
  check_ipo_supported()

  # ...

  set_property(TARGET ... PROPERTY INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION TRUE)

Apply IPO flags only if compiler supports it:

.. code-block:: cmake

  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.9) # CMP0069 NEW
  project(foo)

  include(CheckIPOSupported)

  # ...

  check_ipo_supported(RESULT result)
  if(result)
    set_property(TARGET ... PROPERTY INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION TRUE)
  endif()

Apply IPO flags without any checks.  This may lead to build errors if IPO
is not supported by the compiler in the current environment.  Produce an
error if CMake does not know IPO flags for the current compiler:

.. code-block:: cmake

  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.9) # CMP0069 NEW
  project(foo)

  # ...

  set_property(TARGET ... PROPERTY INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION TRUE)
CMP0024
-------

Disallow include export result.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed use of the include() command with the
result of the export() command.  This relies on the assumption that
the export() command has an immediate effect at configure-time during
a cmake run.  Certain properties of targets are not fully determined
until later at generate-time, such as the link language and complete
list of link libraries.  Future refactoring will change the effect of
the export() command to be executed at generate-time.  Use ALIAS
targets instead in cases where the goal is to refer to targets by
another name.

The OLD behavior for this policy is to allow including the result of
an export() command.  The NEW behavior for this policy is not to
allow including the result of an export() command.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.  CMake version
|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use
the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.

-------

Libraries linked via full path no longer produce linker search paths.

This policy affects how libraries whose full paths are NOT known are
found at link time, but was created due to a change in how CMake deals
with libraries whose full paths are known.  Consider the code

::

  target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so)

CMake 2.4 and below implemented linking to libraries whose full paths
are known by splitting them on the link line into separate components
consisting of the linker search path and the library name.  The
example code might have produced something like

::

  ... -L/path/to -lA ...

in order to link to library A.  An analysis was performed to order
multiple link directories such that the linker would find library A in
the desired location, but there are cases in which this does not work.
CMake versions 2.6 and above use the more reliable approach of passing
the full path to libraries directly to the linker in most cases.  The
example code now produces something like

::

  ... /path/to/libA.so ....

Unfortunately this change can break code like

::

  target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)

where "B" is meant to find "/path/to/libB.so".  This code is wrong
because the user is asking the linker to find library B but has not
provided a linker search path (which may be added with the
link_directories command).  However, with the old linking
implementation the code would work accidentally because the linker
search path added for library A allowed library B to be found.

In order to support projects depending on linker search paths added by
linking to libraries with known full paths, the OLD behavior for this
policy will add the linker search paths even though they are not
needed for their own libraries.  When this policy is set to OLD, CMake
will produce a link line such as

::

  ... -L/path/to /path/to/libA.so -lB ...

which will allow library B to be found as it was previously.  When
this policy is set to NEW, CMake will produce a link line such as

::

  ... /path/to/libA.so -lB ...

which more accurately matches what the project specified.

The setting for this policy used when generating the link line is that
in effect when the target is created by an add_executable or
add_library command.  For the example described above, the code

::

  cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 OLD) # or cmake_policy(VERSION 2.4)
  add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
  target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)

will work and suppress the warning for this policy.  It may also be
updated to work with the corrected linking approach:

::

  cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 NEW) # or cmake_policy(VERSION 2.6)
  link_directories(/path/to) # needed to find library B
  add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
  target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)

Even better, library B may be specified with a full path:

::

  add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
  target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so /path/to/libB.so)

When all items on the link line have known paths CMake does not check
this policy so it has no effect.

Note that the warning for this policy will be issued for at most one
target.  This avoids flooding users with messages for every target
when setting the policy once will probably fix all targets.

when evaluating source file names:

This was undocumented behavior.

The OLD behavior for this policy is to expand such variables when processing

Targets may not link directly to themselves.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed a build target to link to itself directly with
a :command:`target_link_libraries` call. This is an indicator of a bug in

CMake 3.3 and above no longer make a list of definitions available through
the :prop_dir:`DEFINITIONS` directory property.  The
:prop_dir:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` directory property may be used instead.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to provide the list of flags given
so far to the :command:`add_definitions` command.  The ``NEW`` behavior is
to behave as a normal user-defined directory property.

Reject source and build dirs in installed INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.

CMake 3.0 and lower allowed subdirectories of the source directory or build
directory to be in the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` of
installed and exported targets, if the directory was also a subdirectory of
the installation prefix.  This makes the installation depend on the
existence of the source dir or binary dir, and the installation will be
broken if either are removed after installation.

See :ref:`Include Directories and Usage Requirements` for more on
specifying include directories for targets.

The OLD behavior for this policy is to export the content of the
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` with the source or binary
directory.  The NEW behavior for this
policy is to issue an error if such a directory is used.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.1.

-------

Do not add flags to export symbols from executables without
the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property.

CMake 3.3 and below, for historical reasons, always linked executables
on some platforms with flags like ``-rdynamic`` to export symbols from
the executables for use by any plugins they may load via ``dlopen``.
CMake 3.4 and above prefer to do this only for executables that are
explicitly marked with the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to always use the additional link
flags when linking executables regardless of the value of the
:prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property.

The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to only use the additional link
flags when linking executables if the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target
property is set to ``True``.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.4.  Unlike most policies,
CMake version |release| does *not* warn by default when this policy

:prop_tgt:`MACOSX_RPATH` is enabled by default.

CMake 2.8.12 and newer has support for using ``@rpath`` in a target's install
name.  This was enabled by setting the target property
:prop_tgt:`MACOSX_RPATH`.  The ``@rpath`` in an install name is a more
flexible and powerful mechanism than ``@executable_path`` or ``@loader_path``
for locating shared libraries.

CMake 3.0 and later prefer this property to be ON by default.  Projects
wanting ``@rpath`` in a target's install name may remove any setting of
the :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_NAME_DIR` and :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR`

Compiler id for Apple Clang is now ``AppleClang``.

CMake 3.0 and above recognize that Apple Clang is a different compiler
than upstream Clang and that they have different version numbers.
CMake now prefers to present this to projects by setting the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable to ``AppleClang`` instead
of ``Clang``.  However, existing projects may assume the compiler id for
Apple Clang is just ``Clang`` as it was in CMake versions prior to 3.0.
Therefore this policy determines for Apple Clang which compiler id to
report in the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable after
language ``<LANG>`` is enabled by the :command:`project` or
:command:`enable_language` command.  The policy must be set prior
to the invocation of either command.

property to contain relative paths.  The base path for such relative
entries is not well defined.  CMake 2.8.12 issues a FATAL_ERROR if the
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES property contains a relative path.

The OLD behavior for this policy is not to warn about relative paths
in the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES target property.  The NEW behavior for this
policy is to issue a FATAL_ERROR if INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES contains a

Libraries linked may not have leading or trailing whitespace.

CMake versions 2.4 and below silently removed leading and trailing

The OLD behavior for this policy is to silently remove leading and

Automatically link Qt executables to qtmain target on Windows.

CMake 2.8.10 and lower required users of Qt to always specify a link
dependency to the qtmain.lib static library manually on Windows.
CMake 2.8.11 gained the ability to evaluate generator expressions
while determining the link dependencies from IMPORTED targets.  This
allows CMake itself to automatically link executables which link to Qt
to the qtmain.lib library when using IMPORTED Qt targets.  For
applications already linking to qtmain.lib, this should have little
impact.  For applications which supply their own alternative WinMain
implementation and for applications which use the QAxServer library,
this automatic linking will need to be disabled as per the
documentation.

The OLD behavior for this policy is not to link executables to
qtmain.lib automatically when they link to the QtCore IMPORTED target.
The NEW behavior for this policy is to link executables to qtmain.lib
automatically when they link to QtCore IMPORTED target.

Honor visibility properties for all target types.

The :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET` and
:prop_tgt:`VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN` target properties affect visibility
of symbols during dynamic linking.  When first introduced these properties
affected compilation of sources only in shared libraries, module libraries,
and executables with the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` property set.  This
was sufficient for the basic use cases of shared libraries and executables
with plugins.  However, some sources may be compiled as part of static
libraries or object libraries and then linked into a shared library later.
CMake 3.3 and above prefer to honor these properties for sources compiled
in all target types.  This policy preserves compatibility for projects
expecting the properties to work only for some target types.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore the visibility properties
for static libraries, object libraries, and executables without exports.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to honor the visibility properties
for all target types.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.3.  CMake version

In CMake 2.4 and below the variable CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY was
used to request compatibility with earlier versions of CMake.  In

Do not re-expand variables in include and link information.

CMake 2.8.10 and lower re-evaluated values given to the

configuration step.  This was for strict compatibility with VERY early
CMake versions because all variable references are now normally
evaluated during CMake language processing.  CMake 2.8.11 and higher
prefer to skip the extra evaluation.

Ignore COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<Config> properties

CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed setting the
:prop_tgt:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>` target property and
:prop_dir:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>` directory property to apply
configuration-specific compile definitions.

Since CMake 2.8.10, the :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` property has supported
:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` for setting
configuration-dependent content.  The continued existence of the suffixed
variables is redundant, and causes a maintenance burden.  Population of the
:prop_tgt:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG <COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>>` property
may be replaced with a population of :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` directly
or via :command:`target_compile_definitions`:

.. code-block:: cmake

  # Old Interfaces:
  set_property(TARGET tgt APPEND PROPERTY
    COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG DEBUG_MODE
  )
  set_property(DIRECTORY APPEND PROPERTY
    COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG DIR_DEBUG_MODE

  )
  target_compile_definitions(tgt PRIVATE $<$<CONFIG:Debug>:DEBUG_MODE>)
  set_property(DIRECTORY APPEND PROPERTY

Since version 3.10, CMake processes **regular** and :prop_sf:`GENERATED`
source files in :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`.
In earlier CMake versions, only **regular** source files were processed.
:prop_sf:`GENERATED` source files were ignored silently.

This policy affects how source files that are :prop_sf:`GENERATED`
get treated in :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore :prop_sf:`GENERATED`
source files in :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`.

The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to process :prop_sf:`GENERATED`
source files in :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` just like regular
source files.

.. note::

  To silence the CMP0071 warning source files can be excluded from
  :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` processing by setting the

Include file check macros honor ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``.

In CMake 3.12 and above, the

* ``check_include_file`` macro in the :module:`CheckIncludeFile` module, the
* ``check_include_file_cxx`` macro in the
  :module:`CheckIncludeFileCXX` module, and the
* ``check_include_files`` macro in the :module:`CheckIncludeFiles` module

now prefer to link the check executable to the libraries listed in the
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES`` variable.  This policy provides compatibility
with projects that have not been updated to expect this behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
in the include file check macros.  The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to
honor ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES`` in the include file check macros.

Installing MACOSX_BUNDLE targets requires a BUNDLE DESTINATION.

This policy determines whether the install(TARGETS) command must be
given a BUNDLE DESTINATION when asked to install a target with the
MACOSX_BUNDLE property set.  CMake 2.4 and below did not distinguish
application bundles from normal executables when installing targets.
CMake 2.6 provides a BUNDLE option to the install(TARGETS) command
that specifies rules specific to application bundles on the Mac.
Projects should use this option when installing a target with the
MACOSX_BUNDLE property set.

The OLD behavior for this policy is to fall back to the RUNTIME
DESTINATION if a BUNDLE DESTINATION is not given.  The NEW behavior
for this policy is to produce an error if a bundle target is installed
without a BUNDLE DESTINATION.

CTest does not by default tell ``make`` to ignore errors (``-i``).

The :command:`ctest_build` and :command:`build_command` commands no
longer generate build commands for :ref:`Makefile Generators` with
the ``-i`` option.  Previously this was done to help build as much
of tested projects as possible.  However, this behavior is not
consistent with other generators and also causes the return code
of the ``make`` tool to be meaningless.

Of course users may still add this option manually by setting
:variable:`CTEST_BUILD_COMMAND` or the ``MAKECOMMAND`` cache entry.
See the :ref:`CTest Build Step` ``MakeCommand`` setting documentation
for their effects.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to add ``-i`` to ``make``
calls in CTest.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to not
add ``-i``.

Only interpret :command:`if` arguments as variables or keywords when unquoted.

CMake 3.1 and above no longer implicitly dereference variables or
interpret keywords in an :command:`if` command argument when
it is a :ref:`Quoted Argument` or a :ref:`Bracket Argument`.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to dereference variables and
interpret keywords even if they are quoted or bracketed.
The ``NEW`` behavior is to not dereference variables or interpret keywords
that have been quoted or bracketed.

Given the following partial example:

::

  set(A E)
  set(E "")

  if("${A}" STREQUAL "")
    message("Result is TRUE before CMake 3.1 or when CMP0054 is OLD")
  else()
    message("Result is FALSE in CMake 3.1 and above if CMP0054 is NEW")
  endif()

After explicit expansion of variables this gives:

::

  if("E" STREQUAL "")

With the policy set to ``OLD`` implicit expansion reduces this semantically to:

::

  if("" STREQUAL "")

With the policy set to ``NEW`` the quoted arguments will not be
further dereferenced:

::

  if("E" STREQUAL "")

List TARGET_OBJECTS in SOURCES target property.

CMake 3.0 and lower did not include the ``TARGET_OBJECTS``
:manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` when
returning the :prop_tgt:`SOURCES` target property.

Configure-time CMake code is not able to handle generator expressions.  If
using the :prop_tgt:`SOURCES` target property at configure time, it may be
necessary to first remove generator expressions using the
:command:`string(GENEX_STRIP)` command.  Generate-time CMake code such as
:command:`file(GENERATE)` can handle the content without stripping.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to omit ``TARGET_OBJECTS``
expressions from the :prop_tgt:`SOURCES` target property.  The ``NEW``
behavior for this policy is to include ``TARGET_OBJECTS`` expressions
in the output.

Libraries linked by full-path must have a valid library file name.

In CMake 2.4 and below it is possible to write code like

::

  target_link_libraries(myexe /full/path/to/somelib)

where "somelib" is supposed to be a valid library file name such as
"libsomelib.a" or "somelib.lib".  For Makefile generators this
produces an error at build time because the dependency on the full
path cannot be found.  For VS IDE and Xcode generators this used to
work by accident because CMake would always split off the library
directory and ask the linker to search for the library by name
(-lsomelib or somelib.lib).  Despite the failure with Makefiles, some
projects have code like this and build only with VS and/or Xcode.
This version of CMake prefers to pass the full path directly to the
native build tool, which will fail in this case because it does not
name a valid library file.

This policy determines what to do with full paths that do not appear
to name a valid library file.  The OLD behavior for this policy is to
split the library name from the path and ask the linker to search for
it.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to trust the given path and
pass it directly to the native build tool unchanged.

Preprocessor definition values are now escaped automatically.

This policy determines whether or not CMake should generate escaped
preprocessor definition values added via add_definitions.  CMake
versions 2.4 and below assumed that only trivial values would be given
for macros in add_definitions calls.  It did not attempt to escape
non-trivial values such as string literals in generated build rules.
CMake versions 2.6 and above support escaping of most values, but
cannot assume the user has not added escapes already in an attempt to
work around limitations in earlier versions.

The OLD behavior for this policy is to place definition values given
to add_definitions directly in the generated build rules without
attempting to escape anything.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to
generate correct escapes for all native build tools automatically.
See documentation of the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS target property for
limitations of the escaping implementation.

Honor link flags in :command:`try_compile` source-file signature.

The :command:`try_compile` command source-file signature generates a
``CMakeLists.txt`` file to build the source file into an executable.
In order to compile the source the same way as it might be compiled
by the calling project, the generated project sets the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` variable to that in the calling project.
The value of the :variable:`CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS` variable may be
needed in some cases too, but CMake 3.1 and lower did not set it in
the generated project.  CMake 3.2 and above prefer to set it so that
linker flags are honored as well as compiler flags.  This policy
provides compatibility with the pre-3.2 behavior.

The OLD behavior for this policy is to not set the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS` variable in the generated test
project.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to set the value of
the :variable:`CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS` variable in the test project
to the same as it is in the calling project.

If the project code does not set the policy explicitly, users may
set it on the command line by defining the
:variable:`CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP0056 <CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>>`
variable in the cache.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.2.  Unlike most policies,
CMake version |release| does *not* warn by default when this policy

The :command:`project` command manages VERSION variables.

CMake version 3.0 introduced the ``VERSION`` option of the :command:`project`
command to specify a project version as well as the name.  In order to keep
:variable:`PROJECT_VERSION` and related variables consistent with variable
:variable:`PROJECT_NAME` it is necessary to set the VERSION variables
to the empty string when no ``VERSION`` is given to :command:`project`.
However, this can change behavior for existing projects that set VERSION
variables themselves since :command:`project` may now clear them.
This policy controls the behavior for compatibility with such projects.

The OLD behavior for this policy is to leave VERSION variables untouched.
The NEW behavior for this policy is to set VERSION as documented by the
:command:`project` command.

Logical target names must be globally unique.

Targets names created with add_executable, add_library, or
add_custom_target are logical build target names.  Logical target
names must be globally unique because:

::

  - Unique names may be referenced unambiguously both in CMake
    code and on make tool command lines.
  - Logical names are used by Xcode and VS IDE generators
    to produce meaningful project names for the targets.

The logical name of executable and library targets does not have to
correspond to the physical file names built.  Consider using the
OUTPUT_NAME target property to create two targets with the same
physical name while keeping logical names distinct.  Custom targets
must simply have globally unique names (unless one uses the global
property ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS with a Makefiles generator).

A minimum required CMake version must be specified.

CMake requires that projects specify the version of CMake to which
they have been written.  This policy has been put in place so users
trying to build the project may be told when they need to update their
CMake.  Specifying a version also helps the project build with CMake
versions newer than that specified.  Use the cmake_minimum_required
command at the top of your main CMakeLists.txt file:

::

  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION <major>.<minor>)

where "<major>.<minor>" is the version of CMake you want to support
(such as "2.6").  The command will ensure that at least the given
version of CMake is running and help newer versions be compatible with
the project.  See documentation of cmake_minimum_required for details.

Note that the command invocation must appear in the CMakeLists.txt
file itself; a call in an included file is not sufficient.  However,
the cmake_policy command may be called to set policy CMP0000 to OLD or
NEW behavior explicitly.  The OLD behavior is to silently ignore the
missing invocation.  The NEW behavior is to issue an error instead of
a warning.  An included file may set CMP0000 explicitly to affect how
this policy is enforced for the main CMakeLists.txt file.

:command:`find_package` uses ``PackageName_ROOT`` variables.

In CMake 3.12 and above the ``find_package(PackageName)`` command now searches
a prefix specified by a ``PackageName_ROOT`` CMake or environment variable.
Package roots are maintained as a stack so nested calls to all ``find_*``
commands inside find modules also search the roots as prefixes.  This policy
provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated to avoid using
``PackageName_ROOT`` variables for other purposes.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore ``PackageName_ROOT``
variables.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to use ``PackageName_ROOT``
variables.

link_directories() treats paths relative to the source dir.

In CMake 2.8.0 and lower the link_directories() command passed
relative paths unchanged to the linker.  In CMake 2.8.1 and above the
link_directories() command prefers to interpret relative paths with
respect to CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR, which is consistent with
include_directories() and other commands.  The OLD behavior for this
policy is to use relative paths verbatim in the linker command.  The
NEW behavior for this policy is to convert relative paths to absolute
paths by appending the relative path to CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR.

Prefer files from the CMake module directory when including from there.

Starting with CMake 2.8.4, if a cmake-module shipped with CMake (i.e.
located in the CMake module directory) calls include() or
find_package(), the files located in the CMake module directory are
preferred over the files in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.  This makes sure that
the modules belonging to CMake always get those files included which
they expect, and against which they were developed and tested.  In all
other cases, the files found in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH still take
precedence over the ones in the CMake module directory.  The OLD
behavior is to always prefer files from CMAKE_MODULE_PATH over files
from the CMake modules directory.

Double colon in target name means ALIAS or IMPORTED target.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed the use of targets and files with double
colons in target_link_libraries, with some buildsystem generators.

The use of double-colons is a common pattern used to namespace IMPORTED
targets and ALIAS targets.  When computing the link dependencies of a target,
the name of each dependency could either be a target, or a file on disk.
Previously, if a target was not found with a matching name, the name was
considered to refer to a file on disk.  This can lead to confusing error
messages if there is a typo in what should be a target name.

The OLD behavior for this policy is to search for targets, then files on disk,
even if the search term contains double-colons.  The NEW behavior for this
policy is to issue a FATAL_ERROR if a link dependency contains
double-colons but is not an IMPORTED target or an ALIAS target.

Included scripts do automatic cmake_policy PUSH and POP.

In CMake 2.6.2 and below, CMake Policy settings in scripts loaded by
the include() and find_package() commands would affect the includer.
Explicit invocations of cmake_policy(PUSH) and cmake_policy(POP) were
required to isolate policy changes and protect the includer.  While
some scripts intend to affect the policies of their includer, most do
not.  In CMake 2.6.3 and above, include() and find_package() by
default PUSH and POP an entry on the policy stack around an included
script, but provide a NO_POLICY_SCOPE option to disable it.  This
policy determines whether or not to imply NO_POLICY_SCOPE for
compatibility.  The OLD behavior for this policy is to imply
NO_POLICY_SCOPE for include() and find_package() commands.  The NEW
behavior for this policy is to allow the commands to do their default
cmake_policy PUSH and POP.

libraries of utility targets.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to

Use ``QCC`` compiler id for the qcc drivers on QNX.

CMake 3.0 and above recognize that the QNX qcc compiler driver is
different from the GNU compiler.
CMake now prefers to present this to projects by setting the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable to ``QCC`` instead
of ``GNU``.  However, existing projects may assume the compiler id for
QNX qcc is just ``GNU`` as it was in CMake versions prior to 3.0.
Therefore this policy determines for QNX qcc which compiler id to
report in the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable after
language ``<LANG>`` is enabled by the :command:`project` or
:command:`enable_language` command.  The policy must be set prior
to the invocation of either command.

The OLD behavior for this policy is to use the ``GNU`` compiler id
for the qcc and QCC compiler drivers. The NEW behavior for this policy
is to use the ``QCC`` compiler id for those drivers.

``RPATH`` settings on macOS do not affect ``install_name``.

CMake 3.9 and newer remove any effect the following settings may have on the
``install_name`` of a target on macOS:

* :prop_tgt:`BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH` target property
* :prop_tgt:`SKIP_BUILD_RPATH` target property
* :variable:`CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH` variable
* :variable:`CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH` variable

Previously, setting :prop_tgt:`BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH` had the effect of
setting both the ``install_name`` of a target to :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_NAME_DIR`
and the ``RPATH`` to :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_RPATH`.  In CMake 3.9, it only affects
setting of ``RPATH``.  However, if one wants :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_NAME_DIR` to
apply to the target in the build tree, one may set
:prop_tgt:`BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR`.

If :prop_tgt:`SKIP_BUILD_RPATH`, :variable:`CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH` or
:variable:`CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH` were used to strip the directory portion
of the ``install_name`` of a target, one may set ``INSTALL_NAME_DIR=""``
instead.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to use the ``RPATH`` settings for
``install_name`` on macOS.  The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to ignore
the ``RPATH`` settings for ``install_name`` on macOS.

Target names should not be reserved and should match a validity pattern.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed creating targets using :command:`add_library`,
:command:`add_executable` and :command:`add_custom_target` with unrestricted
choice for the target name.  Newer cmake features such
as :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` and some
diagnostics expect target names to match a restricted pattern.

Target names may contain upper and lower case letters, numbers, the underscore
character (_), dot(.), plus(+) and minus(-).  As a special case, ALIAS
targets and IMPORTED targets may contain two consecutive colons.

Target names reserved by one or more CMake generators are not allowed.
Among others these include "all", "clean", "help", and "install".

Target names associated with optional features, such as "test" and "package",
may also be reserved.  CMake 3.10 and below always reserve them.  CMake 3.11
and above reserve them only when the corresponding feature is enabled
(e.g. by including the :module:`CTest` or :module:`CPack` modules).

The OLD behavior for this policy is to allow creating targets with
reserved names or which do not match the validity pattern.

Preferred executable for compiling ``CSharp`` language files. Will only be
used by CMake on the first configuration to determine ``CSharp`` default
compilation flags, after which the value for ``CSFLAGS`` is stored in the cache

DESTDIR
-------

On UNIX one can use the ``DESTDIR`` mechanism in order to relocate the
whole installation.  ``DESTDIR`` means DESTination DIRectory.  It is
commonly used by makefile users in order to install software at
non-default location.  It is usually invoked like this:

::

 make DESTDIR=/home/john install

which will install the concerned software using the installation
prefix, e.g.  ``/usr/local`` prepended with the ``DESTDIR`` value which
finally gives ``/home/john/usr/local``.

WARNING: ``DESTDIR`` may not be used on Windows because installation
prefix usually contains a drive letter like in ``C:/Program Files``
which cannot be prepended with some other prefix.

Preferred executable for compiling ``Fortran`` language files. Will only be used
by CMake on the first configuration to determine ``Fortran`` compiler, after

the :variable:`CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES` variable. See
:prop_tgt:`OSX_ARCHITECTURES` for more information.
RC
--

Preferred executable for compiling ``resource`` files. Will only be used by CMake
on the first configuration to determine ``resource`` compiler, after which the
value for ``RC`` is stored in the cache as

:variable:`CMAKE_ASM<DIALECT>_COMPILER <CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER>`.
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET
------------------------

Specify the minimum version of OS X on which the target binaries are
to be deployed.

The ``MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`` environment variable sets the default value for
the :variable:`CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` variable.

CMake on the first configuration to determine ``CXX`` compiler, after which the
value for ``CXX`` is stored in the cache as
:variable:`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER <CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER>`. For any configuration
run (including the first), the environment variable will be ignored if the
:variable:`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER <CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER>` variable is defined.
GENERATED
---------

Is this source file generated as part of the build or CMake process.

Tells the internal CMake engine that a source file is generated by an outside
process such as another build step, or the execution of CMake itself. This
information is then used to exempt the file from any existence or validity
checks. Generated files are created by the execution of commands such as
:command:`add_custom_command` and :command:`file(GENERATE)`.

When a generated file created by an :command:`add_custom_command` command
is explicitly listed as a source file for any target in the same
directory scope (which usually means the same ``CMakeLists.txt`` file),
CMake will automatically create a dependency to make sure the file is
generated before building that target.

Generated sources may be hidden in some IDE tools, while in others they might
be shown. For the special case of sources generated by CMake's :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC`
or :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC` functionality, the :prop_gbl:`AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP`,
:prop_gbl:`AUTOMOC_SOURCE_GROUP` and :prop_gbl:`AUTORCC_SOURCE_GROUP` target
properties may influence where the generated sources are grouped in the project's
file lists.
SYMBOLIC
--------

Is this just a name for a rule.

If SYMBOLIC (boolean) is set to true the build system will be informed
that the source file is not actually created on disk but instead used
as a symbolic name for a build rule.
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>
----------------------------

Ignored.  See CMake Policy :policy:`CMP0043`.

Per-configuration preprocessor definitions on a source file.

This is the configuration-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS.
Note that Xcode does not support per-configuration source file flags
so this property will be ignored by the Xcode generator.
AUTORCC_OPTIONS
---------------

Additional options for ``rcc`` when using :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC`

This property holds additional command line options which will be used when
``rcc`` is executed during the build via :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC`, i.e. it is equivalent to the
optional ``OPTIONS`` argument of the :module:`qt4_add_resources() <FindQt4>` macro.

By default it is empty.

The options set on the ``.qrc`` source file may override
:prop_tgt:`AUTORCC_OPTIONS` set on the target.

EXAMPLE
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cmake

  # ...
  set_property(SOURCE resources.qrc PROPERTY AUTORCC_OPTIONS "--compress;9")
  # ...
LOCATION
--------

The full path to a source file.

A read only property on a SOURCE FILE that contains the full path to
the source file.
COMPILE_OPTIONS
---------------

List of additional options to pass to the compiler.

This property holds a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options
and will be added to the list of compile flags when this
source file builds.  Use :prop_sf:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` to pass
additional preprocessor definitions and :prop_sf:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` to pass
additional include directories.

Contents of ``COMPILE_OPTIONS`` may use "generator expressions" with the
syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual
for available expressions.  However, :generator:`Xcode`
does not support per-config per-source settings, so expressions
that depend on the build configuration are not allowed with that
generator.

.. note::

  This property should be preferred over the :prop_sf:`COMPILE_FLAGS` property.
XCODE_LAST_KNOWN_FILE_TYPE
--------------------------

Set the Xcode ``lastKnownFileType`` attribute on its reference to a
source file.  CMake computes a default based on file extension but
can be told explicitly with this property.

See also :prop_sf:`XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE`, which is preferred
over this property if set.
VS_XAML_TYPE
------------

Mark a XAML source file as a different type than the default ``Page``.
The most common usage would be to set the default App.xaml file as
ApplicationDefinition.
VS_SHADER_OBJECT_FILE_NAME
--------------------------

Specifies a file name for the compiled shader object file for an ``.hlsl``
source file.  This adds the ``-Fo`` flag to the command line for the FxCompiler
tool.
VS_TOOL_OVERRIDE
----------------

Override the default Visual Studio tool that will be applied to the source file
with a new tool not based on the extension of the file.
MACOSX_PACKAGE_LOCATION
-----------------------

Place a source file inside a Application Bundle
(:prop_tgt:`MACOSX_BUNDLE`), Core Foundation Bundle (:prop_tgt:`BUNDLE`),
or Framework Bundle (:prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK`).  It is applicable for OS X
and iOS.

Executable targets with the :prop_tgt:`MACOSX_BUNDLE` property set are
built as OS X or iOS application bundles on Apple platforms.  Shared
library targets with the :prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK` property set are built as
OS X or iOS frameworks on Apple platforms.  Module library targets with
the :prop_tgt:`BUNDLE` property set are built as OS X ``CFBundle`` bundles
on Apple platforms.  Source files listed in the target with this property
set will be copied to a directory inside the bundle or framework content
folder specified by the property value.  For OS X Application Bundles the
content folder is ``<name>.app/Contents``.  For OS X Frameworks the
content folder is ``<name>.framework/Versions/<version>``.  For OS X
CFBundles the content folder is ``<name>.bundle/Contents`` (unless the
extension is changed).  See the :prop_tgt:`PUBLIC_HEADER`,
:prop_tgt:`PRIVATE_HEADER`, and :prop_tgt:`RESOURCE` target properties for
specifying files meant for ``Headers``, ``PrivateHeaders``, or
``Resources`` directories.

If the specified location is equal to ``Resources``, the resulting location
will be the same as if the :prop_tgt:`RESOURCE` property had been used. If
the specified location is a sub-folder of ``Resources``, it will be placed
into the respective sub-folder. Note: For iOS Apple uses a flat bundle layout
where no ``Resources`` folder exist. Therefore CMake strips the ``Resources``
folder name from the specified location.
VS_SHADER_ENTRYPOINT
--------------------

Specifies the name of the entry point for the shader of a ``.hlsl`` source
file.
Fortran_FORMAT
--------------

Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the Fortran source layout.

This property tells CMake whether a given Fortran source file uses
fixed-format or free-format.  CMake will pass the corresponding format
flag to the compiler.  Consider using the target-wide Fortran_FORMAT
property if all source files in a target share the same format.
LANGUAGE
--------

What programming language is the file.

A property that can be set to indicate what programming language the
source file is.  If it is not set the language is determined based on
the file extension.  Typical values are CXX C etc.  Setting this
property for a file means this file will be compiled.  Do not set this
for headers or files that should not be compiled.
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
-------------------

Preprocessor definitions for compiling a source file.

The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a semicolon-separated
list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax VAR or VAR=value.
Function-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will
automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system
(note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some
values).  This property may be set on a per-configuration basis using
the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG> where <CONFIG> is an upper-case
name (ex.  "COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG").

CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
by the native build tool.  Xcode does not support per-configuration
definitions on source files.

.. include:: /include/COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DISCLAIMER.txt

Contents of ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
manual for available expressions.  However, :generator:`Xcode`
does not support per-config per-source settings, so expressions
that depend on the build configuration are not allowed with that
generator.

Generator expressions should be preferred instead of setting the alternative per-configuration
property.
VS_SHADER_VARIABLE_NAME
-----------------------

Set name of variable in header file containing object code of a ``.hlsl``
source file.
AUTOUIC_OPTIONS
---------------

Additional options for ``uic`` when using :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`

This property holds additional command line options
which will be used when ``uic`` is executed during the build via
:prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`, i.e. it is equivalent to the optional ``OPTIONS``
argument of the :module:`qt4_wrap_ui() <FindQt4>` macro.

By default it is empty.

The options set on the ``.ui`` source file may override
:prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC_OPTIONS` set on the target.

EXAMPLE
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cmake

  # ...
  set_property(SOURCE widget.ui PROPERTY AUTOUIC_OPTIONS "--no-protection")
  # ...
VS_SHADER_OUTPUT_HEADER_FILE
----------------------------

Set filename for output header file containing object code of a ``.hlsl``
source file.
VS_SHADER_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATIONS
-------------------------------

Disable compiler optimizations for an ``.hlsl`` source file.  This adds the
``-Od`` flag to the command line for the FxCompiler tool.  Specify the value
``true`` for this property to disable compiler optimizations.
SKIP_AUTOMOC
------------

Exclude the source file from :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` processing (for Qt projects).

For broader exclusion control see :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOGEN`.

EXAMPLE
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cmake

  # ...
  set_property(SOURCE file.h PROPERTY SKIP_AUTOMOC ON)
  # ...
VS_SHADER_TYPE
--------------

Set the VS shader type of a ``.hlsl`` source file.
COMPILE_FLAGS
-------------

Additional flags to be added when compiling this source file.

The ``COMPILE_FLAGS`` property, managed as a string, sets additional compiler
flags used to build source files.  Use :prop_sf:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` to pass
additional preprocessor definitions.

Contents of ``COMPILE_FLAGS`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
manual for available expressions.  However, :generator:`Xcode`
does not support per-config per-source settings, so expressions
that depend on the build configuration are not allowed with that
generator.

.. note::

  This property has been superseded by the :prop_sf:`COMPILE_OPTIONS` property.
VS_INCLUDE_IN_VSIX
------------------

Boolean property to specify if the file should be included within a VSIX
extension package. This is needed for development of Visual Studio
extensions.
XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE
------------------------

Set the Xcode ``explicitFileType`` attribute on its reference to a
source file.  CMake computes a default based on file extension but
can be told explicitly with this property.

See also :prop_sf:`XCODE_LAST_KNOWN_FILE_TYPE`.
VS_SHADER_FLAGS
---------------

Set additional VS shader flags of a ``.hlsl`` source file.
ABSTRACT
--------

Is this source file an abstract class.

A property on a source file that indicates if the source file
represents a class that is abstract.  This only makes sense for
languages that have a notion of an abstract class and it is only used
by some tools that wrap classes into other languages.
OBJECT_DEPENDS
--------------

Additional files on which a compiled object file depends.

Specifies a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of full-paths to
files on which any object files compiled from this source file depend.
On :ref:`Makefile Generators` and the :generator:`Ninja` generator an
object file will be recompiled if any of the named files is newer than it.
:ref:`Visual Studio Generators` and the :generator:`Xcode` generator
cannot implement such compilation dependencies.

This property need not be used to specify the dependency of a source
file on a generated header file that it includes.  Although the
property was originally introduced for this purpose, it is no longer
necessary.  If the generated header file is created by a custom
command in the same target as the source file, the automatic
dependency scanning process will recognize the dependency.  If the
generated header file is created by another target, an inter-target
dependency should be created with the :command:`add_dependencies`
command (if one does not already exist due to linking relationships).
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
-------------------

List of preprocessor include file search directories.

This property holds a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of paths
and will be added to the list of include directories when this
source file builds. These directories will take precedence over directories
defined at target level except for :generator:`Xcode` generator due to technical
limitations.

Relative paths should not be added to this property directly.

Contents of ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual
for available expressions.  However, :generator:`Xcode` does not support
per-config per-source settings, so expressions that depend on the build
configuration are not allowed with that generator.
XCODE_FILE_ATTRIBUTES
---------------------

Add values to the Xcode ``ATTRIBUTES`` setting on its reference to a
source file.  Among other things, this can be used to set the role on
a mig file::

  set_source_files_properties(defs.mig
      PROPERTIES
          XCODE_FILE_ATTRIBUTES "Client;Server"
  )
VS_COPY_TO_OUT_DIR
------------------

Sets the ``<CopyToOutputDirectory>`` tag for a source file in a
Visual Studio project file. Valid values are ``Never``, ``Always``
and ``PreserveNewest``.
WRAP_EXCLUDE
------------

Exclude this source file from any code wrapping techniques.

Some packages can wrap source files into alternate languages to
provide additional functionality.  For example, C++ code can be
wrapped into Java or Python etc using SWIG etc.  If WRAP_EXCLUDE is
set to true (1 etc) that indicates that this source file should not be
wrapped.
VS_DEPLOYMENT_CONTENT
---------------------

Mark a source file as content for deployment with a Windows Phone or
Windows Store application when built with a Visual Studio generator.
The value must evaluate to either ``1`` or ``0`` and may use
:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
to make the choice based on the build configuration.
The ``.vcxproj`` file entry for the source file will be
marked either ``DeploymentContent`` or ``ExcludedFromBuild``
for values ``1`` and ``0``, respectively.
SKIP_AUTOGEN
------------

Exclude the source file from :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC`, :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` and
:prop_tgt:`AUTORCC` processing (for Qt projects).

For finer exclusion control see :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOMOC`,
:prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOUIC` and :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTORCC`.

EXAMPLE
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cmake

  # ...
  set_property(SOURCE file.h PROPERTY SKIP_AUTOGEN ON)
  # ...
LABELS
------

Specify a list of text labels associated with a source file.

This property has meaning only when the source file is listed in a
target whose LABELS property is also set.  No other semantics are
currently specified.
VS_CSHARP_<tagname>
-------------------

Visual Studio and CSharp source-file-specific configuration.

Tell the Visual Studio generator to set the source file tag
``<tagname>`` to a given value in the generated Visual Studio CSharp
project. Ignored on other generators and languages. This property
can be used to define dependencies between source files or set any
other Visual Studio specific parameters.

Example usage:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set_source_files_property(<filename>
           PROPERTIES
           VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon <other file>
           VS_CSHARP_SubType "Form")
VS_RESOURCE_GENERATOR
---------------------

This property allows to specify the resource generator to be used
on this file. It defaults to ``PublicResXFileCodeGenerator`` if
not set.

This property only applies to C# projects.
SKIP_AUTORCC
------------

Exclude the source file from :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC` processing (for Qt projects).

For broader exclusion control see :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOGEN`.

EXAMPLE
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cmake

  # ...
  set_property(SOURCE file.qrc PROPERTY SKIP_AUTORCC ON)
  # ...
EXTERNAL_OBJECT
---------------

If set to true then this is an object file.

If this property is set to true then the source file is really an
object file and should not be compiled.  It will still be linked into
the target though.
VS_SHADER_MODEL
---------------

Specifies the shader model of a ``.hlsl`` source file. Some shader types can
only be used with recent shader models
KEEP_EXTENSION
--------------

Make the output file have the same extension as the source file.

If this property is set then the file extension of the output file
will be the same as that of the source file.  Normally the output file
extension is computed based on the language of the source file, for
example .cxx will go to a .o extension.
HEADER_FILE_ONLY
----------------

Is this source file only a header file.

A property on a source file that indicates if the source file is a
header file with no associated implementation.  This is set
automatically based on the file extension and is used by CMake to
determine if certain dependency information should be computed.

By setting this property to ``ON``, you can disable compilation of
the given source file, even if it should be compiled because it is
part of the library's/executable's sources.

This is useful if you have some source files which you somehow
pre-process, and then add these pre-processed sources via
:command:`add_library` or :command:`add_executable`. Normally, in IDE,
there would be no reference of the original sources, only of these
pre-processed sources. So by setting this property for all the original
source files to ``ON``, and then either calling :command:`add_library`
or :command:`add_executable` while passing both the pre-processed
sources and the original sources, or by using :command:`target_sources`
to add original source files will do exactly what would one expect, i.e.
the original source files would be visible in IDE, and will not be built.
SKIP_AUTOUIC
------------

Exclude the source file from :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` processing (for Qt projects).

:prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOUIC` can be set on C++ header and source files and on
``.ui`` files.

For broader exclusion control see :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOGEN`.

EXAMPLE
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cmake

  # ...
  set_property(SOURCE file.h PROPERTY SKIP_AUTOUIC ON)
  set_property(SOURCE file.cpp PROPERTY SKIP_AUTOUIC ON)
  set_property(SOURCE widget.ui PROPERTY SKIP_AUTOUIC ON)
  # ...
VS_SHADER_ENABLE_DEBUG
----------------------

Enable debugging information for an ``.hlsl`` source file.  This adds the
``-Zi`` flag to the command line for the FxCompiler tool.  Specify the value
``true`` to generate debugging information for the compiled shader.
OBJECT_OUTPUTS
--------------

Additional outputs for a Makefile rule.

Additional outputs created by compilation of this source file.  If any
of these outputs is missing the object will be recompiled.  This is
supported only on Makefile generators and will be ignored on other
generators.
VS_DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION
----------------------

Specifies the deployment location for a content source file with a Windows
Phone or Windows Store application when built with a Visual Studio generator.
This property is only applicable when using :prop_sf:`VS_DEPLOYMENT_CONTENT`.
The value represent the path relative to the app package and applies to all
configurations.
.. cmake-manual-description: CMake Compile Features Reference

cmake-compile-features(7)
*************************

.. only:: html

   .. contents::

Introduction
============

Project source code may depend on, or be conditional on, the availability
of certain features of the compiler.  There are three use-cases which arise:
`Compile Feature Requirements`_, `Optional Compile Features`_
and `Conditional Compilation Options`_.

While features are typically specified in programming language standards,
CMake provides a primary user interface based on granular handling of
the features, not the language standard that introduced the feature.

The :prop_gbl:`CMAKE_C_KNOWN_FEATURES` and
:prop_gbl:`CMAKE_CXX_KNOWN_FEATURES` global properties contain all the
features known to CMake, regardless of compiler support for the feature.
The :variable:`CMAKE_C_COMPILE_FEATURES` and
:variable:`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILE_FEATURES` variables contain all features
CMake knows are known to the compiler, regardless of language standard
or compile flags needed to use them.

Features known to CMake are named mostly following the same convention
as the Clang feature test macros.  The are some exceptions, such as
CMake using ``cxx_final`` and ``cxx_override`` instead of the single
``cxx_override_control`` used by Clang.

Compile Feature Requirements
============================

Compile feature requirements may be specified with the
:command:`target_compile_features` command.  For example, if a target must
be compiled with compiler support for the
:prop_gbl:`cxx_constexpr <CMAKE_CXX_KNOWN_FEATURES>` feature:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(mylib requires_constexpr.cpp)
  target_compile_features(mylib PRIVATE cxx_constexpr)

In processing the requirement for the ``cxx_constexpr`` feature,
:manual:`cmake(1)` will ensure that the in-use C++ compiler is capable
of the feature, and will add any necessary flags such as ``-std=gnu++11``
to the compile lines of C++ files in the ``mylib`` target.  A
``FATAL_ERROR`` is issued if the compiler is not capable of the
feature.

The exact compile flags and language standard are deliberately not part
of the user interface for this use-case.  CMake will compute the
appropriate compile flags to use by considering the features specified
for each target.

Such compile flags are added even if the compiler supports the
particular feature without the flag. For example, the GNU compiler
supports variadic templates (with a warning) even if ``-std=gnu++98`` is
used.  CMake adds the ``-std=gnu++11`` flag if ``cxx_variadic_templates``
is specified as a requirement.

In the above example, ``mylib`` requires ``cxx_constexpr`` when it
is built itself, but consumers of ``mylib`` are not required to use a
compiler which supports ``cxx_constexpr``.  If the interface of
``mylib`` does require the ``cxx_constexpr`` feature (or any other
known feature), that may be specified with the ``PUBLIC`` or
``INTERFACE`` signatures of :command:`target_compile_features`:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(mylib requires_constexpr.cpp)
  # cxx_constexpr is a usage-requirement
  target_compile_features(mylib PUBLIC cxx_constexpr)

  # main.cpp will be compiled with -std=gnu++11 on GNU for cxx_constexpr.
  add_executable(myexe main.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(myexe mylib)

Feature requirements are evaluated transitively by consuming the link
implementation.  See :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)` for more on
transitive behavior of build properties and usage requirements.

Requiring Language Standards
----------------------------

In projects that use a large number of commonly available features from
a particular language standard (e.g. C++ 11) one may specify a
meta-feature (e.g. ``cxx_std_11``) that requires use of a compiler mode
aware of that standard.  This is simpler than specifying all the
features individually, but does not guarantee the existence of any
particular feature.  Diagnosis of use of unsupported features will be
delayed until compile time.

For example, if C++ 11 features are used extensively in a project's
header files, then clients must use a compiler mode aware of C++ 11
or above.  This can be requested with the code:

.. code-block:: cmake

  target_compile_features(mylib PUBLIC cxx_std_11)

In this example, CMake will ensure the compiler is invoked in a mode
that is aware of C++ 11 (or above), adding flags such as
``-std=gnu++11`` if necessary.  This applies to sources within ``mylib``
as well as any dependents (that may include headers from ``mylib``).

Availability of Compiler Extensions
-----------------------------------

Because the :prop_tgt:`CXX_EXTENSIONS` target property is ``ON`` by default,
CMake uses extended variants of language dialects by default, such as
``-std=gnu++11`` instead of ``-std=c++11``.  That target property may be
set to ``OFF`` to use the non-extended variant of the dialect flag.  Note
that because most compilers enable extensions by default, this could
expose cross-platform bugs in user code or in the headers of third-party
dependencies.

Optional Compile Features
=========================

Compile features may be preferred if available, without creating a hard
requirement.  For example, a library may provides alternative
implementations depending on whether the ``cxx_variadic_templates``
feature is available:

.. code-block:: c++

  #if Foo_COMPILER_CXX_VARIADIC_TEMPLATES
  template<int I, int... Is>
  struct Interface;

  template<int I>
  struct Interface<I>
  {
    static int accumulate()
    {
      return I;
    }
  };

  template<int I, int... Is>
  struct Interface
  {
    static int accumulate()
    {
      return I + Interface<Is...>::accumulate();
    }
  };
  #else
  template<int I1, int I2 = 0, int I3 = 0, int I4 = 0>
  struct Interface
  {
    static int accumulate() { return I1 + I2 + I3 + I4; }
  };
  #endif

Such an interface depends on using the correct preprocessor defines for the
compiler features.  CMake can generate a header file containing such
defines using the :module:`WriteCompilerDetectionHeader` module.  The
module contains the ``write_compiler_detection_header`` function which
accepts parameters to control the content of the generated header file:

.. code-block:: cmake

  write_compiler_detection_header(
    FILE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/foo_compiler_detection.h"
    PREFIX Foo
    COMPILERS GNU
    FEATURES
      cxx_variadic_templates
  )

Such a header file may be used internally in the source code of a project,
and it may be installed and used in the interface of library code.

For each feature listed in ``FEATURES``, a preprocessor definition
is created in the header file, and defined to either ``1`` or ``0``.

Additionally, some features call for additional defines, such as the
``cxx_final`` and ``cxx_override`` features. Rather than being used in
``#ifdef`` code, the ``final`` keyword is abstracted by a symbol
which is defined to either ``final``, a compiler-specific equivalent, or
to empty.  That way, C++ code can be written to unconditionally use the
symbol, and compiler support determines what it is expanded to:

.. code-block:: c++

  struct Interface {
    virtual void Execute() = 0;
  };

  struct Concrete Foo_FINAL {
    void Execute() Foo_OVERRIDE;
  };

In this case, ``Foo_FINAL`` will expand to ``final`` if the
compiler supports the keyword, or to empty otherwise.

In this use-case, the CMake code will wish to enable a particular language
standard if available from the compiler. The :prop_tgt:`CXX_STANDARD`
target property variable may be set to the desired language standard
for a particular target, and the :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` may be
set to influence all following targets:

.. code-block:: cmake

  write_compiler_detection_header(
    FILE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/foo_compiler_detection.h"
    PREFIX Foo
    COMPILERS GNU
    FEATURES
      cxx_final cxx_override
  )

  # Includes foo_compiler_detection.h and uses the Foo_FINAL symbol
  # which will expand to 'final' if the compiler supports the requested
  # CXX_STANDARD.
  add_library(foo foo.cpp)
  set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 11)

  # Includes foo_compiler_detection.h and uses the Foo_FINAL symbol
  # which will expand to 'final' if the compiler supports the feature,
  # even though CXX_STANDARD is not set explicitly.  The requirement of
  # cxx_constexpr causes CMake to set CXX_STANDARD internally, which
  # affects the compile flags.
  add_library(foo_impl foo_impl.cpp)
  target_compile_features(foo_impl PRIVATE cxx_constexpr)

The ``write_compiler_detection_header`` function also creates compatibility
code for other features which have standard equivalents.  For example, the
``cxx_static_assert`` feature is emulated with a template and abstracted
via the ``<PREFIX>_STATIC_ASSERT`` and ``<PREFIX>_STATIC_ASSERT_MSG``
function-macros.

Conditional Compilation Options
===============================

Libraries may provide entirely different header files depending on
requested compiler features.

For example, a header at ``with_variadics/interface.h`` may contain:

.. code-block:: c++

  template<int I, int... Is>
  struct Interface;

  template<int I>
  struct Interface<I>
  {
    static int accumulate()
    {
      return I;
    }
  };

  template<int I, int... Is>
  struct Interface
  {
    static int accumulate()
    {
      return I + Interface<Is...>::accumulate();
    }
  };

while a header at ``no_variadics/interface.h`` may contain:

.. code-block:: c++

  template<int I1, int I2 = 0, int I3 = 0, int I4 = 0>
  struct Interface
  {
    static int accumulate() { return I1 + I2 + I3 + I4; }
  };

It would be possible to write a abstraction ``interface.h`` header
containing something like:

.. code-block:: c++

  #include "foo_compiler_detection.h"
  #if Foo_COMPILER_CXX_VARIADIC_TEMPLATES
  #include "with_variadics/interface.h"
  #else
  #include "no_variadics/interface.h"
  #endif

However this could be unmaintainable if there are many files to
abstract. What is needed is to use alternative include directories
depending on the compiler capabilities.

CMake provides a ``COMPILE_FEATURES``
:manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` to implement
such conditions.  This may be used with the build-property commands such as
:command:`target_include_directories` and :command:`target_link_libraries`
to set the appropriate :manual:`buildsystem <cmake-buildsystem(7)>`
properties:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(foo INTERFACE)
  set(with_variadics ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/with_variadics)
  set(no_variadics ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/no_variadics)
  target_include_directories(foo
    INTERFACE
      "$<$<COMPILE_FEATURES:cxx_variadic_templates>:${with_variadics}>"
      "$<$<NOT:$<COMPILE_FEATURES:cxx_variadic_templates>>:${no_variadics}>"
    )

Consuming code then simply links to the ``foo`` target as usual and uses
the feature-appropriate include directory

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_executable(consumer_with consumer_with.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(consumer_with foo)
  set_property(TARGET consumer_with CXX_STANDARD 11)

  add_executable(consumer_no consumer_no.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(consumer_no foo)

.. cmake-manual-description: CPack Command-Line Reference

cpack(1)
********

Synopsis
========

.. parsed-literal::

 cpack [<options>]

Description
===========

The ``cpack`` executable is the CMake packaging program.
CMake projects use :command:`install` commands to define the contents of
packages which can be generated in various formats by this tool.
The :module:`CPack` module greatly simplifies the creation of the input file
used by ``cpack``, allowing most aspects of the packaging configuration to be
controlled directly from the CMake project's own ``CMakeLists.txt`` files.

Options
=======

``-G <generators>``
  ``<generators>`` is a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>`
  of generator names.  ``cpack`` will iterate through this list and produce
  package(s) in that generator's format according to the details provided in
  the ``CPackConfig.cmake`` configuration file.  A generator is responsible for
  generating the required inputs for a particular package system and invoking
  that system's package creation tools.  Possible generator names are specified
  in the :manual:`Generators <cmake-generators(7)>` section of the manual and
  the ``--help`` option lists the generators supported for the target platform.
  If this option is not given, the :variable:`CPACK_GENERATOR` variable
  determines the default set of generators that will be used.

``-C <Configuration>``
  Specify the project configuration to be packaged (e.g. ``Debug``,
  ``Release``, etc.).  When the CMake project uses a multi-configuration
  generator such as Xcode or Visual Studio, this option is needed to tell
  ``cpack`` which built executables to include in the package.

``-D <var>=<value>``
  Set a CPack variable.  This will override any value set for ``<var>`` in the
  input file read by ``cpack``.

``--config <configFile>``
  Specify the configuration file read by ``cpack`` to provide the packaging
  details.  By default, ``CPackConfig.cmake`` in the current directory will
  be used.

``--verbose,-V``
  Run ``cpack`` with verbose output.  This can be used to show more details
  from the package generation tools and is suitable for project developers.

``--debug``
  Run ``cpack`` with debug output.  This option is intended mainly for the
  developers of ``cpack`` itself and is not normally needed by project
  developers.

``--trace``
  Put the underlying cmake scripts in trace mode.

``--trace-expand``
  Put the underlying cmake scripts in expanded trace mode.

``-P <packageName>``
  Override/define the value of the :variable:`CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME` variable used
  for packaging.  Any value set for this variable in the ``CPackConfig.cmake``
  file will then be ignored.

``-R <packageVersion>``
  Override/define the value of the :variable:`CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION`
  variable used for packaging.  It will override a value set in the
  ``CPackConfig.cmake`` file or one automatically computed from
  :variable:`CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR`,
  :variable:`CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR` and
  :variable:`CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH`.

``-B <packageDirectory>``
  Override/define :variable:`CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY`, which controls the
  directory where CPack will perform its packaging work.  The resultant
  package(s) will be created at this location by default and a
  ``_CPack_Packages`` subdirectory will also be created below this directory to
  use as a working area during package creation.

``--vendor <vendorName>``
  Override/define :variable:`CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR`.

.. cmake-manual-description: CMake Qt Features Reference

cmake-qt(7)
***********

.. only:: html

   .. contents::

Introduction
============

CMake can find and use Qt 4 and Qt 5 libraries.  The Qt 4 libraries are found
by the :module:`FindQt4` find-module shipped with CMake, whereas the
Qt 5 libraries are found using "Config-file Packages" shipped with Qt 5. See
:manual:`cmake-packages(7)` for more information about CMake packages, and
see `the Qt cmake manual <http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/cmake-manual.html>`_
for your Qt version.

Qt 4 and Qt 5 may be used together in the same
:manual:`CMake buildsystem <cmake-buildsystem(7)>`:

.. code-block:: cmake

  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8.0 FATAL_ERROR)

  project(Qt4And5)

  set(CMAKE_AUTOMOC ON)

  find_package(Qt5 COMPONENTS Widgets DBus REQUIRED)
  add_executable(publisher publisher.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(publisher Qt5::Widgets Qt5::DBus)

  find_package(Qt4 REQUIRED)
  add_executable(subscriber subscriber.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(subscriber Qt4::QtGui Qt4::QtDBus)

A CMake target may not link to both Qt 4 and Qt 5.  A diagnostic is issued if
this is attempted or results from transitive target dependency evaluation.

Qt Build Tools
==============

Qt relies on some bundled tools for code generation, such as ``moc`` for
meta-object code generation, ``uic`` for widget layout and population,
and ``rcc`` for virtual filesystem content generation.  These tools may be
automatically invoked by :manual:`cmake(1)` if the appropriate conditions
are met.  The automatic tool invocation may be used with both Qt 4 and Qt 5.

The tools are executed as part of a synthesized custom target generated by
CMake.  Target dependencies may be added to that custom target by adding them
to the :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS` target property.

AUTOMOC
^^^^^^^

The :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` target property controls whether :manual:`cmake(1)`
inspects the C++ files in the target to determine if they require ``moc`` to
be run, and to create rules to execute ``moc`` at the appropriate time.

If a macro from :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES` is found in a header file,
``moc`` will be run on the file.  The result will be put into a file named
according to ``moc_<basename>.cpp``.
If the macro is found in a C++ implementation
file, the moc output will be put into a file named according to
``<basename>.moc``, following the Qt conventions.  The ``<basename>.moc`` must
be included by the user in the C++ implementation file with a preprocessor
``#include``.

Included ``moc_*.cpp`` and ``*.moc`` files will be generated in the
``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/include`` directory which is
automatically added to the target's :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`.

* This differs from CMake 3.7 and below; see their documentation for details.

* For :prop_gbl:`multi configuration generators <GENERATOR_IS_MULTI_CONFIG>`,
  the include directory is ``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/include_<CONFIG>``.

* See :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR`.

Not included ``moc_<basename>.cpp`` files will be generated in custom
folders to avoid name collisions and included in a separate
``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/mocs_compilation.cpp`` file which is compiled
into the target.

* See :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR`.

The ``moc`` command line will consume the :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` and
:prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` target properties from the target it is being
invoked for, and for the appropriate build configuration.

The :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` target property may be pre-set for all
following targets by setting the :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOMOC` variable.  The
:prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS` target property may be populated to set
options to pass to ``moc``. The :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS`
variable may be populated to pre-set the options for all following targets.

Additional macro names to search for can be added to
:prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES`.

Additional ``moc`` dependency file names can be extracted from source code
by using :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS`.

Source C++ files can be excluded from :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` processing by
enabling :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOMOC` or the broader :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOGEN`.

.. _`Qt AUTOUIC`:

AUTOUIC
^^^^^^^

The :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` target property controls whether :manual:`cmake(1)`
inspects the C++ files in the target to determine if they require ``uic`` to
be run, and to create rules to execute ``uic`` at the appropriate time.

If a preprocessor ``#include`` directive is found which matches
``<path>ui_<basename>.h``, and a ``<basename>.ui`` file exists,
then ``uic`` will be executed to generate the appropriate file.
The ``<basename>.ui`` file is searched for in the following places

1. ``<source_dir>/<basename>.ui``
2. ``<source_dir>/<path><basename>.ui``
3. ``<AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS>/<basename>.ui``
4. ``<AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS>/<path><basename>.ui``

where ``<source_dir>`` is the directory of the C++ file and
:prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS` is a list of additional search paths.

The generated generated ``ui_*.h`` files are placed in the
``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/include`` directory which is
automatically added to the target's :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`.

* This differs from CMake 3.7 and below; see their documentation for details.

* For :prop_gbl:`multi configuration generators <GENERATOR_IS_MULTI_CONFIG>`,
  the include directory is ``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/include_<CONFIG>``.

* See :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR`.

The :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` target property may be pre-set for all following
targets by setting the :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOUIC` variable.  The
:prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC_OPTIONS` target property may be populated to set options
to pass to ``uic``.  The :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS` variable may be
populated to pre-set the options for all following targets.  The
:prop_sf:`AUTOUIC_OPTIONS` source file property may be set on the
``<basename>.ui`` file to set particular options for the file.  This
overrides options from the :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC_OPTIONS` target property.

A target may populate the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS` target
property with options that should be used when invoking ``uic``.  This must be
consistent with the :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC_OPTIONS` target property content of the
depender target.  The :variable:`CMAKE_DEBUG_TARGET_PROPERTIES` variable may
be used to track the origin target of such
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS`.  This means that a library which
provides an alternative translation system for Qt may specify options which
should be used when running ``uic``:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(KI18n klocalizedstring.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(KI18n Qt5::Core)

  # KI18n uses the tr2i18n() function instead of tr().  That function is
  # declared in the klocalizedstring.h header.
  set(autouic_options
    -tr tr2i18n
    -include klocalizedstring.h
  )

  set_property(TARGET KI18n APPEND PROPERTY
    INTERFACE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS ${autouic_options}
  )

A consuming project linking to the target exported from upstream automatically
uses appropriate options when ``uic`` is run by :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`, as a
result of linking with the :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` target:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(CMAKE_AUTOUIC ON)
  # Uses a libwidget.ui file:
  add_library(LibWidget libwidget.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(LibWidget
    KF5::KI18n
    Qt5::Widgets
  )

Source files can be excluded from :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` processing by
enabling :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOUIC` or the broader :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOGEN`.

.. _`Qt AUTORCC`:

AUTORCC
^^^^^^^

The :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC` target property controls whether :manual:`cmake(1)`
creates rules to execute ``rcc`` at the appropriate time on source files
which have the suffix ``.qrc``.

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_executable(myexe main.cpp resource_file.qrc)

The :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC` target property may be pre-set for all following targets
by setting the :variable:`CMAKE_AUTORCC` variable.  The
:prop_tgt:`AUTORCC_OPTIONS` target property may be populated to set options
to pass to ``rcc``.  The :variable:`CMAKE_AUTORCC_OPTIONS` variable may be
populated to pre-set the options for all following targets.  The
:prop_sf:`AUTORCC_OPTIONS` source file property may be set on the
``<name>.qrc`` file to set particular options for the file.  This
overrides options from the :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC_OPTIONS` target property.

Source files can be excluded from :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC` processing by
enabling :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTORCC` or the broader :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOGEN`.

Visual Studio Generators
========================

When using the :manual:`Visual Studio generators <cmake-generators(7)>`,
CMake uses a ``PRE_BUILD`` :command:`custom command <add_custom_command>` for
:prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`.
If the :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` processing depends on files,
a :command:`custom target <add_custom_target>` is used instead.
This happens when

- The origin target depends on :prop_sf:`GENERATED` files which aren't excluded
  from :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` by :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOMOC`,
  :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOUIC`, :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOGEN` or :policy:`CMP0071`
- :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS` lists a source file

qtmain.lib on Windows
=====================

The Qt 4 and 5 :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` targets for the QtGui libraries specify
that the qtmain.lib static library shipped with Qt will be linked by all
dependent executables which have the :prop_tgt:`WIN32_EXECUTABLE` enabled.

To disable this behavior, enable the ``Qt5_NO_LINK_QTMAIN`` target property for
Qt 5 based targets or ``QT4_NO_LINK_QTMAIN`` target property for Qt 4 based
targets.

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_executable(myexe WIN32 main.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(myexe Qt4::QtGui)

  add_executable(myexe_no_qtmain WIN32 main_no_qtmain.cpp)
  set_property(TARGET main_no_qtmain PROPERTY QT4_NO_LINK_QTMAIN ON)
  target_link_libraries(main_no_qtmain Qt4::QtGui)

********

Synopsis
========

.. parsed-literal::

 cmake [<options>] {<path-to-source> | <path-to-existing-build>}
 cmake [{-D <var>=<value>}...] -P <cmake-script-file>
 cmake --build <dir> [<options>...] [-- <build-tool-options>...]
 cmake --open <dir>
 cmake -E <command> [<options>...]
 cmake --find-package <options>...

Description
===========

The "cmake" executable is the CMake command-line interface.  It may be
used to configure projects in scripts.  Project configuration settings
may be specified on the command line with the -D option.

CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.  Projects specify
their build process with platform-independent CMake listfiles included
in each directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.
Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a
native tool on their platform.

.. _`CMake Options`:

Options
=======

.. include:: OPTIONS_BUILD.txt

``-E <command> [<options>...]``
 See `Command-Line Tool Mode`_.

``-L[A][H]``
 List non-advanced cached variables.

 List cache variables will run CMake and list all the variables from
 the CMake cache that are not marked as INTERNAL or ADVANCED.  This
 will effectively display current CMake settings, which can then be
 changed with -D option.  Changing some of the variables may result
 in more variables being created.  If A is specified, then it will
 display also advanced variables.  If H is specified, it will also
 display help for each variable.

``--build <dir>``
 See `Build Tool Mode`_.

``--open <dir>``
 Open the generated project in the associated application.  This is
 only supported by some generators.

``-N``
 View mode only.

 Only load the cache.  Do not actually run configure and generate
 steps.

``-P <file>``
 Process script mode.

 Process the given cmake file as a script written in the CMake
 language.  No configure or generate step is performed and the cache
 is not modified.  If variables are defined using -D, this must be
 done before the -P argument.

``--find-package``
 See `Find-Package Tool Mode`_.

``--graphviz=[file]``
 Generate graphviz of dependencies, see :module:`CMakeGraphVizOptions` for more.

 Generate a graphviz input file that will contain all the library and
 executable dependencies in the project.  See the documentation for
 :module:`CMakeGraphVizOptions` for more details.

``--system-information [file]``
 Dump information about this system.

 Dump a wide range of information about the current system.  If run
 from the top of a binary tree for a CMake project it will dump
 additional information such as the cache, log files etc.

``--debug-trycompile``
 Do not delete the try_compile build tree. Only useful on one try_compile at a time.

 Do not delete the files and directories created for try_compile
 calls.  This is useful in debugging failed try_compiles.  It may
 however change the results of the try-compiles as old junk from a
 previous try-compile may cause a different test to either pass or
 fail incorrectly.  This option is best used for one try-compile at a
 time, and only when debugging.

``--debug-output``
 Put cmake in a debug mode.

 Print extra information during the cmake run like stack traces with
 message(send_error ) calls.

``--trace``
 Put cmake in trace mode.

 Print a trace of all calls made and from where.

``--trace-expand``
 Put cmake in trace mode.

 Like ``--trace``, but with variables expanded.

``--trace-source=<file>``
 Put cmake in trace mode, but output only lines of a specified file.

 Multiple options are allowed.

``--warn-uninitialized``
 Warn about uninitialized values.

 Print a warning when an uninitialized variable is used.

``--warn-unused-vars``
 Warn about unused variables.

 Find variables that are declared or set, but not used.

``--no-warn-unused-cli``
 Don't warn about command line options.

 Don't find variables that are declared on the command line, but not
 used.

``--check-system-vars``
 Find problems with variable usage in system files.

 Normally, unused and uninitialized variables are searched for only
 in CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR and CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.  This flag tells CMake to
 warn about other files as well.

.. include:: OPTIONS_HELP.txt

.. _`Build Tool Mode`:

Build Tool Mode
===============

CMake provides a command-line signature to build an already-generated
project binary tree::

 cmake --build <dir> [<options>...] [-- <build-tool-options>...]

This abstracts a native build tool's command-line interface with the
following options:

``--build <dir>``
  Project binary directory to be built.  This is required and must be first.

``-j [<jobs>], --parallel [<jobs>]``
  The maximum number of concurrent processes to use when building.
  If ``<jobs>`` is omitted the native build tool's default number is used.

  The :envvar:`CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL` environment variable, if set,
  specifies a default parallel level when this option is not given.

``--target <tgt>``
  Build ``<tgt>`` instead of default targets.  May only be specified once.

``--config <cfg>``
  For multi-configuration tools, choose configuration ``<cfg>``.

``--clean-first``
  Build target ``clean`` first, then build.
  (To clean only, use ``--target clean``.)

``--use-stderr``
  Ignored.  Behavior is default in CMake >= 3.0.

``--``
  Pass remaining options to the native tool.

Run ``cmake --build`` with no options for quick help.

Command-Line Tool Mode
======================

CMake provides builtin command-line tools through the signature::

 cmake -E <command> [<options>...]

Run ``cmake -E`` or ``cmake -E help`` for a summary of commands.
Available commands are:

``capabilities``
  Report cmake capabilities in JSON format. The output is a JSON object
  with the following keys:

  ``version``
    A JSON object with version information. Keys are:

    ``string``
      The full version string as displayed by cmake ``--version``.
    ``major``
      The major version number in integer form.
    ``minor``
      The minor version number in integer form.
    ``patch``
      The patch level in integer form.
    ``suffix``
      The cmake version suffix string.
    ``isDirty``
      A bool that is set if the cmake build is from a dirty tree.

  ``generators``

    names start in ``-``.
  ``--mtime=<date>``
    Specify modification time recorded in tarball entries.
  ``--format=<format>``
    Specify the format of the archive to be created.

    ``paxr`` (restricted pax, default), and ``zip``.

``time <command> [<args>...]``
  Run command and display elapsed time.

``touch <file>``
  Touch a file.

``touch_nocreate <file>``
  Touch a file if it exists but do not create it.  If a file does
  not exist it will be silently ignored.

UNIX-specific Command-Line Tools
--------------------------------

The following ``cmake -E`` commands are available only on UNIX:

``create_symlink <old> <new>``
  Create a symbolic link ``<new>`` naming ``<old>``.

.. note::
  Path to where ``<new>`` symbolic link will be created has to exist beforehand.

Windows-specific Command-Line Tools
-----------------------------------

The following ``cmake -E`` commands are available only on Windows:

``delete_regv <key>``
  Delete Windows registry value.

``env_vs8_wince <sdkname>``
  Displays a batch file which sets the environment for the provided
  Windows CE SDK installed in VS2005.

``env_vs9_wince <sdkname>``
  Displays a batch file which sets the environment for the provided
  Windows CE SDK installed in VS2008.

``write_regv <key> <value>``
  Write Windows registry value.

Find-Package Tool Mode
======================

CMake provides a helper for Makefile-based projects with the signature::

  cmake --find-package <options>...

This runs in a pkg-config like mode.

Search a package using :command:`find_package()` and print the resulting flags
to stdout.  This can be used to use cmake instead of pkg-config to find
installed libraries in plain Makefile-based projects or in autoconf-based
projects (via ``share/aclocal/cmake.m4``).

.. note::
  This mode is not well-supported due to some technical limitations.
  It is kept for compatibility but should not be used in new projects.

   .. contents::

Introduction
============

A CMake-based buildsystem is organized as a set of high-level logical
targets.  Each target corresponds to an executable or library, or
is a custom target containing custom commands.  Dependencies between the
targets are expressed in the buildsystem to determine the build order
and the rules for regeneration in response to change.

Binary Targets
==============

Executables and libraries are defined using the :command:`add_executable`
and :command:`add_library` commands.  The resulting binary files have
appropriate prefixes, suffixes and extensions for the platform targeted.
Dependencies between binary targets are expressed using the
:command:`target_link_libraries` command:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(archive archive.cpp zip.cpp lzma.cpp)
  add_executable(zipapp zipapp.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(zipapp archive)

``archive`` is defined as a static library -- an archive containing objects
compiled from ``archive.cpp``, ``zip.cpp``, and ``lzma.cpp``.  ``zipapp``
is defined as an executable formed by compiling and linking ``zipapp.cpp``.
When linking the ``zipapp`` executable, the ``archive`` static library is
linked in.

Binary Executables
------------------

The :command:`add_executable` command defines an executable target:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_executable(mytool mytool.cpp)

Commands such as :command:`add_custom_command`, which generates rules to be
run at build time can transparently use an :prop_tgt:`EXECUTABLE <TYPE>`
target as a ``COMMAND`` executable.  The buildsystem rules will ensure that
the executable is built before attempting to run the command.

Binary Library Types
--------------------

.. _`Normal Libraries`:

Normal Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the :command:`add_library` command defines a static library,
unless a type is specified.  A type may be specified when using the command:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(archive SHARED archive.cpp zip.cpp lzma.cpp)

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(archive STATIC archive.cpp zip.cpp lzma.cpp)

The :variable:`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` variable may be enabled to change the
behavior of :command:`add_library` to build shared libraries by default.

In the context of the buildsystem definition as a whole, it is largely
irrelevant whether particular libraries are ``SHARED`` or ``STATIC`` --
the commands, dependency specifications and other APIs work similarly
regardless of the library type.  The ``MODULE`` library type is
dissimilar in that it is generally not linked to -- it is not used in
the right-hand-side of the :command:`target_link_libraries` command.
It is a type which is loaded as a plugin using runtime techniques.
If the library does not export any unmanaged symbols (e.g. Windows
resource DLL, C++/CLI DLL), it is required that the library not be a
``SHARED`` library because CMake expects ``SHARED`` libraries to export
at least one symbol.

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(archive MODULE 7z.cpp)

.. _`Apple Frameworks`:

Apple Frameworks
""""""""""""""""

A ``SHARED`` library may be marked with the :prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK`
target property to create an OS X or iOS Framework Bundle.
The ``MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER`` sets ``CFBundleIdentifier`` key
and it uniquely identifies the bundle.

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(MyFramework SHARED MyFramework.cpp)
  set_target_properties(MyFramework PROPERTIES
    FRAMEWORK TRUE
    FRAMEWORK_VERSION A
    MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER org.cmake.MyFramework
  )

.. _`Object Libraries`:

Object Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``OBJECT`` library type defines a non-archival collection of object files
resulting from compiling the given source files.  The object files collection
may be used as source inputs to other targets:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(archive OBJECT archive.cpp zip.cpp lzma.cpp)

  add_library(archiveExtras STATIC $<TARGET_OBJECTS:archive> extras.cpp)

  add_executable(test_exe $<TARGET_OBJECTS:archive> test.cpp)

The link (or archiving) step of those other targets will use the object
files collection in addition to those from their own sources.

Alternatively, object libraries may be linked into other targets:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(archive OBJECT archive.cpp zip.cpp lzma.cpp)

  add_library(archiveExtras STATIC extras.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(archiveExtras PUBLIC archive)

  add_executable(test_exe test.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(test_exe archive)

The link (or archiving) step of those other targets will use the object
files from object libraries that are *directly* linked.  Additionally,
usage requirements of the object libraries will be honored when compiling
sources in those other targets.  Furthermore, those usage requirements
will propagate transitively to dependents of those other targets.

Object libraries may not be used as the ``TARGET`` in a use of the
:command:`add_custom_command(TARGET)` command signature.  However,
the list of objects can be used by :command:`add_custom_command(OUTPUT)`
or :command:`file(GENERATE)` by using ``$<TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib>``.

Build Specification and Usage Requirements
==========================================

The :command:`target_include_directories`, :command:`target_compile_definitions`
and :command:`target_compile_options` commands specify the build specifications
and the usage requirements of binary targets.  The commands populate the
:prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`, :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` and
:prop_tgt:`COMPILE_OPTIONS` target properties respectively, and/or the
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`, :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`
and :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS` target properties.

Each of the commands has a ``PRIVATE``, ``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` mode.  The
``PRIVATE`` mode populates only the non-``INTERFACE_`` variant of the target
property and the ``INTERFACE`` mode populates only the ``INTERFACE_`` variants.
The ``PUBLIC`` mode populates both variants of the respective target property.
Each command may be invoked with multiple uses of each keyword:

.. code-block:: cmake

  target_compile_definitions(archive
    PRIVATE BUILDING_WITH_LZMA
    INTERFACE USING_ARCHIVE_LIB
  )

Note that usage requirements are not designed as a way to make downstreams
use particular :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_OPTIONS` or
:prop_tgt:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` etc for convenience only.  The contents of
the properties must be **requirements**, not merely recommendations or
convenience.

See the :ref:`Creating Relocatable Packages` section of the
:manual:`cmake-packages(7)` manual for discussion of additional care
that must be taken when specifying usage requirements while creating
packages for redistribution.

Target Properties
-----------------

The contents of the :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`,
:prop_tgt:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` and :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_OPTIONS` target
properties are used appropriately when compiling the source files of a
binary target.

Entries in the :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` are added to the compile line
with ``-I`` or ``-isystem`` prefixes and in the order of appearance in the
property value.

Entries in the :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` are prefixed with ``-D`` or
``/D`` and added to the compile line in an unspecified order.  The
:prop_tgt:`DEFINE_SYMBOL` target property is also added as a compile
definition as a special convenience case for ``SHARED`` and ``MODULE``
library targets.

Entries in the :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_OPTIONS` are escaped for the shell and added
in the order of appearance in the property value.  Several compile options have
special separate handling, such as :prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`.

The contents of the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`,
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` and
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS` target properties are
*Usage Requirements* -- they specify content which consumers
must use to correctly compile and link with the target they appear on.
For any binary target, the contents of each ``INTERFACE_`` property on
each target specified in a :command:`target_link_libraries` command is
consumed:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(srcs archive.cpp zip.cpp)
  if (LZMA_FOUND)
    list(APPEND srcs lzma.cpp)
  endif()
  add_library(archive SHARED ${srcs})
  if (LZMA_FOUND)
    # The archive library sources are compiled with -DBUILDING_WITH_LZMA
    target_compile_definitions(archive PRIVATE BUILDING_WITH_LZMA)
  endif()
  target_compile_definitions(archive INTERFACE USING_ARCHIVE_LIB)

  add_executable(consumer)
  # Link consumer to archive and consume its usage requirements. The consumer
  # executable sources are compiled with -DUSING_ARCHIVE_LIB.
  target_link_libraries(consumer archive)

Because it is common to require that the source directory and corresponding
build directory are added to the :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`, the
:variable:`CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR` variable can be enabled to conveniently
add the corresponding directories to the :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` of
all targets.  The variable :variable:`CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE`
can be enabled to add the corresponding directories to the
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` of all targets.  This makes use of
targets in multiple different directories convenient through use of the
:command:`target_link_libraries` command.


.. _`Target Usage Requirements`:

Transitive Usage Requirements
-----------------------------

The usage requirements of a target can transitively propagate to dependents.
The :command:`target_link_libraries` command has ``PRIVATE``,
``INTERFACE`` and ``PUBLIC`` keywords to control the propagation.

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(archive archive.cpp)
  target_compile_definitions(archive INTERFACE USING_ARCHIVE_LIB)

  add_library(serialization serialization.cpp)
  target_compile_definitions(serialization INTERFACE USING_SERIALIZATION_LIB)

  add_library(archiveExtras extras.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(archiveExtras PUBLIC archive)
  target_link_libraries(archiveExtras PRIVATE serialization)
  # archiveExtras is compiled with -DUSING_ARCHIVE_LIB
  # and -DUSING_SERIALIZATION_LIB

  add_executable(consumer consumer.cpp)
  # consumer is compiled with -DUSING_ARCHIVE_LIB
  target_link_libraries(consumer archiveExtras)

Because ``archive`` is a ``PUBLIC`` dependency of ``archiveExtras``, the
usage requirements of it are propagated to ``consumer`` too.  Because
``serialization`` is a ``PRIVATE`` dependency of ``archiveExtras``, the usage
requirements of it are not propagated to ``consumer``.

Generally, a dependency should be specified in a use of
:command:`target_link_libraries` with the ``PRIVATE`` keyword if it is used by
only the implementation of a library, and not in the header files.  If a
dependency is additionally used in the header files of a library (e.g. for
class inheritance), then it should be specified as a ``PUBLIC`` dependency.
A dependency which is not used by the implementation of a library, but only by
its headers should be specified as an ``INTERFACE`` dependency.  The
:command:`target_link_libraries` command may be invoked with multiple uses of
each keyword:

.. code-block:: cmake

  target_link_libraries(archiveExtras
    PUBLIC archive
    PRIVATE serialization
  )

Usage requirements are propagated by reading the ``INTERFACE_`` variants
of target properties from dependencies and appending the values to the
non-``INTERFACE_`` variants of the operand.  For example, the
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` of dependencies is read and
appended to the :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` of the operand.  In cases
where order is relevant and maintained, and the order resulting from the
:command:`target_link_libraries` calls does not allow correct compilation,
use of an appropriate command to set the property directly may update the
order.

For example, if the linked libraries for a target must be specified
in the order ``lib1`` ``lib2`` ``lib3`` , but the include directories must
be specified in the order ``lib3`` ``lib1`` ``lib2``:

.. code-block:: cmake

  target_link_libraries(myExe lib1 lib2 lib3)
  target_include_directories(myExe
    PRIVATE $<TARGET_PROPERTY:lib3,INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>)

Note that care must be taken when specifying usage requirements for targets
which will be exported for installation using the :command:`install(EXPORT)`
command.  See :ref:`Creating Packages` for more.

.. _`Compatible Interface Properties`:

Compatible Interface Properties
-------------------------------

Some target properties are required to be compatible between a target and
the interface of each dependency.  For example, the
:prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` target property may specify a
boolean value of whether a target should be compiled as
position-independent-code, which has platform-specific consequences.
A target may also specify the usage requirement
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` to communicate that
consumers must be compiled as position-independent-code.

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
  set_property(TARGET exe1 PROPERTY POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)

  add_library(lib1 SHARED lib1.cpp)
  set_property(TARGET lib1 PROPERTY INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)

  add_executable(exe2 exe2.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(exe2 lib1)

Here, both ``exe1`` and ``exe2`` will be compiled as position-independent-code.
``lib1`` will also be compiled as position-independent-code because that is the
default setting for ``SHARED`` libraries.  If dependencies have conflicting,
non-compatible requirements :manual:`cmake(1)` issues a diagnostic:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(lib1 SHARED lib1.cpp)
  set_property(TARGET lib1 PROPERTY INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)

  add_library(lib2 SHARED lib2.cpp)
  set_property(TARGET lib2 PROPERTY INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE OFF)

  add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(exe1 lib1)
  set_property(TARGET exe1 PROPERTY POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE OFF)

  add_executable(exe2 exe2.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(exe2 lib1 lib2)

The ``lib1`` requirement ``INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` is not
"compatible" with the ``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` property of the ``exe1``
target.  The library requires that consumers are built as
position-independent-code, while the executable specifies to not built as
position-independent-code, so a diagnostic is issued.

The ``lib1`` and ``lib2`` requirements are not "compatible".  One of them
requires that consumers are built as position-independent-code, while
the other requires that consumers are not built as position-independent-code.
Because ``exe2`` links to both and they are in conflict, a diagnostic is
issued.

To be "compatible", the :prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` property,
if set must be either the same, in a boolean sense, as the
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` property of all transitively
specified dependencies on which that property is set.

This property of "compatible interface requirement" may be extended to other
properties by specifying the property in the content of the
:prop_tgt:`COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL` target property.  Each specified property
must be compatible between the consuming target and the corresponding property
with an ``INTERFACE_`` prefix from each dependency:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(lib1Version2 SHARED lib1_v2.cpp)
  set_property(TARGET lib1Version2 PROPERTY INTERFACE_CUSTOM_PROP ON)
  set_property(TARGET lib1Version2 APPEND PROPERTY
    COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL CUSTOM_PROP
  )

  add_library(lib1Version3 SHARED lib1_v3.cpp)
  set_property(TARGET lib1Version3 PROPERTY INTERFACE_CUSTOM_PROP OFF)

  add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(exe1 lib1Version2) # CUSTOM_PROP will be ON

  add_executable(exe2 exe2.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(exe2 lib1Version2 lib1Version3) # Diagnostic

Non-boolean properties may also participate in "compatible interface"
computations.  Properties specified in the
:prop_tgt:`COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING`
property must be either unspecified or compare to the same string among
all transitively specified dependencies. This can be useful to ensure
that multiple incompatible versions of a library are not linked together
through transitive requirements of a target:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(lib1Version2 SHARED lib1_v2.cpp)
  set_property(TARGET lib1Version2 PROPERTY INTERFACE_LIB_VERSION 2)
  set_property(TARGET lib1Version2 APPEND PROPERTY
    COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING LIB_VERSION
  )

  add_library(lib1Version3 SHARED lib1_v3.cpp)
  set_property(TARGET lib1Version3 PROPERTY INTERFACE_LIB_VERSION 3)

  add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(exe1 lib1Version2) # LIB_VERSION will be "2"

  add_executable(exe2 exe2.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(exe2 lib1Version2 lib1Version3) # Diagnostic

The :prop_tgt:`COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX` target property specifies
that content will be evaluated numerically and the maximum number among all
specified will be calculated:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(lib1Version2 SHARED lib1_v2.cpp)
  set_property(TARGET lib1Version2 PROPERTY INTERFACE_CONTAINER_SIZE_REQUIRED 200)
  set_property(TARGET lib1Version2 APPEND PROPERTY
    COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX CONTAINER_SIZE_REQUIRED
  )

  add_library(lib1Version3 SHARED lib1_v3.cpp)
  set_property(TARGET lib1Version3 PROPERTY INTERFACE_CONTAINER_SIZE_REQUIRED 1000)

  add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
  # CONTAINER_SIZE_REQUIRED will be "200"
  target_link_libraries(exe1 lib1Version2)

  add_executable(exe2 exe2.cpp)
  # CONTAINER_SIZE_REQUIRED will be "1000"
  target_link_libraries(exe2 lib1Version2 lib1Version3)

Similarly, the :prop_tgt:`COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN` may be used to
calculate the numeric minimum value for a property from dependencies.

Each calculated "compatible" property value may be read in the consumer at
generate-time using generator expressions.

Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in each
compatible interface property must not intersect with the set specified in
any of the other properties.

Property Origin Debugging
-------------------------

Because build specifications can be determined by dependencies, the lack of
locality of code which creates a target and code which is responsible for
setting build specifications may make the code more difficult to reason about.
:manual:`cmake(1)` provides a debugging facility to print the origin of the
contents of properties which may be determined by dependencies.  The properties
which can be debugged are listed in the
:variable:`CMAKE_DEBUG_TARGET_PROPERTIES` variable documentation:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(CMAKE_DEBUG_TARGET_PROPERTIES
    INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
    COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
    POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
    CONTAINER_SIZE_REQUIRED
    LIB_VERSION
  )
  add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)

In the case of properties listed in :prop_tgt:`COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL` or
:prop_tgt:`COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING`, the debug output shows which target
was responsible for setting the property, and which other dependencies also
defined the property.  In the case of
:prop_tgt:`COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX` and
:prop_tgt:`COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN`, the debug output shows the
value of the property from each dependency, and whether the value determines
the new extreme.

Build Specification with Generator Expressions
----------------------------------------------

Build specifications may use
:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` containing
content which may be conditional or known only at generate-time.  For example,
the calculated "compatible" value of a property may be read with the
``TARGET_PROPERTY`` expression:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(lib1Version2 SHARED lib1_v2.cpp)
  set_property(TARGET lib1Version2 PROPERTY
    INTERFACE_CONTAINER_SIZE_REQUIRED 200)
  set_property(TARGET lib1Version2 APPEND PROPERTY
    COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX CONTAINER_SIZE_REQUIRED
  )

  add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(exe1 lib1Version2)
  target_compile_definitions(exe1 PRIVATE
      CONTAINER_SIZE=$<TARGET_PROPERTY:CONTAINER_SIZE_REQUIRED>
  )

In this case, the ``exe1`` source files will be compiled with
``-DCONTAINER_SIZE=200``.

Configuration determined build specifications may be conveniently set using
the ``CONFIG`` generator expression.

.. code-block:: cmake

  target_compile_definitions(exe1 PRIVATE
      $<$<CONFIG:Debug>:DEBUG_BUILD>
  )

The ``CONFIG`` parameter is compared case-insensitively with the configuration
being built.  In the presence of :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` targets, the content of
:prop_tgt:`MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_DEBUG <MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>>` is also
accounted for by this expression.

Some buildsystems generated by :manual:`cmake(1)` have a predetermined
build-configuration set in the :variable:`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` variable.  The
buildsystem for the IDEs such as Visual Studio and Xcode are generated
independent of the build-configuration, and the actual build configuration
is not known until build-time.  Therefore, code such as

.. code-block:: cmake

  string(TOLOWER ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE} _type)
  if (_type STREQUAL debug)
    target_compile_definitions(exe1 PRIVATE DEBUG_BUILD)
  endif()

may appear to work for ``Makefile`` based and ``Ninja`` generators, but is not
portable to IDE generators.  Additionally, the :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED`
configuration-mappings are not accounted for with code like this, so it should
be avoided.

The unary ``TARGET_PROPERTY`` generator expression and the ``TARGET_POLICY``
generator expression are evaluated with the consuming target context.  This
means that a usage requirement specification may be evaluated differently based
on the consumer:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(lib1 lib1.cpp)
  target_compile_definitions(lib1 INTERFACE
    $<$<STREQUAL:$<TARGET_PROPERTY:TYPE>,EXECUTABLE>:LIB1_WITH_EXE>
    $<$<STREQUAL:$<TARGET_PROPERTY:TYPE>,SHARED_LIBRARY>:LIB1_WITH_SHARED_LIB>
    $<$<TARGET_POLICY:CMP0041>:CONSUMER_CMP0041_NEW>
  )

  add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(exe1 lib1)

  cmake_policy(SET CMP0041 NEW)

  add_library(shared_lib shared_lib.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(shared_lib lib1)

The ``exe1`` executable will be compiled with ``-DLIB1_WITH_EXE``, while the
``shared_lib`` shared library will be compiled with ``-DLIB1_WITH_SHARED_LIB``
and ``-DCONSUMER_CMP0041_NEW``, because policy :policy:`CMP0041` is
``NEW`` at the point where the ``shared_lib`` target is created.

The ``BUILD_INTERFACE`` expression wraps requirements which are only used when
consumed from a target in the same buildsystem, or when consumed from a target
exported to the build directory using the :command:`export` command.  The
``INSTALL_INTERFACE`` expression wraps requirements which are only used when
consumed from a target which has been installed and exported with the
:command:`install(EXPORT)` command:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(ClimbingStats climbingstats.cpp)
  target_compile_definitions(ClimbingStats INTERFACE
    $<BUILD_INTERFACE:ClimbingStats_FROM_BUILD_LOCATION>
    $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:ClimbingStats_FROM_INSTALLED_LOCATION>
  )
  install(TARGETS ClimbingStats EXPORT libExport ${InstallArgs})
  install(EXPORT libExport NAMESPACE Upstream::
          DESTINATION lib/cmake/ClimbingStats)
  export(EXPORT libExport NAMESPACE Upstream::)

  add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(exe1 ClimbingStats)

In this case, the ``exe1`` executable will be compiled with
``-DClimbingStats_FROM_BUILD_LOCATION``.  The exporting commands generate
:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` targets with either the ``INSTALL_INTERFACE`` or the
``BUILD_INTERFACE`` omitted, and the ``*_INTERFACE`` marker stripped away.
A separate project consuming the ``ClimbingStats`` package would contain:

.. code-block:: cmake

  find_package(ClimbingStats REQUIRED)

  add_executable(Downstream main.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(Downstream Upstream::ClimbingStats)

Depending on whether the ``ClimbingStats`` package was used from the build
location or the install location, the ``Downstream`` target would be compiled
with either ``-DClimbingStats_FROM_BUILD_LOCATION`` or
``-DClimbingStats_FROM_INSTALL_LOCATION``.  For more about packages and
exporting see the :manual:`cmake-packages(7)` manual.

.. _`Include Directories and Usage Requirements`:

Include Directories and Usage Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Include directories require some special consideration when specified as usage
requirements and when used with generator expressions.  The
:command:`target_include_directories` command accepts both relative and
absolute include directories:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(lib1 lib1.cpp)
  target_include_directories(lib1 PRIVATE
    /absolute/path
    relative/path
  )

Relative paths are interpreted relative to the source directory where the
command appears.  Relative paths are not allowed in the
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` of :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` targets.

In cases where a non-trivial generator expression is used, the
``INSTALL_PREFIX`` expression may be used within the argument of an
``INSTALL_INTERFACE`` expression.  It is a replacement marker which
expands to the installation prefix when imported by a consuming project.

Include directories usage requirements commonly differ between the build-tree
and the install-tree.  The ``BUILD_INTERFACE`` and ``INSTALL_INTERFACE``
generator expressions can be used to describe separate usage requirements
based on the usage location.  Relative paths are allowed within the
``INSTALL_INTERFACE`` expression and are interpreted relative to the
installation prefix.  For example:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(ClimbingStats climbingstats.cpp)
  target_include_directories(ClimbingStats INTERFACE
    $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/generated>
    $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:/absolute/path>
    $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:relative/path>
    $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:$<INSTALL_PREFIX>/$<CONFIG>/generated>
  )

Two convenience APIs are provided relating to include directories usage
requirements.  The :variable:`CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE` variable
may be enabled, with an equivalent effect to:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set_property(TARGET tgt APPEND PROPERTY INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
    $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR};${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}>
  )

for each target affected.  The convenience for installed targets is
an ``INCLUDES DESTINATION`` component with the :command:`install(TARGETS)`
command:

.. code-block:: cmake

  install(TARGETS foo bar bat EXPORT tgts ${dest_args}
    INCLUDES DESTINATION include
  )
  install(EXPORT tgts ${other_args})
  install(FILES ${headers} DESTINATION include)

This is equivalent to appending ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include`` to the
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` of each of the installed
:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` targets when generated by :command:`install(EXPORT)`.

When the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` of an
:ref:`imported target <Imported targets>` is consumed, the entries in the
property are treated as ``SYSTEM`` include directories, as if they were
listed in the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` of the
dependency. This can result in omission of compiler warnings for headers
found in those directories.  This behavior for :ref:`imported targets` may
be controlled by setting the :prop_tgt:`NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED` target
property on the *consumers* of imported targets.

If a binary target is linked transitively to a Mac OX framework, the
``Headers`` directory of the framework is also treated as a usage requirement.
This has the same effect as passing the framework directory as an include
directory.

Link Libraries and Generator Expressions
----------------------------------------

Like build specifications, :prop_tgt:`link libraries <LINK_LIBRARIES>` may be
specified with generator expression conditions.  However, as consumption of
usage requirements is based on collection from linked dependencies, there is
an additional limitation that the link dependencies must form a "directed
acyclic graph".  That is, if linking to a target is dependent on the value of
a target property, that target property may not be dependent on the linked
dependencies:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(lib1 lib1.cpp)
  add_library(lib2 lib2.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(lib1 PUBLIC
    $<$<TARGET_PROPERTY:POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE>:lib2>
  )
  add_library(lib3 lib3.cpp)
  set_property(TARGET lib3 PROPERTY INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)

  add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(exe1 lib1 lib3)

As the value of the :prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` property of
the ``exe1`` target is dependent on the linked libraries (``lib3``), and the
edge of linking ``exe1`` is determined by the same
:prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` property, the dependency graph above
contains a cycle.  :manual:`cmake(1)` issues a diagnostic in this case.

.. _`Output Artifacts`:

Output Artifacts
----------------

The buildsystem targets created by the :command:`add_library` and
:command:`add_executable` commands create rules to create binary outputs.
The exact output location of the binaries can only be determined at
generate-time because it can depend on the build-configuration and the
link-language of linked dependencies etc.  ``TARGET_FILE``,
``TARGET_LINKER_FILE`` and related expressions can be used to access the
name and location of generated binaries.  These expressions do not work
for ``OBJECT`` libraries however, as there is no single file generated
by such libraries which is relevant to the expressions.

There are three kinds of output artifacts that may be build by targets
as detailed in the following sections.  Their classification differs
between DLL platforms and non-DLL platforms.  All Windows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.

.. _`Runtime Output Artifacts`:

Runtime Output Artifacts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A *runtime* output artifact of a buildsystem target may be:

* The executable file (e.g. ``.exe``) of an executable target
  created by the :command:`add_executable` command.

* On DLL platforms: the executable file (e.g. ``.dll``) of a shared
  library target created by the :command:`add_library` command
  with the ``SHARED`` option.

The :prop_tgt:`RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` and :prop_tgt:`RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME`
target properties may be used to control runtime output artifact locations
and names in the build tree.

.. _`Library Output Artifacts`:

Library Output Artifacts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A *library* output artifact of a buildsystem target may be:

* The loadable module file (e.g. ``.dll`` or ``.so``) of a module
  library target created by the :command:`add_library` command
  with the ``MODULE`` option.

* On non-DLL platforms: the shared library file (e.g. ``.so`` or ``.dylib``)
  of a shared shared library target created by the :command:`add_library`
  command with the ``SHARED`` option.

The :prop_tgt:`LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` and :prop_tgt:`LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME`
target properties may be used to control library output artifact locations
and names in the build tree.

.. _`Archive Output Artifacts`:

Archive Output Artifacts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An *archive* output artifact of a buildsystem target may be:

* The static library file (e.g. ``.lib`` or ``.a``) of a static
  library target created by the :command:`add_library` command
  with the ``STATIC`` option.

* On DLL platforms: the import library file (e.g. ``.lib``) of a shared
  library target created by the :command:`add_library` command
  with the ``SHARED`` option.  This file is only guaranteed to exist if
  the library exports at least one unmanaged symbol.

* On DLL platforms: the import library file (e.g. ``.lib``) of an
  executable target created by the :command:`add_executable` command
  when its :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property is set.

The :prop_tgt:`ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` and :prop_tgt:`ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME`
target properties may be used to control archive output artifact locations
and names in the build tree.

Directory-Scoped Commands
-------------------------

The :command:`target_include_directories`,
:command:`target_compile_definitions` and
:command:`target_compile_options` commands have an effect on only one
target at a time.  The commands :command:`add_compile_definitions`,
:command:`add_compile_options` and :command:`include_directories` have
a similar function, but operate at directory scope instead of target
scope for convenience.

Pseudo Targets
==============

Some target types do not represent outputs of the buildsystem, but only inputs
such as external dependencies, aliases or other non-build artifacts.  Pseudo
targets are not represented in the generated buildsystem.

.. _`Imported Targets`:

Imported Targets
----------------

An :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` target represents a pre-existing dependency.  Usually
such targets are defined by an upstream package and should be treated as
immutable. After declaring an :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` target one can adjust its
target properties by using the customary commands such as
:command:`target_compile_definitions`, :command:`target_include_directories`,
:command:`target_compile_options` or :command:`target_link_libraries` just like
with any other regular target.

:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` targets may have the same usage requirement properties
populated as binary targets, such as
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`,
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`,
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS`,
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`, and
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`.

The :prop_tgt:`LOCATION` may also be read from an IMPORTED target, though there
is rarely reason to do so.  Commands such as :command:`add_custom_command` can
transparently use an :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` :prop_tgt:`EXECUTABLE <TYPE>` target
as a ``COMMAND`` executable.

The scope of the definition of an :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` target is the directory
where it was defined.  It may be accessed and used from subdirectories, but
not from parent directories or sibling directories.  The scope is similar to
the scope of a cmake variable.

It is also possible to define a ``GLOBAL`` :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` target which is
accessible globally in the buildsystem.

See the :manual:`cmake-packages(7)` manual for more on creating packages
with :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` targets.

.. _`Alias Targets`:

Alias Targets
-------------

An ``ALIAS`` target is a name which may be used interchangeably with
a binary target name in read-only contexts.  A primary use-case for ``ALIAS``
targets is for example or unit test executables accompanying a library, which
may be part of the same buildsystem or built separately based on user
configuration.

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(lib1 lib1.cpp)
  install(TARGETS lib1 EXPORT lib1Export ${dest_args})
  install(EXPORT lib1Export NAMESPACE Upstream:: ${other_args})

  add_library(Upstream::lib1 ALIAS lib1)

In another directory, we can link unconditionally to the ``Upstream::lib1``
target, which may be an :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` target from a package, or an
``ALIAS`` target if built as part of the same buildsystem.

.. code-block:: cmake

  if (NOT TARGET Upstream::lib1)
    find_package(lib1 REQUIRED)
  endif()
  add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(exe1 Upstream::lib1)

``ALIAS`` targets are not mutable, installable or exportable.  They are
entirely local to the buildsystem description.  A name can be tested for
whether it is an ``ALIAS`` name by reading the :prop_tgt:`ALIASED_TARGET`
property from it:

.. code-block:: cmake

  get_target_property(_aliased Upstream::lib1 ALIASED_TARGET)
  if(_aliased)
    message(STATUS "The name Upstream::lib1 is an ALIAS for ${_aliased}.")
  endif()

.. _`Interface Libraries`:

Interface Libraries
-------------------

An ``INTERFACE`` target has no :prop_tgt:`LOCATION` and is mutable, but is
otherwise similar to an :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` target.

It may specify usage requirements such as
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`,
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`,
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS`,
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`,
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_SOURCES`,
and :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`.
Only the ``INTERFACE`` modes of the :command:`target_include_directories`,
:command:`target_compile_definitions`, :command:`target_compile_options`,
:command:`target_sources`, and :command:`target_link_libraries` commands
may be used with ``INTERFACE`` libraries.

A primary use-case for ``INTERFACE`` libraries is header-only libraries.

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(Eigen INTERFACE)
  target_include_directories(Eigen INTERFACE
    $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src>
    $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/Eigen>
  )

  add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(exe1 Eigen)

Here, the usage requirements from the ``Eigen`` target are consumed and used
when compiling, but it has no effect on linking.

Another use-case is to employ an entirely target-focussed design for usage
requirements:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(pic_on INTERFACE)
  set_property(TARGET pic_on PROPERTY INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)
  add_library(pic_off INTERFACE)
  set_property(TARGET pic_off PROPERTY INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE OFF)

  add_library(enable_rtti INTERFACE)
  target_compile_options(enable_rtti INTERFACE
    $<$<OR:$<COMPILER_ID:GNU>,$<COMPILER_ID:Clang>>:-rtti>
  )

  add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(exe1 pic_on enable_rtti)

This way, the build specification of ``exe1`` is expressed entirely as linked
targets, and the complexity of compiler-specific flags is encapsulated in an
``INTERFACE`` library target.

The properties permitted to be set on or read from an ``INTERFACE`` library
are:

* Properties matching ``INTERFACE_*``
* Built-in properties matching ``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_*``
* ``EXPORT_NAME``
* ``IMPORTED``
* ``NAME``
* Properties matching ``IMPORTED_LIBNAME_*``
* Properties matching ``MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_*``

``INTERFACE`` libraries may be installed and exported.  Any content they refer
to must be installed separately:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(Eigen INTERFACE)
  target_include_directories(Eigen INTERFACE
    $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src>
    $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/Eigen>
  )

  install(TARGETS Eigen EXPORT eigenExport)
  install(EXPORT eigenExport NAMESPACE Upstream::
    DESTINATION lib/cmake/Eigen
  )
  install(FILES
      ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/eigen.h
      ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/vector.h
      ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/matrix.h
    DESTINATION include/Eigen
  )

Introduction
============

Policies in CMake are used to preserve backward compatible behavior
across multiple releases.  When a new policy is introduced, newer CMake
versions will begin to warn about the backward compatible behavior.  It
is possible to disable the warning by explicitly requesting the OLD, or
backward compatible behavior using the :command:`cmake_policy` command.
It is also possible to request ``NEW``, or non-backward compatible behavior
for a policy, also avoiding the warning.  Each policy can also be set to
either ``NEW`` or ``OLD`` behavior explicitly on the command line with the
:variable:`CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>` variable.

A policy is a deprecation mechanism and not a reliable feature toggle.
A policy should almost never be set to ``OLD``, except to silence warnings
in an otherwise frozen or stable codebase, or temporarily as part of a
larger migration path. The ``OLD`` behavior of each policy is undesirable
and will be replaced with an error condition in a future release.

The :command:`cmake_minimum_required` command does more than report an
error if a too-old version of CMake is used to build a project.  It
also sets all policies introduced in that CMake version or earlier to
``NEW`` behavior.  To manage policies without increasing the minimum required
CMake version, the :command:`if(POLICY)` command may be used:

.. code-block:: cmake

  if(POLICY CMP0990)
    cmake_policy(SET CMP0990 NEW)
  endif()

This has the effect of using the ``NEW`` behavior with newer CMake releases which
users may be using and not issuing a compatibility warning.

The setting of a policy is confined in some cases to not propagate to the
parent scope.  For example, if the files read by the :command:`include` command
or the :command:`find_package` command contain a use of :command:`cmake_policy`,
that policy setting will not affect the caller by default.  Both commands accept
an optional ``NO_POLICY_SCOPE`` keyword to control this behavior.

The :variable:`CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION` variable may also be used
to determine whether to report an error on use of deprecated macros or
functions.

Introduction
============

A *CMake Generator* is responsible for writing the input files for
a native build system.  Exactly one of the `CMake Generators`_ must be
selected for a build tree to determine what native build system is to
be used.  Optionally one of the `Extra Generators`_ may be selected
as a variant of some of the `Command-Line Build Tool Generators`_ to
produce project files for an auxiliary IDE.

CMake Generators are platform-specific so each may be available only
on certain platforms.  The :manual:`cmake(1)` command-line tool ``--help``
output lists available generators on the current platform.  Use its ``-G``
option to specify the generator for a new build tree.
The :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` offers interactive selection of a generator
when creating a new build tree.

CMake Generators
================

Command-Line Build Tool Generators
----------------------------------

These generators support command-line build tools.  In order to use them,
one must launch CMake from a command-line prompt whose environment is
already configured for the chosen compiler and build tool.

.. _`Makefile Generators`:

Makefile Generators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   /generator/Borland Makefiles
   /generator/MSYS Makefiles
   /generator/MinGW Makefiles

   /generator/Unix Makefiles
   /generator/Watcom WMake

Ninja Generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   /generator/Ninja

IDE Build Tool Generators
-------------------------

These generators support Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
project files.  Since the IDEs configure their own environment
one may launch CMake from any environment.

.. _`Visual Studio Generators`:

Visual Studio Generators

Extra Generators
================

Some of the `CMake Generators`_ listed in the :manual:`cmake(1)`
command-line tool ``--help`` output may have variants that specify
an extra generator for an auxiliary IDE tool.  Such generator
names have the form ``<extra-generator> - <main-generator>``.
The following extra generators are known to CMake.

Introduction
============

Generator expressions are evaluated during build system generation to produce
information specific to each build configuration.

Generator expressions are allowed in the context of many target properties,
such as :prop_tgt:`LINK_LIBRARIES`, :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`,
:prop_tgt:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` and others.  They may also be used when using
commands to populate those properties, such as :command:`target_link_libraries`,
:command:`target_include_directories`, :command:`target_compile_definitions`
and others.

This means that they enable conditional linking, conditional
definitions used when compiling, and conditional include directories and
more.  The conditions may be based on the build configuration, target
properties, platform information or any other queryable information.

Logical Expressions
===================

Logical expressions are used to create conditional output.  The basic
expressions are the ``0`` and ``1`` expressions.  Because other logical
expressions evaluate to either ``0`` or ``1``, they can be composed to
create conditional output::

  $<$<CONFIG:Debug>:DEBUG_MODE>

expands to ``DEBUG_MODE`` when the ``Debug`` configuration is used, and
otherwise expands to nothing.

Available logical expressions are:

``$<BOOL:...>``
  ``1`` if the ``...`` is true, else ``0``
``$<AND:?[,?]...>``
  ``1`` if all ``?`` are ``1``, else ``0``

  The ``?`` must always be either ``0`` or ``1`` in boolean expressions.

``$<OR:?[,?]...>``
  ``0`` if all ``?`` are ``0``, else ``1``
``$<NOT:?>``
  ``0`` if ``?`` is ``1``, else ``1``
``$<IF:?,true-value...,false-value...>```
  ``true-value...`` if ``?`` is ``1``, ``false-value...`` if ``?`` is ``0``
``$<STREQUAL:a,b>``
  ``1`` if ``a`` is STREQUAL ``b``, else ``0``
``$<EQUAL:a,b>``
  ``1`` if ``a`` is EQUAL ``b`` in a numeric comparison, else ``0``
``$<IN_LIST:a,b>``
  ``1`` if ``a`` is IN_LIST ``b``, else ``0``
``$<TARGET_EXISTS:tgt>``
  ``1`` if ``tgt`` is an existed target name, else ``0``.
``$<CONFIG:cfg>``
  ``1`` if config is ``cfg``, else ``0``. This is a case-insensitive comparison.
  The mapping in :prop_tgt:`MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>` is also considered by
  this expression when it is evaluated on a property on an :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED`
  target.
``$<PLATFORM_ID:comp>``
  ``1`` if the CMake-id of the platform matches ``comp``, otherwise ``0``.
``$<C_COMPILER_ID:comp>``
  ``1`` if the CMake-id of the C compiler matches ``comp``, otherwise ``0``.
``$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:comp>``
  ``1`` if the CMake-id of the CXX compiler matches ``comp``, otherwise ``0``.
``$<VERSION_LESS:v1,v2>``
  ``1`` if ``v1`` is a version less than ``v2``, else ``0``.
``$<VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2>``
  ``1`` if ``v1`` is a version greater than ``v2``, else ``0``.
``$<VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2>``
  ``1`` if ``v1`` is the same version as ``v2``, else ``0``.
``$<VERSION_LESS_EQUAL:v1,v2>``
  ``1`` if ``v1`` is a version less than or equal to ``v2``, else ``0``.
``$<VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL:v1,v2>``
  ``1`` if ``v1`` is a version greater than or equal to ``v2``, else ``0``.
``$<C_COMPILER_VERSION:ver>``
  ``1`` if the version of the C compiler matches ``ver``, otherwise ``0``.
``$<CXX_COMPILER_VERSION:ver>``
  ``1`` if the version of the CXX compiler matches ``ver``, otherwise ``0``.
``$<TARGET_POLICY:pol>``
  ``1`` if the policy ``pol`` was NEW when the 'head' target was created,
  else ``0``.  If the policy was not set, the warning message for the policy
  will be emitted. This generator expression only works for a subset of
  policies.
``$<COMPILE_FEATURES:feature[,feature]...>``
  ``1`` if all of the ``feature`` features are available for the 'head'
  target, and ``0`` otherwise. If this expression is used while evaluating
  the link implementation of a target and if any dependency transitively
  increases the required :prop_tgt:`C_STANDARD` or :prop_tgt:`CXX_STANDARD`
  for the 'head' target, an error is reported.  See the
  :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
  compile features and a list of supported compilers.
``$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:lang>``
  ``1`` when the language used for compilation unit matches ``lang``,
  otherwise ``0``.  This expression may be used to specify compile options,
  compile definitions, and include directories for source files of a
  particular language in a target. For example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    add_executable(myapp main.cpp foo.c bar.cpp zot.cu)
    target_compile_options(myapp
      PRIVATE $<$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX>:-fno-exceptions>
    )
    target_compile_definitions(myapp
      PRIVATE $<$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX>:COMPILING_CXX>
              $<$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CUDA>:COMPILING_CUDA>
    )
    target_include_directories(myapp
      PRIVATE $<$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX>:/opt/foo/cxx_headers>
    )

  This specifies the use of the ``-fno-exceptions`` compile option,
  ``COMPILING_CXX`` compile definition, and ``cxx_headers`` include
  directory for C++ only (compiler id checks elided).  It also specifies
  a ``COMPILING_CUDA`` compile definition for CUDA.

  Note that with :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` and :generator:`Xcode` there
  is no way to represent target-wide compile definitions or include directories
  separately for ``C`` and ``CXX`` languages.
  Also, with :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` there is no way to represent
  target-wide flags separately for ``C`` and ``CXX`` languages.  Under these
  generators, expressions for both C and C++ sources will be evaluated
  using ``CXX`` if there are any C++ sources and otherwise using ``C``.
  A workaround is to create separate libraries for each source file language
  instead:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    add_library(myapp_c foo.c)
    add_library(myapp_cxx bar.cpp)
    target_compile_options(myapp_cxx PUBLIC -fno-exceptions)
    add_executable(myapp main.cpp)
    target_link_libraries(myapp myapp_c myapp_cxx)

Informational Expressions
=========================

These expressions expand to some information. The information may be used
directly, eg::

  include_directories(/usr/include/$<CXX_COMPILER_ID>/)

expands to ``/usr/include/GNU/`` or ``/usr/include/Clang/`` etc, depending on
the Id of the compiler.

These expressions may also may be combined with logical expressions::

  $<$<VERSION_LESS:$<CXX_COMPILER_VERSION>,4.2.0>:OLD_COMPILER>

expands to ``OLD_COMPILER`` if the
:variable:`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_VERSION <CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION>` is less
than 4.2.0.

Available informational expressions are:

``$<CONFIGURATION>``
  Configuration name. Deprecated. Use ``CONFIG`` instead.
``$<CONFIG>``
  Configuration name
``$<PLATFORM_ID>``
  The CMake-id of the platform.
  See also the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` variable.
``$<C_COMPILER_ID>``
  The CMake-id of the C compiler used.
  See also the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable.
``$<CXX_COMPILER_ID>``
  The CMake-id of the CXX compiler used.
  See also the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable.
``$<C_COMPILER_VERSION>``
  The version of the C compiler used.
  See also the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION` variable.
``$<CXX_COMPILER_VERSION>``
  The version of the CXX compiler used.
  See also the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION` variable.
``$<TARGET_FILE:tgt>``
  Full path to main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a) where ``tgt`` is the name of a target.
``$<TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt>``
  Name of main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a).
``$<TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt>``
  Directory of main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a).
``$<TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt>``
  File used to link (.a, .lib, .so) where ``tgt`` is the name of a target.
``$<TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt>``
  Name of file used to link (.a, .lib, .so).
``$<TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt>``
  Directory of file used to link (.a, .lib, .so).
``$<TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt>``
  File with soname (.so.3) where ``tgt`` is the name of a target.
``$<TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt>``
  Name of file with soname (.so.3).
``$<TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt>``
  Directory of with soname (.so.3).
``$<TARGET_PDB_FILE:tgt>``
  Full path to the linker generated program database file (.pdb)
  where ``tgt`` is the name of a target.

  See also the :prop_tgt:`PDB_NAME` and :prop_tgt:`PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`
  target properties and their configuration specific variants
  :prop_tgt:`PDB_NAME_<CONFIG>` and :prop_tgt:`PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`.
``$<TARGET_PDB_FILE_NAME:tgt>``
  Name of the linker generated program database file (.pdb).
``$<TARGET_PDB_FILE_DIR:tgt>``
  Directory of the linker generated program database file (.pdb).
``$<TARGET_BUNDLE_DIR:tgt>``
  Full path to the bundle directory (``my.app``, ``my.framework``, or
  ``my.bundle``) where ``tgt`` is the name of a target.
``$<TARGET_BUNDLE_CONTENT_DIR:tgt>``
  Full path to the bundle content directory where ``tgt`` is the name of a
  target. For the macOS SDK it leads to ``my.app/Contents``, ``my.framework``,
  or ``my.bundle/Contents``. For all other SDKs (e.g. iOS) it leads to
  ``my.app``, ``my.framework``, or ``my.bundle`` due to the flat bundle
  structure.
``$<TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop>``
  Value of the property ``prop`` on the target ``tgt``.

  Note that ``tgt`` is not added as a dependency of the target this
  expression is evaluated on.
``$<TARGET_PROPERTY:prop>``
  Value of the property ``prop`` on the target on which the generator
  expression is evaluated.
``$<INSTALL_PREFIX>``
  Content of the install prefix when the target is exported via
  :command:`install(EXPORT)` and empty otherwise.
``$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE>``
  The compile language of source files when evaluating compile options. See
  the unary version for notes about portability of this generator
  expression.

Output Expressions
==================

These expressions generate output, in some cases depending on an input. These
expressions may be combined with other expressions for information or logical
comparison::

  -I$<JOIN:$<TARGET_PROPERTY:INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>, -I>

generates a string of the entries in the :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` target
property with each entry preceded by ``-I``. Note that a more-complete use
in this situation would require first checking if the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
property is non-empty::

  $<$<BOOL:${prop}>:-I$<JOIN:${prop}, -I>>

where ``${prop}`` refers to a helper variable::

  set(prop "$<TARGET_PROPERTY:INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>")

Available output expressions are:

``$<0:...>``
  Empty string (ignores ``...``)
``$<1:...>``
  Content of ``...``
``$<JOIN:list,...>``
  Joins the list with the content of ``...``
``$<ANGLE-R>``
  A literal ``>``. Used to compare strings which contain a ``>`` for example.
``$<COMMA>``
  A literal ``,``. Used to compare strings which contain a ``,`` for example.
``$<SEMICOLON>``
  A literal ``;``. Used to prevent list expansion on an argument with ``;``.
``$<TARGET_NAME:...>``
  Marks ``...`` as being the name of a target.  This is required if exporting
  targets to multiple dependent export sets.  The ``...`` must be a literal
  name of a target- it may not contain generator expressions.
``$<TARGET_NAME_IF_EXISTS:...>``
  Expands to the ``...`` if the given target exists, an empty string
  otherwise.
``$<LINK_ONLY:...>``
  Content of ``...`` except when evaluated in a link interface while
  propagating :ref:`Target Usage Requirements`, in which case it is the
  empty string.
  Intended for use only in an :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` target
  property, perhaps via the :command:`target_link_libraries` command,
  to specify private link dependencies without other usage requirements.
``$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:...>``
  Content of ``...`` when the property is exported using :command:`install(EXPORT)`,
  and empty otherwise.
``$<BUILD_INTERFACE:...>``
  Content of ``...`` when the property is exported using :command:`export`, or
  when the target is used by another target in the same buildsystem. Expands to
  the empty string otherwise.
``$<LOWER_CASE:...>``
  Content of ``...`` converted to lower case.
``$<UPPER_CASE:...>``
  Content of ``...`` converted to upper case.
``$<MAKE_C_IDENTIFIER:...>``
  Content of ``...`` converted to a C identifier.  The conversion follows the
  same behavior as :command:`string(MAKE_C_IDENTIFIER)`.
``$<TARGET_OBJECTS:objLib>``
  List of objects resulting from build of ``objLib``. ``objLib`` must be an
  object of type ``OBJECT_LIBRARY``.
``$<SHELL_PATH:...>``
  Content of ``...`` converted to shell path style. For example, slashes are
  converted to backslashes in Windows shells and drive letters are converted
  to posix paths in MSYS shells. The ``...`` must be an absolute path.
``$<GENEX_EVAL:...>``
  Content of ``...`` evaluated as a generator expression in the current
  context. This enables consumption of generator expressions
  whose evaluation results itself in generator expressions.
``$<TARGET_GENEX_EVAL:tgt,...>``
  Content of ``...`` evaluated as a generator expression in the context of
  ``tgt`` target. This enables consumption of custom target properties that
  themselves contain generator expressions.

  Having the capability to evaluate generator expressions is very useful when
  you want to manage custom properties supporting generator expressions.
  For example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    add_library(foo ...)

    set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY
      CUSTOM_KEYS $<$<CONFIG:DEBUG>:FOO_EXTRA_THINGS>
    )

    add_custom_target(printFooKeys
      COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo $<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,CUSTOM_KEYS>
    )

  This naive implementation of the ``printFooKeys`` custom command is wrong
  because ``CUSTOM_KEYS`` target property is not evaluated and the content
  is passed as is (i.e. ``$<$<CONFIG:DEBUG>:FOO_EXTRA_THINGS>``).

  To have the expected result (i.e. ``FOO_EXTRA_THINGS`` if config is
  ``Debug``), it is required to evaluate the output of
  ``$<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,CUSTOM_KEYS>``:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    add_custom_target(printFooKeys
      COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E
        echo $<TARGET_GENEX_EVAL:foo,$<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,CUSTOM_KEYS>>
    )

Organization
============

CMake input files are written in the "CMake Language" in source files
named ``CMakeLists.txt`` or ending in a ``.cmake`` file name extension.

CMake Language source files in a project are organized into:

* `Directories`_ (``CMakeLists.txt``),
* `Scripts`_ (``<script>.cmake``), and
* `Modules`_ (``<module>.cmake``).

Directories
-----------

When CMake processes a project source tree, the entry point is
a source file called ``CMakeLists.txt`` in the top-level source
directory.  This file may contain the entire build specification
or use the :command:`add_subdirectory` command to add subdirectories
to the build.  Each subdirectory added by the command must also
contain a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file as the entry point to that
directory.  For each source directory whose ``CMakeLists.txt`` file
is processed CMake generates a corresponding directory in the build
tree to act as the default working and output directory.

Scripts
-------

An individual ``<script>.cmake`` source file may be processed
in *script mode* by using the :manual:`cmake(1)` command-line tool
with the ``-P`` option.  Script mode simply runs the commands in
the given CMake Language source file and does not generate a
build system.  It does not allow CMake commands that define build
targets or actions.

Modules
-------

CMake Language code in either `Directories`_ or `Scripts`_ may
use the :command:`include` command to load a ``<module>.cmake``
source file in the scope of the including context.
See the :manual:`cmake-modules(7)` manual page for documentation
of modules included with the CMake distribution.
Project source trees may also provide their own modules and
specify their location(s) in the :variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`
variable.

Syntax
======

.. _`CMake Language Encoding`:

Encoding
--------

A CMake Language source file may be written in 7-bit ASCII text for
maximum portability across all supported platforms.  Newlines may be
encoded as either ``\n`` or ``\r\n`` but will be converted to ``\n``
as input files are read.

Note that the implementation is 8-bit clean so source files may
be encoded as UTF-8 on platforms with system APIs supporting this
encoding.  In addition, CMake 3.2 and above support source files
encoded in UTF-8 on Windows (using UTF-16 to call system APIs).
Furthermore, CMake 3.0 and above allow a leading UTF-8
`Byte-Order Mark`_ in source files.

.. _`Byte-Order Mark`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark

Source Files
------------

A CMake Language source file consists of zero or more
`Command Invocations`_ separated by newlines and optionally
spaces and `Comments`_:

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{small}

.. productionlist::
 file: `file_element`*
 file_element: `command_invocation` `line_ending` |
             : (`bracket_comment`|`space`)* `line_ending`
 line_ending: `line_comment`? `newline`
 space: <match '[ \t]+'>
 newline: <match '\n'>

.. raw:: latex

   \end{small}

Note that any source file line not inside `Command Arguments`_ or
a `Bracket Comment`_ can end in a `Line Comment`_.

.. _`Command Invocations`:

Command Invocations
-------------------

A *command invocation* is a name followed by paren-enclosed arguments
separated by whitespace:

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{small}

.. productionlist::
 command_invocation: `space`* `identifier` `space`* '(' `arguments` ')'
 identifier: <match '[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*'>
 arguments: `argument`? `separated_arguments`*
 separated_arguments: `separation`+ `argument`? |
                    : `separation`* '(' `arguments` ')'
 separation: `space` | `line_ending`

.. raw:: latex

   \end{small}

For example:

.. code-block:: cmake

 add_executable(hello world.c)

Command names are case-insensitive.
Nested unquoted parentheses in the arguments must balance.
Each ``(`` or ``)`` is given to the command invocation as
a literal `Unquoted Argument`_.  This may be used in calls
to the :command:`if` command to enclose conditions.
For example:

.. code-block:: cmake

 if(FALSE AND (FALSE OR TRUE)) # evaluates to FALSE

.. note::
 CMake versions prior to 3.0 require command name identifiers
 to be at least 2 characters.

 CMake versions prior to 2.8.12 silently accept an `Unquoted Argument`_
 or a `Quoted Argument`_ immediately following a `Quoted Argument`_ and
 not separated by any whitespace.  For compatibility, CMake 2.8.12 and
 higher accept such code but produce a warning.

Command Arguments
-----------------

There are three types of arguments within `Command Invocations`_:

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{small}

.. productionlist::
 argument: `bracket_argument` | `quoted_argument` | `unquoted_argument`

.. raw:: latex

   \end{small}

.. _`Bracket Argument`:

Bracket Argument
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A *bracket argument*, inspired by `Lua`_ long bracket syntax,
encloses content between opening and closing "brackets" of the
same length:

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{small}

.. productionlist::
 bracket_argument: `bracket_open` `bracket_content` `bracket_close`
 bracket_open: '[' '='* '['
 bracket_content: <any text not containing a `bracket_close` with
                :  the same number of '=' as the `bracket_open`>
 bracket_close: ']' '='* ']'

.. raw:: latex

   \end{small}

An opening bracket is written ``[`` followed by zero or more ``=`` followed
by ``[``.  The corresponding closing bracket is written ``]`` followed
by the same number of ``=`` followed by ``]``.
Brackets do not nest.  A unique length may always be chosen
for the opening and closing brackets to contain closing brackets
of other lengths.

Bracket argument content consists of all text between the opening
and closing brackets, except that one newline immediately following
the opening bracket, if any, is ignored.  No evaluation of the
enclosed content, such as `Escape Sequences`_ or `Variable References`_,
is performed.  A bracket argument is always given to the command
invocation as exactly one argument.

For example:

.. code-block:: cmake

 message([=[
 This is the first line in a bracket argument with bracket length 1.
 No \-escape sequences or ${variable} references are evaluated.
 This is always one argument even though it contains a ; character.
 The text does not end on a closing bracket of length 0 like ]].
 It does end in a closing bracket of length 1.
 ]=])

.. note::
 CMake versions prior to 3.0 do not support bracket arguments.
 They interpret the opening bracket as the start of an
 `Unquoted Argument`_.

.. _`Lua`: http://www.lua.org/

.. _`Quoted Argument`:

Quoted Argument
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A *quoted argument* encloses content between opening and closing
double-quote characters:

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{small}

.. productionlist::
 quoted_argument: '"' `quoted_element`* '"'
 quoted_element: <any character except '\' or '"'> |
                 : `escape_sequence` |
                 : `quoted_continuation`
 quoted_continuation: '\' `newline`

.. raw:: latex

   \end{small}

Quoted argument content consists of all text between opening and
closing quotes.  Both `Escape Sequences`_ and `Variable References`_
are evaluated.  A quoted argument is always given to the command
invocation as exactly one argument.

For example:

::

 message("This is a quoted argument containing multiple lines.
 This is always one argument even though it contains a ; character.
 Both \\-escape sequences and ${variable} references are evaluated.
 The text does not end on an escaped double-quote like \".
 It does end in an unescaped double quote.
 ")

The final ``\`` on any line ending in an odd number of backslashes
is treated as a line continuation and ignored along with the
immediately following newline character.  For example:

.. code-block:: cmake

 message("\
 This is the first line of a quoted argument. \
 In fact it is the only line but since it is long \
 the source code uses line continuation.\
 ")

.. note::
 CMake versions prior to 3.0 do not support continuation with ``\``.
 They report errors in quoted arguments containing lines ending in
 an odd number of ``\`` characters.

.. _`Unquoted Argument`:

Unquoted Argument
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An *unquoted argument* is not enclosed by any quoting syntax.
It may not contain any whitespace, ``(``, ``)``, ``#``, ``"``, or ``\``
except when escaped by a backslash:

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{small}

.. productionlist::
 unquoted_argument: `unquoted_element`+ | `unquoted_legacy`
 unquoted_element: <any character except whitespace or one of '()#"\'> |
                 : `escape_sequence`
 unquoted_legacy: <see note in text>

.. raw:: latex

   \end{small}

Unquoted argument content consists of all text in a contiguous block
of allowed or escaped characters.  Both `Escape Sequences`_ and
`Variable References`_ are evaluated.  The resulting value is divided
in the same way `Lists`_ divide into elements.  Each non-empty element
is given to the command invocation as an argument.  Therefore an
unquoted argument may be given to a command invocation as zero or
more arguments.

For example:

.. code-block:: cmake

 foreach(arg
     NoSpace
     Escaped\ Space
     This;Divides;Into;Five;Arguments
     Escaped\;Semicolon
     )
   message("${arg}")
 endforeach()

.. note::
 To support legacy CMake code, unquoted arguments may also contain
 double-quoted strings (``"..."``, possibly enclosing horizontal
 whitespace), and make-style variable references (``$(MAKEVAR)``).

 Unescaped double-quotes must balance, may not appear at the
 beginning of an unquoted argument, and are treated as part of the
 content.  For example, the unquoted arguments ``-Da="b c"``,
 ``-Da=$(v)``, and ``a" "b"c"d`` are each interpreted literally.
 They may instead be written as quoted arguments ``"-Da=\"b c\""``,
 ``"-Da=$(v)"``, and ``"a\" \"b\"c\"d"``, respectively.

 Make-style references are treated literally as part of the content
 and do not undergo variable expansion.  They are treated as part
 of a single argument (rather than as separate ``$``, ``(``,
 ``MAKEVAR``, and ``)`` arguments).

 The above "unquoted_legacy" production represents such arguments.
 We do not recommend using legacy unquoted arguments in new code.
 Instead use a `Quoted Argument`_ or a `Bracket Argument`_ to
 represent the content.

.. _`Escape Sequences`:

Escape Sequences
----------------

An *escape sequence* is a ``\`` followed by one character:

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{small}

.. productionlist::
 escape_sequence: `escape_identity` | `escape_encoded` | `escape_semicolon`
 escape_identity: '\' <match '[^A-Za-z0-9;]'>
 escape_encoded: '\t' | '\r' | '\n'
 escape_semicolon: '\;'

.. raw:: latex

   \end{small}

A ``\`` followed by a non-alphanumeric character simply encodes the literal
character without interpreting it as syntax.  A ``\t``, ``\r``, or ``\n``
encodes a tab, carriage return, or newline character, respectively. A ``\;``
outside of any `Variable References`_  encodes itself but may be used in an
`Unquoted Argument`_ to encode the ``;`` without dividing the argument
value on it.  A ``\;`` inside `Variable References`_ encodes the literal
``;`` character.  (See also policy :policy:`CMP0053` documentation for
historical considerations.)

.. _`Variable References`:

Variable References
-------------------

A *variable reference* has the form ``${variable_name}`` and is
evaluated inside a `Quoted Argument`_ or an `Unquoted Argument`_.
A variable reference is replaced by the value of the variable,
or by the empty string if the variable is not set.
Variable references can nest and are evaluated from the
inside out, e.g. ``${outer_${inner_variable}_variable}``.

Literal variable references may consist of alphanumeric characters,
the characters ``/_.+-``, and `Escape Sequences`_.  Nested references
may be used to evaluate variables of any name.  (See also policy
:policy:`CMP0053` documentation for historical considerations.)

The `Variables`_ section documents the scope of variable names
and how their values are set.

An *environment variable reference* has the form ``$ENV{VAR}`` and
is evaluated in the same contexts as a normal variable reference.

Comments
--------

A comment starts with a ``#`` character that is not inside a
`Bracket Argument`_, `Quoted Argument`_, or escaped with ``\``
as part of an `Unquoted Argument`_.  There are two types of
comments: a `Bracket Comment`_ and a `Line Comment`_.

.. _`Bracket Comment`:

Bracket Comment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ``#`` immediately followed by a `Bracket Argument`_ forms a
*bracket comment* consisting of the entire bracket enclosure:

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{small}

.. productionlist::
 bracket_comment: '#' `bracket_argument`

.. raw:: latex

   \end{small}

For example:

::

 #[[This is a bracket comment.
 It runs until the close bracket.]]
 message("First Argument\n" #[[Bracket Comment]] "Second Argument")

.. note::
 CMake versions prior to 3.0 do not support bracket comments.
 They interpret the opening ``#`` as the start of a `Line Comment`_.

.. _`Line Comment`:

Line Comment
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ``#`` not immediately followed by a `Bracket Argument`_ forms a
*line comment* that runs until the end of the line:

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{small}

.. productionlist::
 line_comment: '#' <any text not starting in a `bracket_argument`
             :      and not containing a `newline`>

.. raw:: latex

   \end{small}

For example:

.. code-block:: cmake

 # This is a line comment.
 message("First Argument\n" # This is a line comment :)
         "Second Argument") # This is a line comment.

Control Structures
==================

Conditional Blocks
------------------

The :command:`if`/:command:`elseif`/:command:`else`/:command:`endif`
commands delimit code blocks to be executed conditionally.

Loops
-----

The :command:`foreach`/:command:`endforeach` and
:command:`while`/:command:`endwhile` commands delimit code
blocks to be executed in a loop.  Inside such blocks the
:command:`break` command may be used to terminate the loop
early whereas the :command:`continue` command may be used
to start with the next iteration immediately.

Command Definitions
-------------------

The :command:`macro`/:command:`endmacro`, and
:command:`function`/:command:`endfunction` commands delimit
code blocks to be recorded for later invocation as commands.

.. _`CMake Language Variables`:

Variables
=========

Variables are the basic unit of storage in the CMake Language.
Their values are always of string type, though some commands may
interpret the strings as values of other types.
The :command:`set` and :command:`unset` commands explicitly
set or unset a variable, but other commands have semantics
that modify variables as well.
Variable names are case-sensitive and may consist of almost
any text, but we recommend sticking to names consisting only
of alphanumeric characters plus ``_`` and ``-``.

Variables have dynamic scope.  Each variable "set" or "unset"
creates a binding in the current scope:

Function Scope
 `Command Definitions`_ created by the :command:`function` command
 create commands that, when invoked, process the recorded commands
 in a new variable binding scope.  A variable "set" or "unset"
 binds in this scope and is visible for the current function and
 any nested calls within it, but not after the function returns.

Directory Scope
 Each of the `Directories`_ in a source tree has its own variable
 bindings.  Before processing the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file for a
 directory, CMake copies all variable bindings currently defined
 in the parent directory, if any, to initialize the new directory
 scope.  CMake `Scripts`_, when processed with ``cmake -P``, bind
 variables in one "directory" scope.

 A variable "set" or "unset" not inside a function call binds
 to the current directory scope.

Persistent Cache
 CMake stores a separate set of "cache" variables, or "cache entries",
 whose values persist across multiple runs within a project build
 tree.  Cache entries have an isolated binding scope modified only
 by explicit request, such as by the ``CACHE`` option of the
 :command:`set` and :command:`unset` commands.

When evaluating `Variable References`_, CMake first searches the
function call stack, if any, for a binding and then falls back
to the binding in the current directory scope, if any.  If a
"set" binding is found, its value is used.  If an "unset" binding
is found, or no binding is found, CMake then searches for a
cache entry.  If a cache entry is found, its value is used.
Otherwise, the variable reference evaluates to an empty string.

The :manual:`cmake-variables(7)` manual documents many variables
that are provided by CMake or have meaning to CMake when set
by project code.

.. _`CMake Language Lists`:

Lists
=====

Although all values in CMake are stored as strings, a string
may be treated as a list in certain contexts, such as during
evaluation of an `Unquoted Argument`_.  In such contexts, a string
is divided into list elements by splitting on ``;`` characters not
following an unequal number of ``[`` and ``]`` characters and not
immediately preceded by a ``\``.  The sequence ``\;`` does not
divide a value but is replaced by ``;`` in the resulting element.

A list of elements is represented as a string by concatenating
the elements separated by ``;``.  For example, the :command:`set`
command stores multiple values into the destination variable
as a list:

.. code-block:: cmake

 set(srcs a.c b.c c.c) # sets "srcs" to "a.c;b.c;c.c"

Lists are meant for simple use cases such as a list of source
files and should not be used for complex data processing tasks.
Most commands that construct lists do not escape ``;`` characters
in list elements, thus flattening nested lists:

.. code-block:: cmake

 set(x a "b;c") # sets "x" to "a;b;c", not "a;b\;c"

 cmake-gui [<options>]
 cmake-gui [<options>] {<path-to-source> | <path-to-existing-build>}

Description
===========

The "cmake-gui" executable is the CMake GUI.  Project configuration
settings may be specified interactively.  Brief instructions are
provided at the bottom of the window when the program is running.

CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.  Projects specify
their build process with platform-independent CMake listfiles included
in each directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.
Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a
native tool on their platform.

Introduction
============

CMake uses a toolchain of utilities to compile, link libraries and create
archives, and other tasks to drive the build. The toolchain utilities available
are determined by the languages enabled. In normal builds, CMake automatically
determines the toolchain for host builds based on system introspection and
defaults. In cross-compiling scenarios, a toolchain file may be specified
with information about compiler and utility paths.

Languages
=========

Languages are enabled by the :command:`project` command.  Language-specific
built-in variables, such as
:variable:`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER <CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER>`,
:variable:`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID <CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID>` etc are set by
invoking the :command:`project` command.  If no project command
is in the top-level CMakeLists file, one will be implicitly generated. By default
the enabled languages are C and CXX:

.. code-block:: cmake

  project(C_Only C)

A special value of NONE can also be used with the :command:`project` command
to enable no languages:

.. code-block:: cmake

  project(MyProject NONE)

The :command:`enable_language` command can be used to enable languages after the
:command:`project` command:

.. code-block:: cmake

  enable_language(CXX)

When a language is enabled, CMake finds a compiler for that language, and
determines some information, such as the vendor and version of the compiler,
the target architecture and bitwidth, the location of corresponding utilities
etc.

The :prop_gbl:`ENABLED_LANGUAGES` global property contains the languages which
are currently enabled.

Variables and Properties
========================

Several variables relate to the language components of a toolchain which are
enabled. :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER` is the full path to the compiler used
for ``<LANG>``. :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` is the identifier used
by CMake for the compiler and :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION` is the
version of the compiler.

The :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` variables and the configuration-specific
equivalents contain flags that will be added to the compile command when
compiling a file of a particular language.

As the linker is invoked by the compiler driver, CMake needs a way to determine
which compiler to use to invoke the linker. This is calculated by the
:prop_sf:`LANGUAGE` of source files in the target, and in the case of static
libraries, the language of the dependent libraries. The choice CMake makes may
be overridden with the :prop_tgt:`LINKER_LANGUAGE` target property.

Toolchain Features
==================

CMake provides the :command:`try_compile` command and wrapper macros such as
:module:`CheckCXXSourceCompiles`, :module:`CheckCXXSymbolExists` and
:module:`CheckIncludeFile` to test capability and availability of various
toolchain features. These APIs test the toolchain in some way and cache the
result so that the test does not have to be performed again the next time
CMake runs.

Some toolchain features have built-in handling in CMake, and do not require
compile-tests. For example, :prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` allows
specifying that a target should be built as position-independent code, if
the compiler supports that feature. The :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET`
and :prop_tgt:`VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN` target properties add flags for
hidden visibility, if supported by the compiler.

.. _`Cross Compiling Toolchain`:

Cross Compiling
===============

If :manual:`cmake(1)` is invoked with the command line parameter
``-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path/to/file``, the file will be loaded early to set
values for the compilers.
The :variable:`CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING` variable is set to true when CMake is
cross-compiling.

Cross Compiling for Linux
-------------------------

A typical cross-compiling toolchain for Linux has content such
as:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
  set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR arm)

  set(CMAKE_SYSROOT /home/devel/rasp-pi-rootfs)
  set(CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX /home/devel/stage)

  set(tools /home/devel/gcc-4.7-linaro-rpi-gnueabihf)
  set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER ${tools}/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER ${tools}/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++)

  set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
  set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
  set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
  set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE ONLY)

The :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` is the CMake-identifier of the target platform
to build for.

The :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR` is the CMake-identifier of the target architecture
to build for.

The :variable:`CMAKE_SYSROOT` is optional, and may be specified if a sysroot
is available.

The :variable:`CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX` is also optional. It may be used to specify
a path on the host to install to. The :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is always
the runtime installation location, even when cross-compiling.

The :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER` variables may be set to full paths, or to
names of compilers to search for in standard locations.   For toolchains that
do not support linking binaries without custom flags or scripts one may set
the :variable:`CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE` variable to ``STATIC_LIBRARY``
to tell CMake not to try to link executables during its checks.

CMake ``find_*`` commands will look in the sysroot, and the :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`
entries by default in all cases, as well as looking in the host system root prefix.
Although this can be controlled on a case-by-case basis, when cross-compiling, it
can be useful to exclude looking in either the host or the target for particular
artifacts. Generally, includes, libraries and packages should be found in the
target system prefixes, whereas executables which must be run as part of the build
should be found only on the host and not on the target. This is the purpose of
the ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_*`` variables.

.. _`Cray Cross-Compile`:

Cross Compiling for the Cray Linux Environment
----------------------------------------------

Cross compiling for compute nodes in the Cray Linux Environment can be done
without needing a separate toolchain file.  Specifying
``-DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=CrayLinuxEnvironment`` on the CMake command line will
ensure that the appropriate build settings and search paths are configured.
The platform will pull its configuration from the current environment
variables and will configure a project to use the compiler wrappers from the
Cray Programming Environment's ``PrgEnv-*`` modules if present and loaded.

The default configuration of the Cray Programming Environment is to only
support static libraries.  This can be overridden and shared libraries
enabled by setting the ``CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE`` environment variable to
``dynamic``.

Running CMake without specifying :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` will
run the configure step in host mode assuming a standard Linux environment.
If not overridden, the ``PrgEnv-*`` compiler wrappers will end up getting used,
which if targeting the either the login node or compute node, is likely not the
desired behavior.  The exception to this would be if you are building directly
on a NID instead of cross-compiling from a login node. If trying to build
software for a login node, you will need to either first unload the
currently loaded ``PrgEnv-*`` module or explicitly tell CMake to use the
system compilers in ``/usr/bin`` instead of the Cray wrappers.  If instead
targeting a compute node is desired, just specify the
:variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` as mentioned above.

Cross Compiling using Clang
---------------------------

Some compilers such as Clang are inherently cross compilers.
The :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_TARGET` can be set to pass a
value to those supported compilers when compiling:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
  set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR arm)

  set(triple arm-linux-gnueabihf)

  set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER clang)
  set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER_TARGET ${triple})
  set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER clang++)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_TARGET ${triple})

Similarly, some compilers do not ship their own supplementary utilities
such as linkers, but provide a way to specify the location of the external
toolchain which will be used by the compiler driver. The
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN` variable can be set in a
toolchain file to pass the path to the compiler driver.

Cross Compiling for QNX
-----------------------

As the Clang compiler the QNX QCC compile is inherently a cross compiler.
And the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_TARGET` can be set to pass a
value to those supported compilers when compiling:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME QNX)

  set(arch gcc_ntoarmv7le)

  set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER qcc)
  set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER_TARGET ${arch})
  set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER QCC)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_TARGET ${arch})

Cross Compiling for Windows CE
------------------------------

Cross compiling for Windows CE requires the corresponding SDK being
installed on your system.  These SDKs are usually installed under
``C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows CE Tools/SDKs``.

A toolchain file to configure a Visual Studio generator for
Windows CE may look like this:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME WindowsCE)

  set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION 8.0)
  set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR arm)

  set(CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET CE800) # Can be omitted for 8.0
  set(CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM SDK_AM335X_SK_WEC2013_V310)

The :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM` tells the generator which SDK to use.
Further :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION` tells the generator what version of
Windows CE to use.  Currently version 8.0 (Windows Embedded Compact 2013) is
supported out of the box.  Other versions may require one to set
:variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET` to the correct value.

Cross Compiling for Windows 10 Universal Applications
-----------------------------------------------------

A toolchain file to configure a Visual Studio generator for a
Windows 10 Universal Application may look like this:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME WindowsStore)
  set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION 10.0)

A Windows 10 Universal Application targets both Windows Store and
Windows Phone.  Specify the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION` variable
to be ``10.0`` to build with the latest available Windows 10 SDK.
Specify a more specific version (e.g. ``10.0.10240.0`` for RTM)
to build with the corresponding SDK.

Cross Compiling for Windows Phone
---------------------------------

A toolchain file to configure a Visual Studio generator for
Windows Phone may look like this:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME WindowsPhone)
  set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION 8.1)

Cross Compiling for Windows Store
---------------------------------

A toolchain file to configure a Visual Studio generator for
Windows Store may look like this:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME WindowsStore)
  set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION 8.1)

.. _`Cross Compiling for Android`:

Cross Compiling for Android
---------------------------

A toolchain file may configure cross-compiling for Android by setting the
:variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` variable to ``Android``.  Further configuration
is specific to the Android development environment to be used.

For :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`, CMake expects :ref:`NVIDIA Nsight Tegra
Visual Studio Edition <Cross Compiling for Android with NVIDIA Nsight Tegra
Visual Studio Edition>` to be installed.  See that section for further
configuration details.

For :ref:`Makefile Generators` and the :generator:`Ninja` generator,
CMake expects one of these environments:

* :ref:`NDK <Cross Compiling for Android with the NDK>`
* :ref:`Standalone Toolchain <Cross Compiling for Android with a Standalone Toolchain>`

CMake uses the following steps to select one of the environments:

* If the :variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK` variable is set, the NDK at the
  specified location will be used.

* Else, if the :variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN` variable
  is set, the Standalone Toolchain at the specified location will be used.

* Else, if the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSROOT` variable is set to a directory
  of the form ``<ndk>/platforms/android-<api>/arch-<arch>``, the ``<ndk>``
  part will be used as the value of :variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK` and the
  NDK will be used.

* Else, if the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSROOT` variable is set to a directory of the
  form ``<standalone-toolchain>/sysroot``, the ``<standalone-toolchain>`` part
  will be used as the value of :variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN`
  and the Standalone Toolchain will be used.

* Else, if a cmake variable ``ANDROID_NDK`` is set it will be used
  as the value of :variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK`, and the NDK will be used.

* Else, if a cmake variable ``ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN`` is set, it will be
  used as the value of :variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN`, and the
  Standalone Toolchain will be used.

* Else, if an environment variable ``ANDROID_NDK_ROOT`` or
  ``ANDROID_NDK`` is set, it will be used as the value of
  :variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK`, and the NDK will be used.

* Else, if an environment variable ``ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN`` is
  set then it will be used as the value of
  :variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN`, and the Standalone
  Toolchain will be used.

* Else, an error diagnostic will be issued that neither the NDK or
  Standalone Toolchain can be found.

.. _`Cross Compiling for Android with the NDK`:

Cross Compiling for Android with the NDK
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A toolchain file may configure :ref:`Makefile Generators` or the
:generator:`Ninja` generator to target Android for cross-compiling.

Configure use of an Android NDK with the following variables:

:variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`
  Set to ``Android``.  Must be specified to enable cross compiling
  for Android.

:variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION`
  Set to the Android API level.  If not specified, the value is
  determined as follows:

  * If the :variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_API` variable is set, its value
    is used as the API level.
  * If the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSROOT` variable is set, the API level is
    detected from the NDK directory structure containing the sysroot.
  * Otherwise, the latest API level available in the NDK is used.

:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH_ABI`
  Set to the Android ABI (architecture).  If not specified, this
  variable will default to ``armeabi``.
  The :variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH` variable will be computed
  from ``CMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH_ABI`` automatically.
  Also see the :variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_ARM_MODE` and
  :variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_ARM_NEON` variables.

:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK`
  Set to the absolute path to the Android NDK root directory.
  A ``${CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK}/platforms`` directory must exist.
  If not specified, a default for this variable will be chosen
  as specified :ref:`above <Cross Compiling for Android>`.

:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK_DEPRECATED_HEADERS`
  Set to a true value to use the deprecated per-api-level headers
  instead of the unified headers.  If not specified, the default will
  be false unless using a NDK that does not provide unified headers.

:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK_TOOLCHAIN_VERSION`
  Set to the version of the NDK toolchain to be selected as the compiler.
  If not specified, the default will be the latest available GCC toolchain.

:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_STL_TYPE`
  Set to specify which C++ standard library to use.  If not specified,
  a default will be selected as described in the variable documentation.

The following variables will be computed and provided automatically:

:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX`
  The absolute path prefix to the binutils in the NDK toolchain.

:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_SUFFIX`
  The host platform suffix of the binutils in the NDK toolchain.


For example, a toolchain file might contain:

  set(CMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH_ABI arm64-v8a)
  set(CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK /path/to/android-ndk)
  set(CMAKE_ANDROID_STL_TYPE gnustl_static)

Alternatively one may specify the values without a toolchain file:

.. _`Cross Compiling for Android with a Standalone Toolchain`:

Cross Compiling for Android with a Standalone Toolchain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A toolchain file may configure :ref:`Makefile Generators` or the
:generator:`Ninja` generator to target Android for cross-compiling
using a standalone toolchain.

Configure use of an Android standalone toolchain with the following variables:

:variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`
  Set to ``Android``.  Must be specified to enable cross compiling
  for Android.

:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN`
  Set to the absolute path to the standalone toolchain root directory.
  A ``${CMAKE_ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN}/sysroot`` directory
  must exist.
  If not specified, a default for this variable will be chosen
  as specified :ref:`above <Cross Compiling for Android>`.

:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_ARM_MODE`
  When the standalone toolchain targets ARM, optionally set this to ``ON``
  to target 32-bit ARM instead of 16-bit Thumb.
  See variable documentation for details.

:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_ARM_NEON`
  When the standalone toolchain targets ARM v7, optionally set thisto ``ON``
  to target ARM NEON devices.  See variable documentation for details.

The following variables will be computed and provided automatically:

:variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION`
  The Android API level detected from the standalone toolchain.

:variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH_ABI`
  The Android ABI detected from the standalone toolchain.

:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX`
  The absolute path prefix to the binutils in the standalone toolchain.

:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_SUFFIX`
  The host platform suffix of the binutils in the standalone toolchain.

For example, a toolchain file might contain:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Android)
  set(CMAKE_ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN /path/to/android-toolchain)

Alternatively one may specify the values without a toolchain file:

.. code-block:: console

  $ cmake ../src \
    -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=Android \
    -DCMAKE_ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN=/path/to/android-toolchain

.. _`Cross Compiling for Android with NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual Studio Edition`:

Cross Compiling for Android with NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual Studio Edition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A toolchain file to configure one of the :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`
to build using NVIDIA Nsight Tegra targeting Android may look like this:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Android)

The :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET` may be set to select
the Nsight Tegra "Toolchain Version" value.

ccmake(1)
*********

Synopsis
========

.. parsed-literal::

 ccmake [<options>] {<path-to-source> | <path-to-existing-build>}

Description
===========

The "ccmake" executable is the CMake curses interface.  Project
configuration settings may be specified interactively through this
GUI.  Brief instructions are provided at the bottom of the terminal
when the program is running.

CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.  Projects specify
their build process with platform-independent CMake listfiles included
in each directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.
Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a
native tool on their platform.

Synopsis
========

.. parsed-literal::

 ctest [<options>]
 ctest <path-to-source> <path-to-build> --build-generator <generator>
       [<options>...] [-- <build-options>...] [--test-command <test>]
 ctest {-D <dashboard> | -M <model> -T <action> | -S <script> | -SP <script>}
       [-- <dashboard-options>...]

Description
===========

The "ctest" executable is the CMake test driver program.
CMake-generated build trees created for projects that use the
ENABLE_TESTING and ADD_TEST commands have testing support.  This
program will run the tests and report results.

Options
=======

``-C <cfg>, --build-config <cfg>``
 Choose configuration to test.

 Some CMake-generated build trees can have multiple build
 configurations in the same tree.  This option can be used to specify
 which one should be tested.  Example configurations are "Debug" and
 "Release".

``-V,--verbose``
 Enable verbose output from tests.

 Test output is normally suppressed and only summary information is
 displayed.  This option will show all test output.

``-VV,--extra-verbose``
 Enable more verbose output from tests.

 Test output is normally suppressed and only summary information is
 displayed.  This option will show even more test output.

``--debug``
 Displaying more verbose internals of CTest.

 This feature will result in a large number of output that is mostly
 useful for debugging dashboard problems.

``--output-on-failure``
 Output anything outputted by the test program if the test should fail.
 This option can also be enabled by setting the environment variable
 ``CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE``.

``-F``
 Enable failover.

 This option allows CTest to resume a test set execution that was
 previously interrupted.  If no interruption occurred, the ``-F`` option
 will have no effect.

``-j <jobs>, --parallel <jobs>``
 Run the tests in parallel using the given number of jobs.

 This option tells CTest to run the tests in parallel using given
 number of jobs. This option can also be set by setting the
 environment variable ``CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL``.

 This option can be used with the :prop_test:`PROCESSORS` test property.

 See `Label and Subproject Summary`_.

``--test-load <level>``
 While running tests in parallel (e.g. with ``-j``), try not to start
 tests when they may cause the CPU load to pass above a given threshold.

 When ``ctest`` is run as a `Dashboard Client`_ this sets the
 ``TestLoad`` option of the `CTest Test Step`_.

``-Q,--quiet``
 Make CTest quiet.

 This option will suppress all the output.  The output log file will
 still be generated if the ``--output-log`` is specified.  Options such
 as ``--verbose``, ``--extra-verbose``, and ``--debug`` are ignored
 if ``--quiet`` is specified.

``-O <file>, --output-log <file>``
 Output to log file.

 This option tells CTest to write all its output to a log file.

``-N,--show-only``
 Disable actual execution of tests.

 This option tells CTest to list the tests that would be run but not
 actually run them.  Useful in conjunction with the ``-R`` and ``-E``
 options.

``-L <regex>, --label-regex <regex>``
 Run tests with labels matching regular expression.

 This option tells CTest to run only the tests whose labels match the
 given regular expression.

``-R <regex>, --tests-regex <regex>``
 Run tests matching regular expression.

 This option tells CTest to run only the tests whose names match the
 given regular expression.

``-E <regex>, --exclude-regex <regex>``
 Exclude tests matching regular expression.

 This option tells CTest to NOT run the tests whose names match the
 given regular expression.

``-LE <regex>, --label-exclude <regex>``
 Exclude tests with labels matching regular expression.

 This option tells CTest to NOT run the tests whose labels match the
 given regular expression.

``-FA <regex>, --fixture-exclude-any <regex>``
 Exclude fixtures matching ``<regex>`` from automatically adding any tests to
 the test set.

 If a test in the set of tests to be executed requires a particular fixture,
 that fixture's setup and cleanup tests would normally be added to the test set
 automatically. This option prevents adding setup or cleanup tests for fixtures
 matching the ``<regex>``. Note that all other fixture behavior is retained,
 including test dependencies and skipping tests that have fixture setup tests
 that fail.

``-FS <regex>, --fixture-exclude-setup <regex>``
 Same as ``-FA`` except only matching setup tests are excluded.

``-FC <regex>, --fixture-exclude-cleanup <regex>``
 Same as ``-FA`` except only matching cleanup tests are excluded.

``-D <dashboard>, --dashboard <dashboard>``
 Execute dashboard test.

 This option tells CTest to act as a CDash client and perform a
 dashboard test.  All tests are <Mode><Test>, where Mode can be
 Experimental, Nightly, and Continuous, and Test can be Start,
 Update, Configure, Build, Test, Coverage, and Submit.

 See `Dashboard Client`_.

``-D <var>:<type>=<value>``
 Define a variable for script mode.

 Pass in variable values on the command line.  Use in conjunction
 with ``-S`` to pass variable values to a dashboard script.  Parsing ``-D``
 arguments as variable values is only attempted if the value
 following ``-D`` does not match any of the known dashboard types.

``-M <model>, --test-model <model>``
 Sets the model for a dashboard.

 This option tells CTest to act as a CDash client where the ``<model>``
 can be ``Experimental``, ``Nightly``, and ``Continuous``.
 Combining ``-M`` and ``-T`` is similar to ``-D``.

 See `Dashboard Client`_.

``-T <action>, --test-action <action>``
 Sets the dashboard action to perform.

 This option tells CTest to act as a CDash client and perform some
 action such as ``start``, ``build``, ``test`` etc. See
 `Dashboard Client Steps`_ for the full list of actions.
 Combining ``-M`` and ``-T`` is similar to ``-D``.

 See `Dashboard Client`_.

``-S <script>, --script <script>``
 Execute a dashboard for a configuration.

 This option tells CTest to load in a configuration script which sets
 a number of parameters such as the binary and source directories.
 Then CTest will do what is required to create and run a dashboard.
 This option basically sets up a dashboard and then runs ``ctest -D``
 with the appropriate options.

 See `Dashboard Client`_.

``-SP <script>, --script-new-process <script>``
 Execute a dashboard for a configuration.

 This option does the same operations as ``-S`` but it will do them in a
 separate process.  This is primarily useful in cases where the
 script may modify the environment and you do not want the modified
 environment to impact other ``-S`` scripts.

 See `Dashboard Client`_.

``-I [Start,End,Stride,test#,test#|Test file], --tests-information``
 Run a specific number of tests by number.

 This option causes CTest to run tests starting at number Start,
 ending at number End, and incrementing by Stride.  Any additional
 numbers after Stride are considered individual test numbers.  Start,
 End,or stride can be empty.  Optionally a file can be given that
 contains the same syntax as the command line.

``-U, --union``
 Take the Union of ``-I`` and ``-R``.

 When both ``-R`` and ``-I`` are specified by default the intersection of
 tests are run.  By specifying ``-U`` the union of tests is run instead.

``--rerun-failed``
 Run only the tests that failed previously.

 This option tells CTest to perform only the tests that failed during
 its previous run.  When this option is specified, CTest ignores all
 other options intended to modify the list of tests to run (``-L``, ``-R``,
 ``-E``, ``-LE``, ``-I``, etc).  In the event that CTest runs and no tests
 fail, subsequent calls to CTest with the ``--rerun-failed`` option will run
 the set of tests that most recently failed (if any).

``--repeat-until-fail <n>``
 Require each test to run ``<n>`` times without failing in order to pass.

 This is useful in finding sporadic failures in test cases.

``--max-width <width>``
 Set the max width for a test name to output.

 Set the maximum width for each test name to show in the output.
 This allows the user to widen the output to avoid clipping the test
 name which can be very annoying.

``--interactive-debug-mode [0|1]``
 Set the interactive mode to 0 or 1.

 This option causes CTest to run tests in either an interactive mode
 or a non-interactive mode.  On Windows this means that in
 non-interactive mode, all system debug pop up windows are blocked.
 In dashboard mode (Experimental, Nightly, Continuous), the default
 is non-interactive.  When just running tests not for a dashboard the
 default is to allow popups and interactive debugging.

``--no-label-summary``
 Disable timing summary information for labels.

 This option tells CTest not to print summary information for each
 label associated with the tests run.  If there are no labels on the
 tests, nothing extra is printed.

 See `Label and Subproject Summary`_.

``--no-subproject-summary``
 Disable timing summary information for subprojects.

 This option tells CTest not to print summary information for each
 subproject associated with the tests run.  If there are no subprojects on the
 tests, nothing extra is printed.

 See `Label and Subproject Summary`_.

``--build-and-test``
See `Build and Test Mode`_.

``--test-output-size-passed <size>``
 Limit the output for passed tests to ``<size>`` bytes.

``--test-output-size-failed <size>``
 Limit the output for failed tests to ``<size>`` bytes.

``--overwrite``
 Overwrite CTest configuration option.

 By default CTest uses configuration options from configuration file.
 This option will overwrite the configuration option.

``--force-new-ctest-process``
 Run child CTest instances as new processes.

 By default CTest will run child CTest instances within the same
 process.  If this behavior is not desired, this argument will
 enforce new processes for child CTest processes.

``--schedule-random``
 Use a random order for scheduling tests.

 This option will run the tests in a random order.  It is commonly
 used to detect implicit dependencies in a test suite.

``--submit-index``
 Legacy option for old Dart2 dashboard server feature.
 Do not use.

``--timeout <seconds>``
 Set a global timeout on all tests.

 This option will set a global timeout on all tests that do not
 already have a timeout set on them.

``--stop-time <time>``
 Set a time at which all tests should stop running.

 Set a real time of day at which all tests should timeout.  Example:
 ``7:00:00 -0400``.  Any time format understood by the curl date parser
 is accepted.  Local time is assumed if no timezone is specified.

``--print-labels``
 Print all available test labels.

 This option will not run any tests, it will simply print the list of
 all labels associated with the test set.

.. include:: OPTIONS_HELP.txt

.. _`Label and Subproject Summary`:

Label and Subproject Summary
============================

CTest prints timing summary information for each label and subproject
associated with the tests run. The label time summary will not include labels
that are mapped to subprojects.

When the :prop_test:`PROCESSORS` test property is set, CTest will display a
weighted test timing result in label and subproject summaries. The time is
reported with `sec*proc` instead of just `sec`.

The weighted time summary reported for each label or subproject j is computed
as::

  Weighted Time Summary for Label/Subproject j =
      sum(raw_test_time[j,i] * num_processors[j,i], i=1...num_tests[j])

  for labels/subprojects j=1...total

where:

* raw_test_time[j,i]: Wall-clock time for the ith test for the jth label or
  subproject
* num_processors[j,i]: Value of the CTest PROCESSORS property for the ith test
  for the jth label or subproject
* num_tests[j]: Number of tests associated with the jth label or subproject
* total: Total number of labels or subprojects that have at least one test run

Therefore, the weighted time summary for each label or subproject represents
the amount of time that CTest gave to run the tests for each label or
subproject and gives a good representation of the total expense of the tests
for each label or subproject when compared to other labels or subprojects.

For example, if "SubprojectA" showed "100 sec*proc" and "SubprojectB" showed
"10 sec*proc", then CTest allocated approximately  10 times the CPU/core time
to run the tests for "SubprojectA" than for "SubprojectB" (e.g. so if effort
is going to be expended to reduce the cost of the test suite for the whole
project, then reducing the cost of the test suite for "SubprojectA" would
likely have a larger impact than effort to reduce the cost of the test suite
for "SubprojectB").

.. _`Build and Test Mode`:

Build and Test Mode
===================

CTest provides a command-line signature to configure (i.e. run cmake on),
build, and/or execute a test::

  ctest --build-and-test <path-to-source> <path-to-build>
        --build-generator <generator>
        [<options>...]
        [--build-options <opts>...]
        [--test-command <command> [<args>...]]

The configure and test steps are optional. The arguments to this command line
are the source and binary directories.  The ``--build-generator`` option *must*
be provided to use ``--build-and-test``.  If ``--test-command`` is specified
then that will be run after the build is complete.  Other options that affect
this mode include:

``--build-target``
 Specify a specific target to build.

 If left out the ``all`` target is built.

``--build-nocmake``
 Run the build without running cmake first.

 Skip the cmake step.

``--build-run-dir``
 Specify directory to run programs from.

 Directory where programs will be after it has been compiled.

``--build-two-config``
 Run CMake twice.

``--build-exe-dir``
 Specify the directory for the executable.

``--build-generator``
 Specify the generator to use. See the :manual:`cmake-generators(7)` manual.

``--build-generator-platform``
 Specify the generator-specific platform.

``--build-generator-toolset``
 Specify the generator-specific toolset.

``--build-project``
 Specify the name of the project to build.

``--build-makeprogram``
 Override the make program chosen by CTest with a given one.

``--build-noclean``
 Skip the make clean step.

``--build-config-sample``
 A sample executable to use to determine the configuration that
 should be used.  e.g.  Debug/Release/etc.

``--build-options``
 Additional options for configuring the build (i.e. for CMake, not for
 the build tool).  Note that if this is specified, the ``--build-options``
 keyword and its arguments must be the last option given on the command
 line, with the possible exception of ``--test-command``.

``--test-command``
 The command to run as the test step with the ``--build-and-test`` option.
 All arguments following this keyword will be assumed to be part of the
 test command line, so it must be the last option given.

``--test-timeout``
 The time limit in seconds

.. _`Dashboard Client`:

Dashboard Client
================

CTest can operate as a client for the `CDash`_ software quality dashboard
application.  As a dashboard client, CTest performs a sequence of steps
to configure, build, and test software, and then submits the results to
a `CDash`_ server. The command-line signature used to submit to `CDash`_ is::

  ctest (-D <dashboard> | -M <model> -T <action> | -S <script> | -SP <script>)
        [-- <dashboard-options>...]

Options for Dashboard Client include:

``--track <track>``
 Specify the track to submit dashboard to

 Submit dashboard to specified track instead of default one.  By
 default, the dashboard is submitted to Nightly, Experimental, or
 Continuous track, but by specifying this option, the track can be
 arbitrary.

``-A <file>, --add-notes <file>``
 Add a notes file with submission.

 This option tells CTest to include a notes file when submitting
 dashboard.

``--tomorrow-tag``
 Nightly or experimental starts with next day tag.

 This is useful if the build will not finish in one day.

``--extra-submit <file>[;<file>]``
 Submit extra files to the dashboard.

 This option will submit extra files to the dashboard.

``--http1.0``
 Submit using HTTP 1.0.

 This option will force CTest to use HTTP 1.0 to submit files to the
 dashboard, instead of HTTP 1.1.

``--no-compress-output``
 Do not compress test output when submitting.

 This flag will turn off automatic compression of test output.  Use
 this to maintain compatibility with an older version of CDash which
 doesn't support compressed test output.

Dashboard Client Steps
----------------------

CTest defines an ordered list of testing steps of which some or all may
be run as a dashboard client:

``Start``
  Start a new dashboard submission to be composed of results recorded
  by the following steps.
  See the `CTest Start Step`_ section below.

``Update``
  Update the source tree from its version control repository.
  Record the old and new versions and the list of updated source files.
  See the `CTest Update Step`_ section below.

``Configure``
  Configure the software by running a command in the build tree.
  Record the configuration output log.
  See the `CTest Configure Step`_ section below.

``Build``
  Build the software by running a command in the build tree.
  Record the build output log and detect warnings and errors.
  See the `CTest Build Step`_ section below.

``Test``
  Test the software by loading a ``CTestTestfile.cmake``
  from the build tree and executing the defined tests.
  Record the output and result of each test.
  See the `CTest Test Step`_ section below.

``Coverage``
  Compute coverage of the source code by running a coverage
  analysis tool and recording its output.
  See the `CTest Coverage Step`_ section below.

``MemCheck``
  Run the software test suite through a memory check tool.
  Record the test output, results, and issues reported by the tool.
  See the `CTest MemCheck Step`_ section below.

``Submit``
  Submit results recorded from other testing steps to the
  software quality dashboard server.
  See the `CTest Submit Step`_ section below.

Dashboard Client Modes
----------------------

CTest defines three modes of operation as a dashboard client:

``Nightly``
  This mode is intended to be invoked once per day, typically at night.
  It enables the ``Start``, ``Update``, ``Configure``, ``Build``, ``Test``,
  ``Coverage``, and ``Submit`` steps by default.  Selected steps run even
  if the ``Update`` step reports no changes to the source tree.

``Continuous``
  This mode is intended to be invoked repeatedly throughout the day.
  It enables the ``Start``, ``Update``, ``Configure``, ``Build``, ``Test``,
  ``Coverage``, and ``Submit`` steps by default, but exits after the
  ``Update`` step if it reports no changes to the source tree.

``Experimental``
  This mode is intended to be invoked by a developer to test local changes.
  It enables the ``Start``, ``Configure``, ``Build``, ``Test``, ``Coverage``,
  and ``Submit`` steps by default.

Dashboard Client via CTest Command-Line
---------------------------------------

CTest can perform testing on an already-generated build tree.
Run the ``ctest`` command with the current working directory set
to the build tree and use one of these signatures::

  ctest -D <mode>[<step>]
  ctest -M <mode> [ -T <step> ]...

The ``<mode>`` must be one of the above `Dashboard Client Modes`_,
and each ``<step>`` must be one of the above `Dashboard Client Steps`_.

CTest reads the `Dashboard Client Configuration`_ settings from
a file in the build tree called either ``CTestConfiguration.ini``
or ``DartConfiguration.tcl`` (the names are historical).  The format
of the file is::

  # Lines starting in '#' are comments.
  # Other non-blank lines are key-value pairs.
  <setting>: <value>

where ``<setting>`` is the setting name and ``<value>`` is the
setting value.

In build trees generated by CMake, this configuration file is
generated by the :module:`CTest` module if included by the project.
The module uses variables to obtain a value for each setting
as documented with the settings below.

.. _`CTest Script`:

Dashboard Client via CTest Script
---------------------------------

CTest can perform testing driven by a :manual:`cmake-language(7)`
script that creates and maintains the source and build tree as
well as performing the testing steps.  Run the ``ctest`` command
with the current working directory set outside of any build tree
and use one of these signatures::

  ctest -S <script>
  ctest -SP <script>

The ``<script>`` file must call :ref:`CTest Commands` commands
to run testing steps explicitly as documented below.  The commands
obtain `Dashboard Client Configuration`_ settings from their
arguments or from variables set in the script.

Dashboard Client Configuration
==============================

The `Dashboard Client Steps`_ may be configured by named
settings as documented in the following sections.

.. _`CTest Start Step`:

CTest Start Step
----------------

Start a new dashboard submission to be composed of results recorded
by the following steps.

In a `CTest Script`_, the :command:`ctest_start` command runs this step.
Arguments to the command may specify some of the step settings.
The command first runs the command-line specified by the
``CTEST_CHECKOUT_COMMAND`` variable, if set, to initialize the source
directory.

Configuration settings include:

  to a different version.

  * `CTest Script`_ variable: :variable:`CTEST_UPDATE_VERSION_ONLY`


Additional configuration settings include:

``NightlyStartTime``
  In the ``Nightly`` dashboard mode, specify the "nightly start time".
  With centralized version control systems (``cvs`` and ``svn``),
  the ``Update`` step checks out the version of the software as of
  this time so that multiple clients choose a common version to test.
  This is not well-defined in distributed version-control systems so
  the setting is ignored.

  * `CTest Script`_ variable: :variable:`CTEST_NIGHTLY_START_TIME`
  * :module:`CTest` module variable: ``NIGHTLY_START_TIME`` if set,
    else ``CTEST_NIGHTLY_START_TIME``

  generator, specify whether the
  ``CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS`` feature is enabled by the
  :module:`CTestUseLaunchers` module (also included by the
  :module:`CTest` module).  When enabled, the generated build
  system wraps each invocation of the compiler, linker, or
  custom command line with a "launcher" that communicates
  with CTest via environment variables and files to report
  granular build warning and error information.  Otherwise,

cmake-server(7)
***************

.. only:: html

   .. contents::

Introduction
============

:manual:`cmake(1)` is capable of providing semantic information about
CMake code it executes to generate a buildsystem.  If executed with
the ``-E server`` command line options, it starts in a long running mode
and allows a client to request the available information via a JSON protocol.

The protocol is designed to be useful to IDEs, refactoring tools, and
other tools which have a need to understand the buildsystem in entirety.

A single :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)` may describe buildsystem contents
and build properties which differ based on
:manual:`generation-time context <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
including:

* The Platform (eg, Windows, APPLE, Linux).
* The build configuration (eg, Debug, Release, Coverage).
* The Compiler (eg, MSVC, GCC, Clang) and compiler version.
* The language of the source files compiled.
* Available compile features (eg CXX variadic templates).
* CMake policies.

The protocol aims to provide information to tooling to satisfy several
needs:

#. Provide a complete and easily parsed source of all information relevant
   to the tooling as it relates to the source code.  There should be no need
   for tooling to parse generated buildsystems to access include directories
   or compile definitions for example.
#. Semantic information about the CMake buildsystem itself.
#. Provide a stable interface for reading the information in the CMake cache.
#. Information for determining when cmake needs to be re-run as a result of
   file changes.


Operation
=========

Start :manual:`cmake(1)` in the server command mode, supplying the path to
the build directory to process::

  cmake -E server (--debug|--pipe=<NAMED_PIPE>)

The server will communicate using stdin/stdout (with the ``--debug`` parameter)
or using a named pipe (with the ``--pipe=<NAMED_PIPE>`` parameter).  Note
that "named pipe" refers to a local domain socket on Unix and to a named pipe
on Windows.

When connecting to the server (via named pipe or by starting it in ``--debug``
mode), the server will reply with a hello message::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {"supportedProtocolVersions":[{"major":1,"minor":0}],"type":"hello"}
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]

Messages sent to and from the process are wrapped in magic strings::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {
    ... some JSON message ...
  }
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]

The server is now ready to accept further requests via the named pipe
or stdin.


Debugging
=========

CMake server mode can be asked to provide statistics on execution times, etc.
or to dump a copy of the response into a file. This is done passing a "debug"
JSON object as a child of the request.

The debug object supports the "showStats" key, which takes a boolean and makes
the server mode return a "zzzDebug" object with stats as part of its response.
"dumpToFile" takes a string value and will cause the cmake server to copy
the response into the given filename.

This is a response from the cmake server with "showStats" set to true::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {
    "cookie":"",
    "errorMessage":"Waiting for type \"handshake\".",
    "inReplyTo":"unknown",
   "type":"error",
    "zzzDebug": {
      "dumpFile":"/tmp/error.txt",
      "jsonSerialization":0.011016,
      "size":111,
      "totalTime":0.025995
    }
  }
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]

The server has made a copy of this response into the file /tmp/error.txt and
took 0.011 seconds to turn the JSON response into a string, and it took 0.025
seconds to process the request in total. The reply has a size of 111 bytes.


Protocol API
============


General Message Layout
----------------------

All messages need to have a "type" value, which identifies the type of
message that is passed back or forth. E.g. the initial message sent by the
server is of type "hello". Messages without a type will generate an response
of type "error".

All requests sent to the server may contain a "cookie" value. This value
will he handed back unchanged in all responses triggered by the request.

All responses will contain a value "inReplyTo", which may be empty in
case of parse errors, but will contain the type of the request message
in all other cases.


Type "reply"
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This type is used by the server to reply to requests.

The message may -- depending on the type of the original request --
contain values.

Example::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {"cookie":"zimtstern","inReplyTo":"handshake","type":"reply"}
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]


Type "error"
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This type is used to return an error condition to the client. It will
contain an "errorMessage".

Example::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {"cookie":"","errorMessage":"Protocol version not supported.","inReplyTo":"handshake","type":"error"}
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]


Type "progress"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the server is busy for a long time, it is polite to send back replies of
type "progress" to the client. These will contain a "progressMessage" with a
string describing the action currently taking place as well as
"progressMinimum", "progressMaximum" and "progressCurrent" with integer values
describing the range of progress.

Messages of type "progress" will be followed by more "progress" messages or with
a message of type "reply" or "error" that complete the request.

"progress" messages may not be emitted after the "reply" or "error" message for
the request that triggered the responses was delivered.


Type "message"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A message is triggered when the server processes a request and produces some
form of output that should be displayed to the user. A Message has a "message"
with the actual text to display as well as a "title" with a suggested dialog
box title.

Example::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {"cookie":"","message":"Something happened.","title":"Title Text","inReplyTo":"handshake","type":"message"}
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]


Type "signal"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The server can send signals when it detects changes in the system state. Signals
are of type "signal", have an empty "cookie" and "inReplyTo" field and always
have a "name" set to show which signal was sent.


Specific Signals
----------------

The cmake server may sent signals with the following names:

"dirty" Signal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "dirty" signal is sent whenever the server determines that the configuration
of the project is no longer up-to-date. This happens when any of the files that have
an influence on the build system is changed.

The "dirty" signal may look like this::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {
    "cookie":"",
    "inReplyTo":"",
    "name":"dirty",
    "type":"signal"}
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]


"fileChange" Signal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "fileChange" signal is sent whenever a watched file is changed. It contains
the "path" that has changed and a list of "properties" with the kind of change
that was detected. Possible changes are "change" and "rename".

The "fileChange" signal looks like this::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {
    "cookie":"",
    "inReplyTo":"",
    "name":"fileChange",
    "path":"/absolute/CMakeLists.txt",
    "properties":["change"],
    "type":"signal"}
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]


Specific Message Types
----------------------


Type "hello"
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The initial message send by the cmake server on startup is of type "hello".
This is the only message ever sent by the server that is not of type "reply",
"progress" or "error".

It will contain "supportedProtocolVersions" with an array of server protocol
versions supported by the cmake server. These are JSON objects with "major" and
"minor" keys containing non-negative integer values. Some versions may be marked
as experimental. These will contain the "isExperimental" key set to true. Enabling
these requires a special command line argument when starting the cmake server mode.

Within a "major" version all "minor" versions are fully backwards compatible.
New "minor" versions may introduce functionality in such a way that existing
clients of the same "major" version will continue to work, provided they
ignore keys in the output that they do not know about.

Example::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {"supportedProtocolVersions":[{"major":0,"minor":1}],"type":"hello"}
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]


Type "handshake"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first request that the client may send to the server is of type "handshake".

This request needs to pass one of the "supportedProtocolVersions" of the "hello"
type response received earlier back to the server in the "protocolVersion" field.
Giving the "major" version of the requested protocol version will make the server
use the latest minor version of that protocol. Use this if you do not explicitly
need to depend on a specific minor version.

Protocol version 1.0 requires the following attributes to be set:

  * "sourceDirectory" with a path to the sources
  * "buildDirectory" with a path to the build directory
  * "generator" with the generator name
  * "extraGenerator" (optional!) with the extra generator to be used
  * "platform" with the generator platform (if supported by the generator)
  * "toolset" with the generator toolset (if supported by the generator)

Protocol version 1.2 makes all but the build directory optional, provided
there is a valid cache in the build directory that contains all the other
information already.

Example::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {"cookie":"zimtstern","type":"handshake","protocolVersion":{"major":0},
   "sourceDirectory":"/home/code/cmake", "buildDirectory":"/tmp/testbuild",
   "generator":"Ninja"}
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]

which will result in a response type "reply"::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {"cookie":"zimtstern","inReplyTo":"handshake","type":"reply"}
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]

indicating that the server is ready for action.


Type "globalSettings"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This request can be sent after the initial handshake. It will return a
JSON structure with information on cmake state.

Example::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {"type":"globalSettings"}
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]

which will result in a response type "reply"::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {
    "buildDirectory": "/tmp/test-build",
    "capabilities": {
      "generators": [
        {
          "extraGenerators": [],
          "name": "Watcom WMake",
          "platformSupport": false,
          "toolsetSupport": false
        },
        <...>
      ],
      "serverMode": false,
      "version": {
        "isDirty": false,
        "major": 3,
        "minor": 6,
        "patch": 20160830,
        "string": "3.6.20160830-gd6abad",
        "suffix": "gd6abad"
      }
    },
    "checkSystemVars": false,
    "cookie": "",
    "extraGenerator": "",
    "generator": "Ninja",
    "debugOutput": false,
    "inReplyTo": "globalSettings",
    "sourceDirectory": "/home/code/cmake",
    "trace": false,
    "traceExpand": false,
    "type": "reply",
    "warnUninitialized": false,
    "warnUnused": false,
    "warnUnusedCli": true
  }
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]


Type "setGlobalSettings"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This request can be sent to change the global settings attributes. Unknown
attributes are going to be ignored. Read-only attributes reported by
"globalSettings" are all capabilities, buildDirectory, generator,
extraGenerator and sourceDirectory. Any attempt to set these will be ignored,
too.

All other settings will be changed.

The server will respond with an empty reply message or an error.

Example::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {"type":"setGlobalSettings","debugOutput":true}
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]

CMake will reply to this with::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {"inReplyTo":"setGlobalSettings","type":"reply"}
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]


Type "configure"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This request will configure a project for build.

To configure a build directory already containing cmake files, it is enough to
set "buildDirectory" via "setGlobalSettings". To create a fresh build directory
you also need to set "currentGenerator" and "sourceDirectory" via "setGlobalSettings"
in addition to "buildDirectory".

You may a list of strings to "configure" via the "cacheArguments" key. These
strings will be interpreted similar to command line arguments related to
cache handling that are passed to the cmake command line client.

Example::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {"type":"configure", "cacheArguments":["-Dsomething=else"]}
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]

CMake will reply like this (after reporting progress for some time)::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {"cookie":"","inReplyTo":"configure","type":"reply"}
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]


Type "compute"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This request will generate build system files in the build directory and
is only available after a project was successfully "configure"d.

Example::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {"type":"compute"}
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]

CMake will reply (after reporting progress information)::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {"cookie":"","inReplyTo":"compute","type":"reply"}
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]


Type "codemodel"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "codemodel" request can be used after a project was "compute"d successfully.

It will list the complete project structure as it is known to cmake.

The reply will contain a key "configurations", which will contain a list of
configuration objects. Configuration objects are used to destinquish between
different configurations the build directory might have enabled. While most
generators only support one configuration, others might support several.

Each configuration object can have the following keys:

"name"
  contains the name of the configuration. The name may be empty.
"projects"
  contains a list of project objects, one for each build project.

Project objects define one (sub-)project defined in the cmake build system.

Each project object can have the following keys:

"name"
  contains the (sub-)projects name.
"minimumCMakeVersion"
  contains the minimum cmake version allowed for this project, null if the
  project doesn't specify one.
"hasInstallRule"
  true if the project contains any install rules, false otherwise.
"sourceDirectory"
  contains the current source directory
"buildDirectory"
  contains the current build directory.
"targets"
  contains a list of build system target objects.

Target objects define individual build targets for a certain configuration.

Each target object can have the following keys:

"name"
  contains the name of the target.
"type"
  defines the type of build of the target. Possible values are
  "STATIC_LIBRARY", "MODULE_LIBRARY", "SHARED_LIBRARY", "OBJECT_LIBRARY",
  "EXECUTABLE", "UTILITY" and "INTERFACE_LIBRARY".
"fullName"
  contains the full name of the build result (incl. extensions, etc.).
"sourceDirectory"
  contains the current source directory.
"buildDirectory"
  contains the current build directory.
"isGeneratorProvided"
  true if the target is auto-created by a generator, false otherwise
"hasInstallRule"
  true if the target contains any install rules, false otherwise.
"installPaths"
  full path to the destination directories defined by target install rules.
"artifacts"
  with a list of build artifacts. The list is sorted with the most
  important artifacts first (e.g. a .DLL file is listed before a
  .PDB file on windows).
"linkerLanguage"
  contains the language of the linker used to produce the artifact.
"linkLibraries"
  with a list of libraries to link to. This value is encoded in the
  system's native shell format.
"linkFlags"
  with a list of flags to pass to the linker. This value is encoded in
  the system's native shell format.
"linkLanguageFlags"
  with the flags for a compiler using the linkerLanguage. This value is
  encoded in the system's native shell format.
"frameworkPath"
  with the framework path (on Apple computers). This value is encoded
  in the system's native shell format.
"linkPath"
  with the link path. This value is encoded in the system's native shell
  format.
"sysroot"
  with the sysroot path.
"fileGroups"
  contains the source files making up the target.

FileGroups are used to group sources using similar settings together.

Each fileGroup object may contain the following keys:

"language"
  contains the programming language used by all files in the group.
"compileFlags"
  with a string containing all the flags passed to the compiler
  when building any of the files in this group. This value is encoded in
  the system's native shell format.
"includePath"
  with a list of include paths. Each include path is an object
  containing a "path" with the actual include path and "isSystem" with a bool
  value informing whether this is a normal include or a system include. This
  value is encoded in the system's native shell format.
"defines"
  with a list of defines in the form "SOMEVALUE" or "SOMEVALUE=42". This
  value is encoded in the system's native shell format.
"sources"
  with a list of source files.

All file paths in the fileGroup are either absolute or relative to the
sourceDirectory of the target.

Example::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {"type":"codemodel"}
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]

CMake will reply::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {
    "configurations": [
      {
        "name": "",
        "projects": [
          {

                    "language": "C",
                    "sources": [ "fld_arg.c", <...> ]
                  }
                ],
                "fullName": "libcmForm.a",
                "linkerLanguage": "C",
                "name": "cmForm",
                "sourceDirectory": "/home/code/src/cmake/Source/CursesDialog/form",
                "type": "STATIC_LIBRARY"
              }
            ]
          },
          <...>
        ]
      }
    ],
    "cookie": "",
    "inReplyTo": "codemodel",
    "type": "reply"
  }
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]


Type "ctestInfo"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "ctestInfo" request can be used after a project was "compute"d successfully.

It will list the complete project test structure as it is known to cmake.

The reply will contain a key "configurations", which will contain a list of
configuration objects. Configuration objects are used to destinquish between
different configurations the build directory might have enabled. While most
generators only support one configuration, others might support several.

Each configuration object can have the following keys:

"name"
  contains the name of the configuration. The name may be empty.
"projects"
  contains a list of project objects, one for each build project.

Project objects define one (sub-)project defined in the cmake build system.

Each project object can have the following keys:

"name"
  contains the (sub-)projects name.
"ctestInfo"
  contains a list of test objects.

Each test object can have the following keys:

"ctestName"
  contains the name of the test.
"ctestCommand"
  contains the test command.
"properties"
  contains a list of test property objects.

Each test property object can have the following keys:

"key"
  contains the test property key.
"value"
  contains the test property value.


Type "cmakeInputs"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "cmakeInputs" requests will report files used by CMake as part
of the build system itself.

This request is only available after a project was successfully
"configure"d.

Example::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {"type":"cmakeInputs"}
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]

CMake will reply with the following information::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {"buildFiles":
    [
      {"isCMake":true,"isTemporary":false,"sources":["/usr/lib/cmake/...", ... ]},
      {"isCMake":false,"isTemporary":false,"sources":["CMakeLists.txt", ...]},
      {"isCMake":false,"isTemporary":true,"sources":["/tmp/build/CMakeFiles/...", ...]}
    ],
    "cmakeRootDirectory":"/usr/lib/cmake",
    "sourceDirectory":"/home/code/src/cmake",
    "cookie":"",
    "inReplyTo":"cmakeInputs",
    "type":"reply"
  }
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]

All file names are either relative to the top level source directory or
absolute.

The list of files which "isCMake" set to true are part of the cmake installation.

The list of files witch "isTemporary" set to true are part of the build directory
and will not survive the build directory getting cleaned out.


Type "cache"
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "cache" request will list the cached configuration values.

Example::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {"type":"cache"}
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]

CMake will respond with the following output::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {
    "cookie":"","inReplyTo":"cache","type":"reply",
    "cache":
    [
      {
        "key":"SOMEVALUE",
        "properties":
        {
          "ADVANCED":"1",
          "HELPSTRING":"This is not helpful"
        }
        "type":"STRING",
        "value":"TEST"}
    ]
  }
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]

The output can be limited to a list of keys by passing an array of key names
to the "keys" optional field of the "cache" request.


Type "fileSystemWatchers"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The server can watch the filesystem for changes. The "fileSystemWatchers"
command will report on the files and directories watched.

Example::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {"type":"fileSystemWatchers"}
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]

CMake will respond with the following output::

  [== "CMake Server" ==[
  {
    "cookie":"","inReplyTo":"fileSystemWatchers","type":"reply",
    "watchedFiles": [ "/absolute/path" ],
    "watchedDirectories": [ "/absolute" ]
  }
  ]== "CMake Server" ==]

Introduction
============

Packages provide dependency information to CMake based buildsystems.  Packages
are found with the :command:`find_package` command.  The result of
using ``find_package`` is either a set of :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` targets, or
a set of variables corresponding to build-relevant information.

Using Packages
==============

CMake provides direct support for two forms of packages,
`Config-file Packages`_ and `Find-module Packages`_.
Indirect support for ``pkg-config`` packages is also provided via
the :module:`FindPkgConfig` module.  In all cases, the basic form
of :command:`find_package` calls is the same:

.. code-block:: cmake

  find_package(Qt4 4.7.0 REQUIRED) # CMake provides a Qt4 find-module
  find_package(Qt5Core 5.1.0 REQUIRED) # Qt provides a Qt5 package config file.
  find_package(LibXml2 REQUIRED) # Use pkg-config via the LibXml2 find-module

In cases where it is known that a package configuration file is provided by
upstream, and only that should be used, the ``CONFIG`` keyword may be passed
to :command:`find_package`:

.. code-block:: cmake

  find_package(Qt5Core 5.1.0 CONFIG REQUIRED)
  find_package(Qt5Gui 5.1.0 CONFIG)

Similarly, the ``MODULE`` keyword says to use only a find-module:

.. code-block:: cmake

  find_package(Qt4 4.7.0 MODULE REQUIRED)

Specifying the type of package explicitly improves the error message shown to
the user if it is not found.

Both types of packages also support specifying components of a package,
either after the ``REQUIRED`` keyword:

.. code-block:: cmake

  find_package(Qt5 5.1.0 CONFIG REQUIRED Widgets Xml Sql)

or as a separate ``COMPONENTS`` list:

.. code-block:: cmake

  find_package(Qt5 5.1.0 COMPONENTS Widgets Xml Sql)

or as a separate ``OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS`` list:

.. code-block:: cmake

  find_package(Qt5 5.1.0 COMPONENTS Widgets
                         OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS Xml Sql
  )

Handling of ``COMPONENTS`` and ``OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS`` is defined by the
package.

By setting the :variable:`CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>` variable to
``TRUE``, the ``PackageName`` package will not be searched, and will always
be ``NOTFOUND``.

.. _`Config File Packages`:

Config-file Packages
--------------------

A config-file package is a set of files provided by upstreams for downstreams
to use. CMake searches in a number of locations for package configuration files, as
described in the :command:`find_package` documentation.  The most simple way for
a CMake user to tell :manual:`cmake(1)` to search in a non-standard prefix for
a package is to set the ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` cache variable.

Config-file packages are provided by upstream vendors as part of development
packages, that is, they belong with the header files and any other files
provided to assist downstreams in using the package.

A set of variables which provide package status information are also set
automatically when using a config-file package.  The ``<Package>_FOUND``
variable is set to true or false, depending on whether the package was
found.  The ``<Package>_DIR`` cache variable is set to the location of the
package configuration file.

Find-module Packages
--------------------

A find module is a file with a set of rules for finding the required pieces of
a dependency, primarily header files and libraries.  Typically, a find module
is needed when the upstream is not built with CMake, or is not CMake-aware
enough to otherwise provide a package configuration file.  Unlike a package configuration
file, it is not shipped with upstream, but is used by downstream to find the
files by guessing locations of files with platform-specific hints.

Unlike the case of an upstream-provided package configuration file, no single point
of reference identifies the package as being found, so the ``<Package>_FOUND``
variable is not automatically set by the :command:`find_package` command.  It
can still be expected to be set by convention however and should be set by
the author of the Find-module.  Similarly there is no ``<Package>_DIR`` variable,
but each of the artifacts such as library locations and header file locations
provide a separate cache variable.

See the :manual:`cmake-developer(7)` manual for more information about creating
Find-module files.

Package Layout
==============

A config-file package consists of a `Package Configuration File`_ and
optionally a `Package Version File`_ provided with the project distribution.

Package Configuration File
--------------------------

Consider a project ``Foo`` that installs the following files::

  <prefix>/include/foo-1.2/foo.h
  <prefix>/lib/foo-1.2/libfoo.a

It may also provide a CMake package configuration file::

  <prefix>/lib/cmake/foo-1.2/FooConfig.cmake

with content defining :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` targets, or defining variables, such
as:

.. code-block:: cmake

  # ...
  # (compute PREFIX relative to file location)
  # ...
  set(Foo_INCLUDE_DIRS ${PREFIX}/include/foo-1.2)
  set(Foo_LIBRARIES ${PREFIX}/lib/foo-1.2/libfoo.a)

If another project wishes to use ``Foo`` it need only to locate the ``FooConfig.cmake``
file and load it to get all the information it needs about package content
locations.  Since the package configuration file is provided by the package
installation it already knows all the file locations.

The :command:`find_package` command may be used to search for the package
configuration file.  This command constructs a set of installation prefixes
and searches under each prefix in several locations.  Given the name ``Foo``,
it looks for a file called ``FooConfig.cmake`` or ``foo-config.cmake``.
The full set of locations is specified in the :command:`find_package` command
documentation. One place it looks is::

 <prefix>/lib/cmake/Foo*/

where ``Foo*`` is a case-insensitive globbing expression.  In our example the
globbing expression will match ``<prefix>/lib/cmake/foo-1.2`` and the package
configuration file will be found.

Once found, a package configuration file is immediately loaded.  It, together
with a package version file, contains all the information the project needs to
use the package.

Package Version File
--------------------

When the :command:`find_package` command finds a candidate package configuration
file it looks next to it for a version file. The version file is loaded to test
whether the package version is an acceptable match for the version requested.
If the version file claims compatibility the configuration file is accepted.
Otherwise it is ignored.

The name of the package version file must match that of the package configuration
file but has either ``-version`` or ``Version`` appended to the name before
the ``.cmake`` extension.  For example, the files::

 <prefix>/lib/cmake/foo-1.3/foo-config.cmake
 <prefix>/lib/cmake/foo-1.3/foo-config-version.cmake

and::

 <prefix>/lib/cmake/bar-4.2/BarConfig.cmake
 <prefix>/lib/cmake/bar-4.2/BarConfigVersion.cmake

are each pairs of package configuration files and corresponding package version
files.

When the :command:`find_package` command loads a version file it first sets the
following variables:

``PACKAGE_FIND_NAME``
 The <package> name

``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION``
 Full requested version string

``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR``
 Major version if requested, else 0

``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR``
 Minor version if requested, else 0

``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH``
 Patch version if requested, else 0

``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK``
 Tweak version if requested, else 0

``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COUNT``
 Number of version components, 0 to 4

The version file must use these variables to check whether it is compatible or
an exact match for the requested version and set the following variables with
results:

``PACKAGE_VERSION``
 Full provided version string

``PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT``
 True if version is exact match

``PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE``
 True if version is compatible

``PACKAGE_VERSION_UNSUITABLE``
 True if unsuitable as any version

Version files are loaded in a nested scope so they are free to set any variables
they wish as part of their computation. The find_package command wipes out the
scope when the version file has completed and it has checked the output
variables. When the version file claims to be an acceptable match for the
requested version the find_package command sets the following variables for
use by the project:

``<package>_VERSION``
 Full provided version string

``<package>_VERSION_MAJOR``
 Major version if provided, else 0

``<package>_VERSION_MINOR``
 Minor version if provided, else 0

``<package>_VERSION_PATCH``
 Patch version if provided, else 0

``<package>_VERSION_TWEAK``
 Tweak version if provided, else 0

``<package>_VERSION_COUNT``
 Number of version components, 0 to 4

The variables report the version of the package that was actually found.
The ``<package>`` part of their name matches the argument given to the
:command:`find_package` command.

.. _`Creating Packages`:

Creating Packages
=================

Usually, the upstream depends on CMake itself and can use some CMake facilities
for creating the package files. Consider an upstream which provides a single
shared library:

.. code-block:: cmake

  project(UpstreamLib)

  set(CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR ON)
  set(CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE ON)

  set(Upstream_VERSION 3.4.1)

  include(GenerateExportHeader)

  add_library(ClimbingStats SHARED climbingstats.cpp)
  generate_export_header(ClimbingStats)
  set_property(TARGET ClimbingStats PROPERTY VERSION ${Upstream_VERSION})
  set_property(TARGET ClimbingStats PROPERTY SOVERSION 3)
  set_property(TARGET ClimbingStats PROPERTY
    INTERFACE_ClimbingStats_MAJOR_VERSION 3)
  set_property(TARGET ClimbingStats APPEND PROPERTY
    COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING ClimbingStats_MAJOR_VERSION
  )

  install(TARGETS ClimbingStats EXPORT ClimbingStatsTargets
    LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
    ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib
    RUNTIME DESTINATION bin
    INCLUDES DESTINATION include
  )
  install(
    FILES
      climbingstats.h
      "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/climbingstats_export.h"
    DESTINATION
      include
    COMPONENT
      Devel
  )

  include(CMakePackageConfigHelpers)
  write_basic_package_version_file(
    "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/ClimbingStats/ClimbingStatsConfigVersion.cmake"
    VERSION ${Upstream_VERSION}
    COMPATIBILITY AnyNewerVersion
  )

  export(EXPORT ClimbingStatsTargets
    FILE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/ClimbingStats/ClimbingStatsTargets.cmake"
    NAMESPACE Upstream::
  )
  configure_file(cmake/ClimbingStatsConfig.cmake
    "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/ClimbingStats/ClimbingStatsConfig.cmake"
    COPYONLY
  )

  set(ConfigPackageLocation lib/cmake/ClimbingStats)
  install(EXPORT ClimbingStatsTargets
    FILE
      ClimbingStatsTargets.cmake
    NAMESPACE
      Upstream::
    DESTINATION
      ${ConfigPackageLocation}
  )
  install(
    FILES
      cmake/ClimbingStatsConfig.cmake
      "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/ClimbingStats/ClimbingStatsConfigVersion.cmake"
    DESTINATION
      ${ConfigPackageLocation}
    COMPONENT
      Devel
  )

The :module:`CMakePackageConfigHelpers` module provides a macro for creating
a simple ``ConfigVersion.cmake`` file.  This file sets the version of the
package.  It is read by CMake when :command:`find_package` is called to
determine the compatibility with the requested version, and to set some
version-specific variables ``<Package>_VERSION``, ``<Package>_VERSION_MAJOR``,
``<Package>_VERSION_MINOR`` etc.  The :command:`install(EXPORT)` command is
used to export the targets in the ``ClimbingStatsTargets`` export-set, defined
previously by the :command:`install(TARGETS)` command. This command generates
the ``ClimbingStatsTargets.cmake`` file to contain :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED`
targets, suitable for use by downstreams and arranges to install it to
``lib/cmake/ClimbingStats``.  The generated ``ClimbingStatsConfigVersion.cmake``
and a ``cmake/ClimbingStatsConfig.cmake`` are installed to the same location,
completing the package.

The generated :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` targets have appropriate properties set
to define their :ref:`usage requirements <Target Usage Requirements>`, such as
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`,
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` and other relevant built-in
``INTERFACE_`` properties.  The ``INTERFACE`` variant of user-defined
properties listed in :prop_tgt:`COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING` and
other :ref:`Compatible Interface Properties` are also propagated to the
generated :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` targets.  In the above case,
``ClimbingStats_MAJOR_VERSION`` is defined as a string which must be
compatible among the dependencies of any depender.  By setting this custom
defined user property in this version and in the next version of
``ClimbingStats``, :manual:`cmake(1)` will issue a diagnostic if there is an
attempt to use version 3 together with version 4.  Packages can choose to
employ such a pattern if different major versions of the package are designed
to be incompatible.

A ``NAMESPACE`` with double-colons is specified when exporting the targets
for installation.  This convention of double-colons gives CMake a hint that
the name is an :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` target when it is used by downstreams
with the :command:`target_link_libraries` command.  This way, CMake can
issue a diagnostic if the package providing it has not yet been found.

In this case, when using :command:`install(TARGETS)` the ``INCLUDES DESTINATION``
was specified.  This causes the ``IMPORTED`` targets to have their
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` populated with the ``include``
directory in the :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.  When the ``IMPORTED``
target is used by downstream, it automatically consumes the entries from
that property.

Creating a Package Configuration File
-------------------------------------

In this case, the ``ClimbingStatsConfig.cmake`` file could be as simple as:

.. code-block:: cmake

  include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/ClimbingStatsTargets.cmake")

As this allows downstreams to use the ``IMPORTED`` targets.  If any macros
should be provided by the ``ClimbingStats`` package, they should
be in a separate file which is installed to the same location as the
``ClimbingStatsConfig.cmake`` file, and included from there.

This can also be extended to cover dependencies:

.. code-block:: cmake

  # ...
  add_library(ClimbingStats SHARED climbingstats.cpp)
  generate_export_header(ClimbingStats)

  find_package(Stats 2.6.4 REQUIRED)
  target_link_libraries(ClimbingStats PUBLIC Stats::Types)

As the ``Stats::Types`` target is a ``PUBLIC`` dependency of ``ClimbingStats``,
downstreams must also find the ``Stats`` package and link to the ``Stats::Types``
library.  The ``Stats`` package should be found in the ``ClimbingStatsConfig.cmake``
file to ensure this.  The ``find_dependency`` macro from the
:module:`CMakeFindDependencyMacro` helps with this by propagating
whether the package is ``REQUIRED``, or ``QUIET`` etc.  All ``REQUIRED``
dependencies of a package should be found in the ``Config.cmake`` file:

.. code-block:: cmake

  include(CMakeFindDependencyMacro)
  find_dependency(Stats 2.6.4)

  include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/ClimbingStatsTargets.cmake")
  include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/ClimbingStatsMacros.cmake")

The ``find_dependency`` macro also sets ``ClimbingStats_FOUND`` to ``False`` if
the dependency is not found, along with a diagnostic that the ``ClimbingStats``
package can not be used without the ``Stats`` package.

If ``COMPONENTS`` are specified when the downstream uses :command:`find_package`,
they are listed in the ``<Package>_FIND_COMPONENTS`` variable. If a particular
component is non-optional, then the ``<Package>_FIND_REQUIRED_<comp>`` will
be true. This can be tested with logic in the package configuration file:

.. code-block:: cmake

  include(CMakeFindDependencyMacro)
  find_dependency(Stats 2.6.4)

  include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/ClimbingStatsTargets.cmake")
  include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/ClimbingStatsMacros.cmake")

  set(_supported_components Plot Table)

  foreach(_comp ${ClimbingStats_FIND_COMPONENTS})
    if (NOT ";${_supported_components};" MATCHES _comp)
      set(ClimbingStats_FOUND False)
      set(ClimbingStats_NOT_FOUND_MESSAGE "Unsupported component: ${_comp}")
    endif()
    include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/ClimbingStats${_comp}Targets.cmake")
  endforeach()

Here, the ``ClimbingStats_NOT_FOUND_MESSAGE`` is set to a diagnosis that the package
could not be found because an invalid component was specified.  This message
variable can be set for any case where the ``_FOUND`` variable is set to ``False``,
and will be displayed to the user.

Creating a Package Configuration File for the Build Tree
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :command:`export(EXPORT)` command creates an :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` targets
definition file which is specific to the build-tree, and is not relocatable.
This can similarly be used with a suitable package configuration file and
package version file to define a package for the build tree which may be used
without installation.  Consumers of the build tree can simply ensure that the
:variable:`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` contains the build directory, or set the
``ClimbingStats_DIR`` to ``<build_dir>/ClimbingStats`` in the cache.

.. _`Creating Relocatable Packages`:

Creating Relocatable Packages
-----------------------------

A relocatable package must not reference absolute paths of files on
the machine where the package is built that will not exist on the
machines where the package may be installed.

Packages created by :command:`install(EXPORT)` are designed to be relocatable,
using paths relative to the location of the package itself.  When defining
the interface of a target for ``EXPORT``, keep in mind that the include
directories should be specified as relative paths which are relative to the
:variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`:

.. code-block:: cmake

  target_include_directories(tgt INTERFACE
    # Wrong, not relocatable:
    $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/TgtName>
  )

  target_include_directories(tgt INTERFACE
    # Ok, relocatable:
    $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/TgtName>
  )

The ``$<INSTALL_PREFIX>``
:manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` may be used as
a placeholder for the install prefix without resulting in a non-relocatable
package.  This is necessary if complex generator expressions are used:

.. code-block:: cmake

  target_include_directories(tgt INTERFACE
    # Ok, relocatable:
    $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:$<$<CONFIG:Debug>:$<INSTALL_PREFIX>/include/TgtName>>
  )

This also applies to paths referencing external dependencies.
It is not advisable to populate any properties which may contain
paths, such as :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` and
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`, with paths relevant to dependencies.
For example, this code may not work well for a relocatable package:

.. code-block:: cmake

  target_link_libraries(ClimbingStats INTERFACE
    ${Foo_LIBRARIES} ${Bar_LIBRARIES}
    )
  target_include_directories(ClimbingStats INTERFACE
    "$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:${Foo_INCLUDE_DIRS};${Bar_INCLUDE_DIRS}>"
    )

The referenced variables may contain the absolute paths to libraries
and include directories **as found on the machine the package was made on**.
This would create a package with hard-coded paths to dependencies and not
suitable for relocation.

Ideally such dependencies should be used through their own
:ref:`IMPORTED targets <Imported Targets>` that have their own
:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION` and usage requirement properties
such as :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` populated
appropriately.  Those imported targets may then be used with
the :command:`target_link_libraries` command for ``ClimbingStats``:

.. code-block:: cmake

  target_link_libraries(ClimbingStats INTERFACE Foo::Foo Bar::Bar)

With this approach the package references its external dependencies
only through the names of :ref:`IMPORTED targets <Imported Targets>`.
When a consumer uses the installed package, the consumer will run the
appropriate :command:`find_package` commands (via the ``find_dependency``
macro described above) to find the dependencies and populate the
imported targets with appropriate paths on their own machine.

Unfortunately many :manual:`modules <cmake-modules(7)>` shipped with
CMake do not yet provide :ref:`IMPORTED targets <Imported Targets>`
because their development pre-dated this approach.  This may improve
incrementally over time.  Workarounds to create relocatable packages
using such modules include:

* When building the package, specify each ``Foo_LIBRARY`` cache
  entry as just a library name, e.g. ``-DFoo_LIBRARY=foo``.  This
  tells the corresponding find module to populate the ``Foo_LIBRARIES``
  with just ``foo`` to ask the linker to search for the library
  instead of hard-coding a path.

* Or, after installing the package content but before creating the
  package installation binary for redistribution, manually replace
  the absolute paths with placeholders for substitution by the
  installation tool when the package is installed.

.. _`Package Registry`:

Package Registry
================

CMake provides two central locations to register packages that have
been built or installed anywhere on a system:

* `User Package Registry`_
* `System Package Registry`_

The registries are especially useful to help projects find packages in
non-standard install locations or directly in their own build trees.
A project may populate either the user or system registry (using its own
means, see below) to refer to its location.
In either case the package should store at the registered location a
`Package Configuration File`_ (``<package>Config.cmake``) and optionally a
`Package Version File`_ (``<package>ConfigVersion.cmake``).

The :command:`find_package` command searches the two package registries
as two of the search steps specified in its documentation.  If it has
sufficient permissions it also removes stale package registry entries
that refer to directories that do not exist or do not contain a matching
package configuration file.

.. _`User Package Registry`:

User Package Registry
---------------------

The User Package Registry is stored in a per-user location.
The :command:`export(PACKAGE)` command may be used to register a project
build tree in the user package registry.  CMake currently provides no
interface to add install trees to the user package registry.  Installers
must be manually taught to register their packages if desired.

On Windows the user package registry is stored in the Windows registry
under a key in ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER``.

A ``<package>`` may appear under registry key::

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Kitware\CMake\Packages\<package>

as a ``REG_SZ`` value, with arbitrary name, that specifies the directory
containing the package configuration file.

On UNIX platforms the user package registry is stored in the user home
directory under ``~/.cmake/packages``.  A ``<package>`` may appear under
the directory::

  ~/.cmake/packages/<package>

as a file, with arbitrary name, whose content specifies the directory
containing the package configuration file.

.. _`System Package Registry`:

System Package Registry
-----------------------

The System Package Registry is stored in a system-wide location.
CMake currently provides no interface to add to the system package registry.
Installers must be manually taught to register their packages if desired.

On Windows the system package registry is stored in the Windows registry
under a key in ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE``.  A ``<package>`` may appear under
registry key::

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Kitware\CMake\Packages\<package>

as a ``REG_SZ`` value, with arbitrary name, that specifies the directory
containing the package configuration file.

There is no system package registry on non-Windows platforms.

.. _`Disabling the Package Registry`:

Disabling the Package Registry
------------------------------

In some cases using the Package Registries is not desirable. CMake
allows one to disable them using the following variables:

 * :variable:`CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY` disables the
   :command:`export(PACKAGE)` command.
 * :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY` disables the
   User Package Registry in all the :command:`find_package` calls.
 * :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY` disables
   the System Package Registry in all the :command:`find_package` calls.

Package Registry Example
------------------------

A simple convention for naming package registry entries is to use content
hashes.  They are deterministic and unlikely to collide
(:command:`export(PACKAGE)` uses this approach).
The name of an entry referencing a specific directory is simply the content
hash of the directory path itself.

If a project arranges for package registry entries to exist, such as::

 > reg query HKCU\Software\Kitware\CMake\Packages\MyPackage
 HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Kitware\CMake\Packages\MyPackage
  45e7d55f13b87179bb12f907c8de6fc4 REG_SZ c:/Users/Me/Work/lib/cmake/MyPackage
  7b4a9844f681c80ce93190d4e3185db9 REG_SZ c:/Users/Me/Work/MyPackage-build

or::

 $ cat ~/.cmake/packages/MyPackage/7d1fb77e07ce59a81bed093bbee945bd
 /home/me/work/lib/cmake/MyPackage
 $ cat ~/.cmake/packages/MyPackage/f92c1db873a1937f3100706657c63e07
 /home/me/work/MyPackage-build

then the ``CMakeLists.txt`` code:

.. code-block:: cmake

  find_package(MyPackage)

will search the registered locations for package configuration files
(``MyPackageConfig.cmake``).  The search order among package registry
entries for a single package is unspecified and the entry names
(hashes in this example) have no meaning.  Registered locations may
contain package version files (``MyPackageConfigVersion.cmake``) to
tell :command:`find_package` whether a specific location is suitable
for the version requested.

Package Registry Ownership
--------------------------

Package registry entries are individually owned by the project installations
that they reference.  A package installer is responsible for adding its own
entry and the corresponding uninstaller is responsible for removing it.

The :command:`export(PACKAGE)` command populates the user package registry
with the location of a project build tree.  Build trees tend to be deleted by
developers and have no "uninstall" event that could trigger removal of their
entries.  In order to keep the registries clean the :command:`find_package`
command automatically removes stale entries it encounters if it has sufficient
permissions.  CMake provides no interface to remove an entry referencing an
existing build tree once :command:`export(PACKAGE)` has been invoked.
However, if the project removes its package configuration file from the build
tree then the entry referencing the location will be considered stale.

Introduction
============

This manual is intended for reference by developers modifying the CMake
source tree itself, and by those authoring externally-maintained modules.

Adding Compile Features
=======================

CMake reports an error if a compiler whose features are known does not report
support for a particular requested feature.  A compiler is considered to have
known features if it reports support for at least one feature.

When adding a new compile feature to CMake, it is therefore necessary to list
support for the feature for all CompilerIds which already have one or more
feature supported, if the new feature is available for any version of the
compiler.

When adding the first supported feature to a particular CompilerId, it is
necessary to list support for all features known to cmake (See
:variable:`CMAKE_C_COMPILE_FEATURES` and
:variable:`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILE_FEATURES` as appropriate), where available for
the compiler.  Ensure that the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_STANDARD_DEFAULT`` is set to
the computed internal variable ``CMAKE_<LANG>_STANDARD_COMPUTED_DEFAULT``
for compiler versions which should be supported.

It is sensible to record the features for the most recent version of a
particular CompilerId first, and then work backwards.  It is sensible to
try to create a continuous range of versions of feature releases of the
compiler.  Gaps in the range indicate incorrect features recorded for
intermediate releases.

Generally, features are made available for a particular version if the
compiler vendor documents availability of the feature with that
version.  Note that sometimes partially implemented features appear to
be functional in previous releases (such as ``cxx_constexpr`` in GNU 4.6,
though availability is documented in GNU 4.7), and sometimes compiler vendors
document availability of features, though supporting infrastructure is
not available (such as ``__has_feature(cxx_generic_lambdas)`` indicating
non-availability in Clang 3.4, though it is documented as available, and
fixed in Clang 3.5).  Similar cases for other compilers and versions
need to be investigated when extending CMake to support them.

When a vendor releases a new version of a known compiler which supports
a previously unsupported feature, and there are already known features for
that compiler, the feature should be listed as supported in CMake for
that version of the compiler as soon as reasonably possible.

Standard-specific/compiler-specific variables such
``CMAKE_CXX98_COMPILE_FEATURES`` are deliberately not documented.  They
only exist for the compiler-specific implementation of adding the ``-std``
compile flag for compilers which need that.

Help
====

The ``Help`` directory contains CMake help manual source files.
They are written using the `reStructuredText`_ markup syntax and
processed by `Sphinx`_ to generate the CMake help manuals.

.. _`reStructuredText`: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/introduction.html
.. _`Sphinx`: http://sphinx-doc.org

Markup Constructs
-----------------

In addition to using Sphinx to generate the CMake help manuals, we
also use a C++-implemented document processor to print documents for
the ``--help-*`` command-line help options.  It supports a subset of
reStructuredText markup.  When authoring or modifying documents,
please verify that the command-line help looks good in addition to the
Sphinx-generated html and man pages.

The command-line help processor supports the following constructs
defined by reStructuredText, Sphinx, and a CMake extension to Sphinx.

..
 Note: This list must be kept consistent with the cmRST implementation.

CMake Domain directives
 Directives defined in the `CMake Domain`_ for defining CMake
 documentation objects are printed in command-line help output as
 if the lines were normal paragraph text with interpretation.

CMake Domain interpreted text roles
 Interpreted text roles defined in the `CMake Domain`_ for
 cross-referencing CMake documentation objects are replaced by their
 link text in command-line help output.  Other roles are printed
 literally and not processed.

``code-block`` directive
 Add a literal code block without interpretation.  The command-line
 help processor prints the block content without the leading directive
 line and with common indentation replaced by one space.

``include`` directive
 Include another document source file.  The command-line help
 processor prints the included document inline with the referencing
 document.

literal block after ``::``
 A paragraph ending in ``::`` followed by a blank line treats
 the following indented block as literal text without interpretation.
 The command-line help processor prints the ``::`` literally and
 prints the block content with common indentation replaced by one
 space.

``note`` directive
 Call out a side note.  The command-line help processor prints the
 block content as if the lines were normal paragraph text with
 interpretation.

``parsed-literal`` directive
 Add a literal block with markup interpretation.  The command-line
 help processor prints the block content without the leading
 directive line and with common indentation replaced by one space.

``productionlist`` directive
 Render context-free grammar productions.  The command-line help
 processor prints the block content as if the lines were normal
 paragraph text with interpretation.

``replace`` directive
 Define a ``|substitution|`` replacement.
 The command-line help processor requires a substitution replacement
 to be defined before it is referenced.

``|substitution|`` reference
 Reference a substitution replacement previously defined by
 the ``replace`` directive.  The command-line help processor
 performs the substitution and replaces all newlines in the
 replacement text with spaces.

``toctree`` directive
 Include other document sources in the Table-of-Contents
 document tree.  The command-line help processor prints
 the referenced documents inline as part of the referencing
 document.

Inline markup constructs not listed above are printed literally in the
command-line help output.  We prefer to use inline markup constructs that
look correct in source form, so avoid use of \\-escapes in favor of inline
literals when possible.

Explicit markup blocks not matching directives listed above are removed from
command-line help output.  Do not use them, except for plain ``..`` comments
that are removed by Sphinx too.

Note that nested indentation of blocks is not recognized by the
command-line help processor.  Therefore:

* Explicit markup blocks are recognized only when not indented
  inside other blocks.

* Literal blocks after paragraphs ending in ``::`` but not
  at the top indentation level may consume all indented lines
  following them.

Try to avoid these cases in practice.

CMake Domain
------------

CMake adds a `Sphinx Domain`_ called ``cmake``, also called the
"CMake Domain".  It defines several "object" types for CMake
documentation:

``command``
 A CMake language command.

``generator``
 A CMake native build system generator.
 See the :manual:`cmake(1)` command-line tool's ``-G`` option.

``manual``
 A CMake manual page, like this :manual:`cmake-developer(7)` manual.

``module``
 A CMake module.
 See the :manual:`cmake-modules(7)` manual
 and the :command:`include` command.

``policy``
 A CMake policy.
 See the :manual:`cmake-policies(7)` manual
 and the :command:`cmake_policy` command.

``prop_cache, prop_dir, prop_gbl, prop_sf, prop_inst, prop_test, prop_tgt``
 A CMake cache, directory, global, source file, installed file, test,
 or target property, respectively.  See the :manual:`cmake-properties(7)`
 manual and the :command:`set_property` command.

``variable``
 A CMake language variable.
 See the :manual:`cmake-variables(7)` manual
 and the :command:`set` command.

Documentation objects in the CMake Domain come from two sources.
First, the CMake extension to Sphinx transforms every document named
with the form ``Help/<type>/<file-name>.rst`` to a domain object with
type ``<type>``.  The object name is extracted from the document title,
which is expected to be of the form::

 <object-name>
 -------------

and to appear at or near the top of the ``.rst`` file before any other
lines starting in a letter, digit, or ``<``.  If no such title appears
literally in the ``.rst`` file, the object name is the ``<file-name>``.
If a title does appear, it is expected that ``<file-name>`` is equal
to ``<object-name>`` with any ``<`` and ``>`` characters removed.

Second, the CMake Domain provides directives to define objects inside
other documents:

.. code-block:: rst

 .. command:: <command-name>

  This indented block documents <command-name>.

 .. variable:: <variable-name>

  This indented block documents <variable-name>.

Object types for which no directive is available must be defined using
the first approach above.

.. _`Sphinx Domain`: http://sphinx-doc.org/domains.html

Cross-References
----------------

Sphinx uses reStructuredText interpreted text roles to provide
cross-reference syntax.  The `CMake Domain`_ provides for each
domain object type a role of the same name to cross-reference it.
CMake Domain roles are inline markup of the forms::

 :type:`name`
 :type:`text <name>`

where ``type`` is the domain object type and ``name`` is the
domain object name.  In the first form the link text will be
``name`` (or ``name()`` if the type is ``command``) and in
the second form the link text will be the explicit ``text``.
For example, the code:

.. code-block:: rst

 * The :command:`list` command.
 * The :command:`list(APPEND)` sub-command.
 * The :command:`list() command <list>`.
 * The :command:`list(APPEND) sub-command <list>`.
 * The :variable:`CMAKE_VERSION` variable.
 * The :prop_tgt:`OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>` target property.

produces:

* The :command:`list` command.
* The :command:`list(APPEND)` sub-command.
* The :command:`list() command <list>`.
* The :command:`list(APPEND) sub-command <list>`.
* The :variable:`CMAKE_VERSION` variable.
* The :prop_tgt:`OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>` target property.

Note that CMake Domain roles differ from Sphinx and reStructuredText
convention in that the form ``a<b>``, without a space preceding ``<``,
is interpreted as a name instead of link text with an explicit target.
This is necessary because we use ``<placeholders>`` frequently in
object names like ``OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>``.  The form ``a <b>``,
with a space preceding ``<``, is still interpreted as a link text
with an explicit target.

Style
-----

Style: Section Headers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When marking section titles, make the section decoration line as long as
the title text.  Use only a line below the title, not above. For
example:

.. code-block:: rst

  Title Text
  ----------

Capitalize the first letter of each non-minor word in the title.

The section header underline character hierarchy is

* ``#``: Manual group (part) in the master document
* ``*``: Manual (chapter) title
* ``=``: Section within a manual
* ``-``: Subsection or `CMake Domain`_ object document title
* ``^``: Subsubsection or `CMake Domain`_ object document section
* ``"``: Paragraph or `CMake Domain`_ object document subsection

Style: Whitespace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use two spaces for indentation.  Use two spaces between sentences in
prose.

Style: Line Length
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prefer to restrict the width of lines to 75-80 columns.  This is not a
hard restriction, but writing new paragraphs wrapped at 75 columns
allows space for adding minor content without significant re-wrapping of
content.

Style: Prose
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use American English spellings in prose.

Style: Starting Literal Blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prefer to mark the start of literal blocks with ``::`` at the end of
the preceding paragraph. In cases where the following block gets
a ``code-block`` marker, put a single ``:`` at the end of the preceding
paragraph.

Style: CMake Command Signatures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Command signatures should be marked up as plain literal blocks, not as
cmake ``code-blocks``.

Signatures are separated from preceding content by a section header.
That is, use:

.. code-block:: rst

  ... preceding paragraph.

  Normal Libraries
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  ::

    add_library(<lib> ...)

  This signature is used for ...

Signatures of commands should wrap optional parts with square brackets,
and should mark list of optional arguments with an ellipsis (``...``).
Elements of the signature which are specified by the user should be
specified with angle brackets, and may be referred to in prose using
``inline-literal`` syntax.

Style: Boolean Constants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use "``OFF``" and "``ON``" for boolean values which can be modified by
the user, such as :prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`. Such properties
may be "enabled" and "disabled". Use "``True``" and "``False``" for
inherent values which can't be modified after being set, such as the
:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` property of a build target.

Style: Inline Literals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mark up references to keywords in signatures, file names, and other
technical terms with ``inline-literal`` syntax, for example:

.. code-block:: rst

  If ``WIN32`` is used with :command:`add_executable`, the
  :prop_tgt:`WIN32_EXECUTABLE` target property is enabled. That command
  creates the file ``<name>.exe`` on Windows.

Style: Cross-References
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mark up linkable references as links, including repeats.
An alternative, which is used by wikipedia
(`<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:REPEATLINK>`_),
is to link to a reference only once per article. That style is not used
in CMake documentation.

Style: Referencing CMake Concepts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If referring to a concept which corresponds to a property, and that
concept is described in a high-level manual, prefer to link to the
manual section instead of the property. For example:

.. code-block:: rst

  This command creates an :ref:`Imported Target <Imported Targets>`.

instead of:

.. code-block:: rst

  This command creates an :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` target.

The latter should be used only when referring specifically to the
property.

References to manual sections are not automatically created by creating
a section, but code such as:

.. code-block:: rst

  .. _`Imported Targets`:

creates a suitable anchor.  Use an anchor name which matches the name
of the corresponding section.  Refer to the anchor using a
cross-reference with specified text.

Imported Targets need the ``IMPORTED`` term marked up with care in
particular because the term may refer to a command keyword
(``IMPORTED``), a target property (:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED`), or a
concept (:ref:`Imported Targets`).

Where a property, command or variable is related conceptually to others,
by for example, being related to the buildsystem description, generator
expressions or Qt, each relevant property, command or variable should
link to the primary manual, which provides high-level information.  Only
particular information relating to the command should be in the
documentation of the command.

Style: Referencing CMake Domain Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When referring to `CMake Domain`_ objects such as properties, variables,
commands etc, prefer to link to the target object and follow that with
the type of object it is.  For example:

.. code-block:: rst

  Set the :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` target property to ``ON``.

Instead of

.. code-block:: rst

  Set the target property :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` to ``ON``.

The ``policy`` directive is an exception, and the type us usually
referred to before the link:

.. code-block:: rst

  If policy :prop_tgt:`CMP0022` is set to ``NEW`` the behavior is ...

However, markup self-references with ``inline-literal`` syntax.
For example, within the :command:`add_executable` command
documentation, use

.. code-block:: rst

  ``add_executable``

not

.. code-block:: rst

  :command:`add_executable`

which is used elsewhere.

Modules
=======

The ``Modules`` directory contains CMake-language ``.cmake`` module files.

Module Documentation
--------------------

To document CMake module ``Modules/<module-name>.cmake``, modify
``Help/manual/cmake-modules.7.rst`` to reference the module in the
``toctree`` directive, in sorted order, as::

 /module/<module-name>

Then add the module document file ``Help/module/<module-name>.rst``
containing just the line::

 .. cmake-module:: ../../Modules/<module-name>.cmake

The ``cmake-module`` directive will scan the module file to extract
reStructuredText markup from comment blocks that start in ``.rst:``.
At the top of ``Modules/<module-name>.cmake``, begin with the following
license notice:

.. code-block:: cmake

 # Distributed under the OSI-approved BSD 3-Clause License.  See accompanying
 # file Copyright.txt or https://cmake.org/licensing for details.

After this notice, add a *BLANK* line.  Then, add documentation using
a :ref:`Line Comment` block of the form:

.. code-block:: cmake

 #.rst:
 # <module-name>
 # -------------
 #
 # <reStructuredText documentation of module>

or a :ref:`Bracket Comment` of the form:

::

 #[[.rst:
 <module-name>
 -------------

 <reStructuredText documentation of module>
 #]]

Any number of ``=`` may be used in the opening and closing brackets
as long as they match.  Content on the line containing the closing
bracket is excluded if and only if the line starts in ``#``.

Additional such ``.rst:`` comments may appear anywhere in the module file.
All such comments must start with ``#`` in the first column.

For example, a ``Modules/Findxxx.cmake`` module may contain:

::

 # Distributed under the OSI-approved BSD 3-Clause License.  See accompanying
 # file Copyright.txt or https://cmake.org/licensing for details.

 #.rst:
 # FindXxx
 # -------
 #
 # This is a cool module.
 # This module does really cool stuff.
 # It can do even more than you think.
 #
 # It even needs two paragraphs to tell you about it.
 # And it defines the following variables:
 #
 # * VAR_COOL: this is great isn't it?
 # * VAR_REALLY_COOL: cool right?

 <code>

 #[========================================[.rst:
 .. command:: xxx_do_something

  This command does something for Xxx::

   xxx_do_something(some arguments)
 #]========================================]
 macro(xxx_do_something)
   <code>
 endmacro()

Test the documentation formatting by running
``cmake --help-module <module-name>``, and also by enabling the
``SPHINX_HTML`` and ``SPHINX_MAN`` options to build the documentation.
Edit the comments until generated documentation looks satisfactory.  To
have a .cmake file in this directory NOT show up in the modules
documentation, simply leave out the ``Help/module/<module-name>.rst``
file and the ``Help/manual/cmake-modules.7.rst`` toctree entry.

.. _`Find Modules`:

Find Modules
------------

A "find module" is a ``Modules/Find<package>.cmake`` file to be loaded
by the :command:`find_package` command when invoked for ``<package>``.

The primary task of a find module is to determine whether a package
exists on the system, set the ``<package>_FOUND`` variable to reflect
this and provide any variables, macros and imported targets required to
use the package.  A find module is useful in cases where an upstream
library does not provide a
:ref:`config file package <Config File Packages>`.

The traditional approach is to use variables for everything, including
libraries and executables: see the `Standard Variable Names`_ section
below.  This is what most of the existing find modules provided by CMake
do.

The more modern approach is to behave as much like
:ref:`config file packages <Config File Packages>` files as possible, by
providing :ref:`imported target <Imported targets>`.  This has the advantage
of propagating :ref:`Target Usage Requirements` to consumers.

In either case (or even when providing both variables and imported
targets), find modules should provide backwards compatibility with old
versions that had the same name.

A FindFoo.cmake module will typically be loaded by the command::

  find_package(Foo [major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]]
               [EXACT] [QUIET] [REQUIRED]
               [[COMPONENTS] [components...]]
               [OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS components...]
               [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])

See the :command:`find_package` documentation for details on what
variables are set for the find module.  Most of these are dealt with by
using :module:`FindPackageHandleStandardArgs`.

Briefly, the module should only locate versions of the package
compatible with the requested version, as described by the
``Foo_FIND_VERSION`` family of variables.  If ``Foo_FIND_QUIETLY`` is
set to true, it should avoid printing messages, including anything
complaining about the package not being found.  If ``Foo_FIND_REQUIRED``
is set to true, the module should issue a ``FATAL_ERROR`` if the package
cannot be found.  If neither are set to true, it should print a
non-fatal message if it cannot find the package.

Packages that find multiple semi-independent parts (like bundles of
libraries) should search for the components listed in
``Foo_FIND_COMPONENTS`` if it is set , and only set ``Foo_FOUND`` to
true if for each searched-for component ``<c>`` that was not found,
``Foo_FIND_REQUIRED_<c>`` is not set to true.  The ``HANDLE_COMPONENTS``
argument of ``find_package_handle_standard_args()`` can be used to
implement this.

If ``Foo_FIND_COMPONENTS`` is not set, which modules are searched for
and required is up to the find module, but should be documented.

For internal implementation, it is a generally accepted convention that
variables starting with underscore are for temporary use only.

Like all modules, find modules should be properly documented.  To add a
module to the CMake documentation, follow the steps in the `Module
Documentation`_ section above.



.. _`CMake Developer Standard Variable Names`:

Standard Variable Names
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a ``FindXxx.cmake`` module that takes the approach of setting
variables (either instead of or in addition to creating imported
targets), the following variable names should be used to keep things
consistent between find modules.  Note that all variables start with
``Xxx_`` to make sure they do not interfere with other find modules; the
same consideration applies to macros, functions and imported targets.

``Xxx_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  The final set of include directories listed in one variable for use by
  client code.  This should not be a cache entry.

``Xxx_LIBRARIES``
  The libraries to link against to use Xxx. These should include full
  paths.  This should not be a cache entry.

``Xxx_DEFINITIONS``
  Definitions to use when compiling code that uses Xxx. This really
  shouldn't include options such as ``-DHAS_JPEG`` that a client
  source-code file uses to decide whether to ``#include <jpeg.h>``

``Xxx_EXECUTABLE``
  Where to find the Xxx tool.

``Xxx_Yyy_EXECUTABLE``
  Where to find the Yyy tool that comes with Xxx.

``Xxx_LIBRARY_DIRS``
  Optionally, the final set of library directories listed in one
  variable for use by client code.  This should not be a cache entry.

``Xxx_ROOT_DIR``
  Where to find the base directory of Xxx.

``Xxx_VERSION_Yy``
  Expect Version Yy if true. Make sure at most one of these is ever true.

``Xxx_WRAP_Yy``
  If False, do not try to use the relevant CMake wrapping command.

``Xxx_Yy_FOUND``
  If False, optional Yy part of Xxx system is not available.

``Xxx_FOUND``
  Set to false, or undefined, if we haven't found, or don't want to use
  Xxx.

``Xxx_NOT_FOUND_MESSAGE``
  Should be set by config-files in the case that it has set
  ``Xxx_FOUND`` to FALSE.  The contained message will be printed by the
  :command:`find_package` command and by
  ``find_package_handle_standard_args()`` to inform the user about the
  problem.

``Xxx_RUNTIME_LIBRARY_DIRS``
  Optionally, the runtime library search path for use when running an
  executable linked to shared libraries.  The list should be used by
  user code to create the ``PATH`` on windows or ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` on
  UNIX.  This should not be a cache entry.

``Xxx_VERSION``
  The full version string of the package found, if any.  Note that many
  existing modules provide ``Xxx_VERSION_STRING`` instead.

``Xxx_VERSION_MAJOR``
  The major version of the package found, if any.

``Xxx_VERSION_MINOR``
  The minor version of the package found, if any.

``Xxx_VERSION_PATCH``
  The patch version of the package found, if any.

The following names should not usually be used in CMakeLists.txt files, but
are typically cache variables for users to edit and control the
behaviour of find modules (like entering the path to a library manually)

``Xxx_LIBRARY``
  The path of the Xxx library (as used with :command:`find_library`, for
  example).

``Xxx_Yy_LIBRARY``
  The path of the Yy library that is part of the Xxx system. It may or
  may not be required to use Xxx.

``Xxx_INCLUDE_DIR``
  Where to find headers for using the Xxx library.

``Xxx_Yy_INCLUDE_DIR``
  Where to find headers for using the Yy library of the Xxx system.

To prevent users being overwhelmed with settings to configure, try to
keep as many options as possible out of the cache, leaving at least one
option which can be used to disable use of the module, or locate a
not-found library (e.g. ``Xxx_ROOT_DIR``).  For the same reason, mark
most cache options as advanced.  For packages which provide both debug
and release binaries, it is common to create cache variables with a
``_LIBRARY_<CONFIG>`` suffix, such as ``Foo_LIBRARY_RELEASE`` and
``Foo_LIBRARY_DEBUG``.

While these are the standard variable names, you should provide
backwards compatibility for any old names that were actually in use.
Make sure you comment them as deprecated, so that no-one starts using
them.



A Sample Find Module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will describe how to create a simple find module for a library
``Foo``.

The first thing that is needed is a license notice.

.. code-block:: cmake

 # Distributed under the OSI-approved BSD 3-Clause License.  See accompanying
 # file Copyright.txt or https://cmake.org/licensing for details.

Next we need module documentation.  CMake's documentation system requires you
to follow the license notice with a blank line and then with a documentation
marker and the name of the module.  You should follow this with a simple
statement of what the module does.

.. code-block:: cmake

  #.rst:
  # FindFoo
  # -------
  #
  # Finds the Foo library
  #

More description may be required for some packages.  If there are
caveats or other details users of the module should be aware of, you can
add further paragraphs below this.  Then you need to document what
variables and imported targets are set by the module, such as

.. code-block:: cmake

  # This will define the following variables::
  #
  #   Foo_FOUND    - True if the system has the Foo library
  #   Foo_VERSION  - The version of the Foo library which was found
  #
  # and the following imported targets::
  #
  #   Foo::Foo   - The Foo library

If the package provides any macros, they should be listed here, but can
be documented where they are defined.  See the `Module
Documentation`_ section above for more details.

Now the actual libraries and so on have to be found.  The code here will
obviously vary from module to module (dealing with that, after all, is the
point of find modules), but there tends to be a common pattern for libraries.

First, we try to use ``pkg-config`` to find the library.  Note that we
cannot rely on this, as it may not be available, but it provides a good
starting point.

.. code-block:: cmake

  find_package(PkgConfig)
  pkg_check_modules(PC_Foo QUIET Foo)

This should define some variables starting ``PC_Foo_`` that contain the
information from the ``Foo.pc`` file.

Now we need to find the libraries and include files; we use the
information from ``pkg-config`` to provide hints to CMake about where to
look.

.. code-block:: cmake

  find_path(Foo_INCLUDE_DIR
    NAMES foo.h
    PATHS ${PC_Foo_INCLUDE_DIRS}
    PATH_SUFFIXES Foo
  )
  find_library(Foo_LIBRARY
    NAMES foo
    PATHS ${PC_Foo_LIBRARY_DIRS}
  )

If you have a good way of getting the version (from a header file, for
example), you can use that information to set ``Foo_VERSION`` (although
note that find modules have traditionally used ``Foo_VERSION_STRING``,
so you may want to set both).  Otherwise, attempt to use the information
from ``pkg-config``

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(Foo_VERSION ${PC_Foo_VERSION})

Now we can use :module:`FindPackageHandleStandardArgs` to do most of the
rest of the work for us

.. code-block:: cmake

  include(FindPackageHandleStandardArgs)
  find_package_handle_standard_args(Foo
    FOUND_VAR Foo_FOUND
    REQUIRED_VARS
      Foo_LIBRARY
      Foo_INCLUDE_DIR
    VERSION_VAR Foo_VERSION
  )

This will check that the ``REQUIRED_VARS`` contain values (that do not
end in ``-NOTFOUND``) and set ``Foo_FOUND`` appropriately.  It will also
cache those values.  If ``Foo_VERSION`` is set, and a required version
was passed to :command:`find_package`, it will check the requested version
against the one in ``Foo_VERSION``.  It will also print messages as
appropriate; note that if the package was found, it will print the
contents of the first required variable to indicate where it was found.

At this point, we have to provide a way for users of the find module to
link to the library or libraries that were found.  There are two
approaches, as discussed in the `Find Modules`_ section above.  The
traditional variable approach looks like

.. code-block:: cmake

  if(Foo_FOUND)
    set(Foo_LIBRARIES ${Foo_LIBRARY})
    set(Foo_INCLUDE_DIRS ${Foo_INCLUDE_DIR})
    set(Foo_DEFINITIONS ${PC_Foo_CFLAGS_OTHER})
  endif()

If more than one library was found, all of them should be included in
these variables (see the `Standard Variable Names`_ section for more
information).

When providing imported targets, these should be namespaced (hence the
``Foo::`` prefix); CMake will recognize that values passed to
:command:`target_link_libraries` that contain ``::`` in their name are
supposed to be imported targets (rather than just library names), and
will produce appropriate diagnostic messages if that target does not
exist (see policy :policy:`CMP0028`).

.. code-block:: cmake

  if(Foo_FOUND AND NOT TARGET Foo::Foo)
    add_library(Foo::Foo UNKNOWN IMPORTED)
    set_target_properties(Foo::Foo PROPERTIES
      IMPORTED_LOCATION "${Foo_LIBRARY}"
      INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS "${PC_Foo_CFLAGS_OTHER}"
      INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES "${Foo_INCLUDE_DIR}"
    )
  endif()

One thing to note about this is that the ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` and
similar properties should only contain information about the target itself, and
not any of its dependencies.  Instead, those dependencies should also be
targets, and CMake should be told that they are dependencies of this target.
CMake will then combine all the necessary information automatically.

The type of the :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` target created in the
:command:`add_library` command can always be specified as ``UNKNOWN``
type.  This simplifies the code in cases where static or shared variants may
be found, and CMake will determine the type by inspecting the files.

If the library is available with multiple configurations, the
:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS` target property should also be
populated:

.. code-block:: cmake

  if(Foo_FOUND)
    if (NOT TARGET Foo::Foo)
      add_library(Foo::Foo UNKNOWN IMPORTED)
    endif()
    if (Foo_LIBRARY_RELEASE)
      set_property(TARGET Foo::Foo APPEND PROPERTY
        IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS RELEASE
      )
      set_target_properties(Foo::Foo PROPERTIES
        IMPORTED_LOCATION_RELEASE "${Foo_LIBRARY_RELEASE}"
      )
    endif()
    if (Foo_LIBRARY_DEBUG)
      set_property(TARGET Foo::Foo APPEND PROPERTY
        IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS DEBUG
      )
      set_target_properties(Foo::Foo PROPERTIES
        IMPORTED_LOCATION_DEBUG "${Foo_LIBRARY_DEBUG}"
      )
    endif()
    set_target_properties(Foo::Foo PROPERTIES
      INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS "${PC_Foo_CFLAGS_OTHER}"
      INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES "${Foo_INCLUDE_DIR}"
    )
  endif()

The ``RELEASE`` variant should be listed first in the property
so that the variant is chosen if the user uses a configuration which is
not an exact match for any listed ``IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS``.

Most of the cache variables should be hidden in the ``ccmake`` interface unless
the user explicitly asks to edit them.

.. code-block:: cmake

  mark_as_advanced(
    Foo_INCLUDE_DIR
    Foo_LIBRARY
  )

If this module replaces an older version, you should set compatibility variables
to cause the least disruption possible.

.. code-block:: cmake

  # compatibility variables
  set(Foo_VERSION_STRING ${Foo_VERSION})
CMake 3.10 Release Notes
************************

.. only:: html

  .. contents::

Changes made since CMake 3.9 include the following.

New Features
============

Platforms
---------

* The `flang`_ Fortran compiler is now supported, with compiler id ``Flang``.

* A new minimal platform file for ``Midipix`` was added.

* Support for the MSVC ARM64 architecture was added.
  Visual Studio 2017 Update 4 and above offer an ARM64 toolchain.

* Support for the IAR ARM Compiler was improved.

.. _`flang`: https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang

Generators
----------

* The :ref:`Makefile Generators` and the :generator:`Ninja` generator learned
  to add compiler launcher tools like ccache along with the compiler for the
  ``CUDA`` language (``C`` and ``CXX`` were supported previously).  See the
  :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` variable and
  :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` target property for details.

* The :generator:`CodeBlocks` extra generator learned to optionally exclude
  files from outside the project root directory from the generated project.
  See the :variable:`CMAKE_CODEBLOCKS_EXCLUDE_EXTERNAL_FILES` variable.

Commands
--------

* The :command:`cmake_host_system_information` command learned more keys
  to get information about the processor capabilities and the host OS
  version.

* The :command:`configure_file` command learned to support indented
  ``#  cmakedefine`` and ``#  cmakedefine01``. Spaces and/or tabs between
  the ``#`` character and the ``cmakedefine``/``cmakedefine01`` words
  are now understood and preserved in the output.

* The :command:`execute_process` command gained a ``RESULTS_VARIABLE``
  option to collect a list of results from all children in a pipeline
  of processes when multiple ``COMMAND`` arguments are given.

* The :command:`include_guard` command was introduced to allow guarding
  CMake scripts from being included more than once. The command supports
  ``DIRECTORY`` and ``GLOBAL`` options to adjust the corresponding include guard
  scope. If no options given, include guard is similar to basic variable-based
  check.

* The :command:`string` command learned a new ``PREPEND`` subcommand.

* The :command:`string(TIMESTAMP)` command now supports ``%A``
  for full weekday name and ``%B`` for full month name.

Variables
---------

* A :variable:`CMAKE_DIRECTORY_LABELS` variable was added to specify
  labels for all tests in a directory.

Properties
----------

* A :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_CPPCHECK` target property and supporting
  :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_CPPCHECK` variable were introduced to tell
  the :ref:`Makefile Generators` and the :generator:`Ninja` generator to
  run ``cppcheck`` with the compiler for ``C`` and ``CXX`` languages.

* A :prop_dir:`LABELS` directory property was added to specify labels
  for all targets and tests in a directory.

* A :prop_dir:`TEST_INCLUDE_FILES` directory property was added to
  list any number of files to be included when running tests with
  :manual:`ctest(1)`.  This generalizes the :prop_dir:`TEST_INCLUDE_FILE`
  property.

* The :prop_tgt:`VS_DOTNET_REFERENCEPROP_<refname>_TAG_<tagname>`
  target property was added to support custom XML tags for reference
  assemblies in C# targets.

* Source file properties :prop_sf:`VS_SHADER_OUTPUT_HEADER_FILE` and
  :prop_sf:`VS_SHADER_VARIABLE_NAME` have been added to specify more
  details of ``.hlsl`` sources with :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`.

Modules
-------

* The :module:`FindCurses` module gained a ``CURSES_NEED_WIDE`` option
  to request the wide-character variant.

* The :module:`FindEXPAT` module now provides imported targets.

* The :module:`FindFreetype` module now provides imported targets.

* :module:`FindMPI` gained a number of new features, including:

  * Language-specific components have been added to the module.
  * Many more MPI environments are now supported.
  * The environmental support for Fortran has been improved.
  * A user now has fine-grained control over the MPI selection process,
    including passing custom parameters to the MPI compiler.
  * The version of the implemented MPI standard is now being exposed.
  * MPI-2 C++ bindings can now be detected and also suppressed if so desired.
  * The available Fortran bindings are now being detected and verified.
  * Various MPI-3 information can be requested, including the library version
    and Fortran capabilities of the individual bindings.
  * Statically linked MPI implementations are supported.

* A :module:`FindOpenACC` module was added to detect compiler support
  for OpenACC.  Currently only supports PGI, GNU and Cray compilers.

* The :module:`FindOpenGL` module gained support for GLVND on Linux.

* The :module:`FindOpenMP` module gained support for
  language-specific components.

* A :module:`FindPatch` module was added to find the ``patch``
  command-line executable.

* The :module:`FindProtobuf` module :command:`protobuf_generate_cpp` command
  gained a ``DESCRIPTORS`` option to generate descriptor files.

* The :module:`GoogleTest` module gained a new command
  :command:`gtest_discover_tests` implementing dynamic (build-time) test
  discovery.  Unlike the source parsing approach, dynamic discovery executes
  the test (in 'list available tests' mode) at build time to discover tests.
  This is robust against unusual ways of labeling tests, provides much better
  support for advanced features such as parameterized tests, and does not
  require re-running CMake to discover added or removed tests within a test
  executable.  Note that a breaking change was made in CMake 3.10.3 to address
  an ambiguity of the ``TIMEOUT`` keyword (see :ref:`Release Notes 3.10.3`).

* The :module:`InstallRequiredSystemLibraries` module gained support
  for installing Intel compiler runtimes.

Autogen
-------

* When using :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` or :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` with a
  multi configuration generator (e.g. :generator:`Xcode`),
  included ``*.moc``,  ``moc_*.cpp`` and ``ui_*.h`` files are generated in
  ``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/include_<CONFIG>`` instead of
  ``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/include``.

* When using :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` or :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`,
  source files that are :prop_sf:`GENERATED` will be processed as well.
  They were ignored by :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`
  in earlier releases.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0071`.

* When using :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC`, CMake searches for the strings ``Q_OBJECT``,
  ``Q_GADGET`` or ``Q_NAMESPACE`` in a source file to determine if it needs
  to be ``moc`` processed.  The new :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES`
  variable and :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES` target property may be set
  to register additional strings (macro names) to search for.

* When using :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC`, the new
  :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES` variable and
  :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES` target property specify whether
  to enable or disable the generation of the compiler pre definitions file
  ``moc_predefs.h``.

CTest
-----

* A :variable:`CTEST_LABELS_FOR_SUBPROJECTS` CTest module variable and CTest
  script variable were added to specify a list of labels that should be
  treated as subprojects by CDash. To use this value in both the CTest module
  and the ctest command line :ref:`Dashboard Client` mode (e.g. ``ctest -S``)
  set it in the ``CTestConfig.cmake`` config file.

CPack
-----

* CPack gained a ``FREEBSD`` generator for FreeBSD ``pkg(8)``, configured
  by the :module:`CPackFreeBSD` module.

* The CPack ``DEB`` generator, configured by the :module:`CPackDeb` module,
  was enabled on Windows.  While not fully featured (due to the lack of
  external UNIX tools) this will allow building basic cross-platform Debian
  packages.

* The :module:`CPackDeb` module learned to set package release version in
  ``Version`` info property.
  See the :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_RELEASE` variable.

* The :module:`CPackDeb` module learned more strict package version checking
  that complies with Debian rules.

* The :module:`CPackIFW` module :command:`cpack_ifw_configure_component` and
  :command:`cpack_ifw_configure_component_group` commands gained a new
  ``REPLACES`` and ``CHECKABLE`` options.

* The :module:`CPackIFW` module gained new
  :variable:`CPACK_IFW_PACKAGE_FILE_EXTENSION` variable to customize
  target binary format.

* The :module:`CPackIFW` module gained new
  :variable:`CPACK_IFW_REPOSITORIES_DIRECTORIES` variable to specify
  additional repositories dirs that will be used to resolve and
  repack dependent components. This feature is only available when
  using QtIFW 3.1 or later.

* Modules :module:`CPackRPM` and :module:`CPackDeb` learned to set package epoch
  version.
  See :variable:`CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_EPOCH` and
  :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_EPOCH` variables.

Other
-----

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-E`` mode gained support for ``sha1sum``,
  ``sha224sum``, ``sha256sum``, ``sha384sum``, and ``sha512sum``.

* The graphviz output now distinguishes among the different dependency types
  ``PUBLIC``, ``PRIVATE`` and ``INTERFACE`` and represents them in the output
  graph as solid, dashed and dotted edges.

Deprecated and Removed Features
===============================

* Support for building CMake itself with C++98 compilers was dropped.
  CMake is now implemented using C++11.

* Support for building CMake on HP-UX has been dropped pending better
  support for C++11 and a port of libuv.  See `CMake Issue 17137`_.
  Use CMake 3.9 or lower instead for HP-UX support.

.. _`CMake Issue 17137`: https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/17137

Other Changes
=============

* On FreeBSD the C++ compiler named ``c++`` is now the preferred default.

* The :command:`file(GENERATE)` command now interprets relative paths
  given to its ``OUTPUT`` and ``INPUT`` arguments with respect to the
  caller's current binary and source directories, respectively.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0070`.

* The :command:`get_filename_component` ``PROGRAM`` mode semantics
  have been revised to not tolerate unquoted spaces in the path
  to the program while also accepting arguments.  While technically
  incompatible with the old behavior, it is expected that behavior
  under typical use cases with properly-quoted command-lines has
  not changed.

Updates
=======

Changes made since CMake 3.10.0 include the following.

3.10.1
------

* The :manual:`cmake-server(7)` ``codemodel`` response ``crossReferences``
  field added by 3.10.0 has been dropped due to excessive memory usage.
  Another approach will be needed to provide backtrace information.

.. _`Release Notes 3.10.3`:

3.10.3
------

* CMake 3.10.1 added a ``TIMEOUT`` option to :command:`gtest_discover_tests`
  from the :module:`GoogleTest` module.  That keyword clashed with the
  ``TIMEOUT`` test property, which is one of the common properties that
  would be set with the command's ``PROPERTIES`` keyword, usually leading
  to legal but unintended behavior.  The keyword was changed to
  ``DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT`` in CMake 3.10.3 to address this problem.  The
  ambiguous behavior of the :command:`gtest_discover_tests` command's
  ``TIMEOUT`` keyword in 3.10.1 and 3.10.2 has not been preserved.
CMake 3.2 Release Notes
***********************

.. only:: html

  .. contents::

Changes made since CMake 3.1 include the following.

New Features
============

Syntax
------

* CMake learned to support unicode characters
  :ref:`encoded as UTF-8 <CMake Language Encoding>`
  on Windows.  This was already supported on platforms whose
  system APIs accept UTF-8 encoded strings.
  Unicode characters may now be used in CMake code, paths to
  source files, configured files such as ``.h.in`` files, and
  other files read and written by CMake.  Note that because CMake
  interoperates with many other tools, there may still be some
  limitations when using certain unicode characters.

Commands
--------

* The :command:`add_custom_command` and :command:`add_custom_target`
  commands learned a new ``BYPRODUCTS`` option to specify files
  produced as side effects of the custom commands.  These are not
  outputs because they do not always have to be newer than inputs.

* The :command:`add_custom_command` and :command:`add_custom_target`
  commands learned a new ``USES_TERMINAL`` option to request that
  the command be given direct access to the terminal if possible.
  The :generator:`Ninja` generator will places such commands in the
  ``console`` :prop_gbl:`pool <JOB_POOLS>`.  Build targets provided by CMake
  that are meant for individual interactive use, such as ``install``, are now
  placed in this pool.

* A new :command:`continue` command was added that can be called inside loop
  contexts to end the current iteration and start the next one at the top of
  the loop block.

* The :command:`file(LOCK)` subcommand was created to allow CMake
  processes to synchronize through file and directory locks.

* The :command:`file(STRINGS)` now supports UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE,
  UTF-32LE, UTF-32BE as ``ENCODING`` options.

* The :command:`install(EXPORT)` command now works with an absolute
  ``DESTINATION`` even if targets in the export set are installed
  with a destination or :ref:`usage requirements <Target Usage Requirements>`
  specified relative to the install prefix.  The value of the
  :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable is hard-coded into the installed
  export file as the base for relative references.

* The :command:`try_compile` command source file signature now honors
  link flags (e.g. :variable:`CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS`) in the generated
  test project.  See policy :policy:`CMP0056`.

* The :command:`try_run` command learned to honor the ``LINK_LIBRARIES``
  option just as :command:`try_compile` already does.

* The :command:`file(GENERATE)` command now generates the output file with
  the same permissions as the input file if set.

* The :command:`file(GENERATE)` command can now generate files which are
  used as source files for buildsystem targets.  Generated files
  automatically get their :prop_sf:`GENERATED` property set to ``TRUE``.

Variables
---------

* The :variable:`CMAKE_MATCH_COUNT` variable was introduced to record the
  number of matches made in the last regular expression matched in an
  :command:`if` command or a :command:`string` command.

Properties
----------

* An :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_API_MIN` target property was introduced to
  specify the minimum version to be targeted by the toolchain.

* A :prop_sf:`VS_SHADER_FLAGS` source file property was added to specify
  additional shader flags to ``.hlsl`` files, for the Visual Studio
  generators.

Modules
-------

* The :module:`ExternalData` module learned to support
  :ref:`Custom Fetch Scripts <ExternalData Custom Fetch Scripts>`.
  This allows projects to specify custom ``.cmake`` scripts for
  fetching data objects during the build.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module learned options to create
  independent external project step targets that do not depend
  on the builtin steps.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module :command:`ExternalProject_Add`
  command learned a new ``CMAKE_CACHE_DEFAULT_ARGS`` option to
  initialize cache values in the external project without setting
  them on future builds.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module :command:`ExternalProject_Add`
  command learned a new ``TEST_EXCLUDE_FROM_MAIN`` option to exclude
  tests from the main build.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module :command:`ExternalProject_Add`
  command learned a new ``UPDATE_DISCONNECTED`` option to avoid
  automatically updating the source tree checkout from version control.

* The :module:`FindCUDA` module learned about the ``cusolver``
  library in CUDA 7.0.

* The :module:`FindGit` module learned to find the ``git`` command-line tool
  that comes with GitHub for Windows installed in user home directories.

* A :module:`FindGSL` module was introduced to find the
  GNU Scientific Library.

* A :module:`FindIntl` module was introduced to find the
  Gettext ``libintl`` library.

* The :module:`FindLATEX` module learned to support components.

* The :module:`FindMPI` module learned to find MS-MPI on Windows.

* The :module:`FindOpenSSL` module now reports ``crypto`` and ``ssl``
  libraries separately in ``OPENSSL_CRYPTO_LIBRARY`` and
  ``OPENSSL_SSL_LIBRARY``, respectively, to allow applications to
  link to one without the other.

* The :module:`WriteCompilerDetectionHeader` module learned to
  create a define for portability of the ``cxx_thread_local`` feature.
  The define expands to either the C++11 ``thread_local`` keyword, or a
  pre-standardization compiler-specific equivalent, as appropriate.

* The :module:`WriteCompilerDetectionHeader` module learned to create
  multiple output files per compiler and per language, instead of creating
  one large file.

CTest
-----

* The :command:`ctest_coverage` command learned to support Delphi coverage.

* The :command:`ctest_coverage` command learned to support Javascript coverage.

* The :module:`CTestCoverageCollectGCOV` module was introduced as an
  alternative to the :command:`ctest_coverage` command for collecting
  ``gcov`` results for submission to CDash.

CPack
-----

* The :module:`CPackRPM` module learned options to set per-component
  descriptions and summaries.  See the
  :variable:`CPACK_RPM_<component>_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION` and
  :variable:`CPACK_RPM_<component>_PACKAGE_SUMMARY` variables.

* The :module:`CPackRPM` module learned options to specify
  requirements for pre- and post-install scripts.  See the
  :variable:`CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES_PRE` and
  :variable:`CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES_POST` variables.

* The :module:`CPackRPM` module learned options to specify
  requirements for pre- and post-uninstall scripts.  See the
  :variable:`CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES_PREUN` and
  :variable:`CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES_POSTUN` variables.

* The :module:`CPackRPM` module learned a new
  :variable:`CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_PREFIX` variable to
  specify a component-specific value to use instead of
  :variable:`CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX`.

* The :module:`CPackRPM` module learned a new
  :variable:`CPACK_RPM_RELOCATION_PATHS` variable to
  specify multiple relocation prefixes for a single rpm package.

Other
-----

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-E tar`` command now supports creating
  ``.xz``-compressed archives with the ``J`` flag.

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-E tar`` command learned a new
  ``--files-from=<file>`` option to specify file names using
  lines in a file to overcome command-line length limits.

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-E tar`` command learned a new
  ``--mtime=<date>`` option to specify the modification time
  recorded in tarball entries.

* The :manual:`Compile Features <cmake-compile-features(7)>` functionality
  is now aware of features supported by more compilers, including:

  * Apple Clang (``AppleClang``) for Xcode versions 4.4 though 6.1.
  * GNU compiler versions 4.4 through 5.0 on UNIX and Apple (``GNU``).
  * Microsoft Visual Studio (``MSVC``) for versions 2010 through 2015.
  * Oracle SolarisStudio (``SunPro``) version 12.4.

* The :ref:`Qt AUTORCC` feature now tracks files listed in ``.qrc`` files
  as dependencies. If an input file to the ``rcc`` tool is changed, the tool
  is automatically re-run.

New Diagnostics
===============

* The :command:`break` command now rejects calls outside of a loop
  context or that pass arguments to the command.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0055`.

Deprecated and Removed Features
===============================

* Files written in the :manual:`cmake-language(7)`, such as
  ``CMakeLists.txt`` or ``*.cmake`` files, are now expected to be
  encoded as UTF-8.  If files are already ASCII, they will be
  compatible.  If files were in a different encoding, including
  Latin 1, they will need to be converted.

* The :module:`FindOpenGL` module no longer explicitly searches
  for any dependency on X11 libraries with the :module:`FindX11`
  module.  Such dependencies should not need to be explicit.
  Applications using X11 APIs themselves should find and link
  to X11 libraries explicitly.

* The implementation of CMake now relies on some C++ compiler features which
  are not supported by some older compilers.  As a result, those old compilers
  can no longer be used to build CMake itself.  CMake continues to be able to
  generate Makefiles and project files for users of those old compilers
  however.  Compilers known to no longer be capable of building CMake are:

  * Visual Studio 6 and 7.0 -- superseded by VisualStudio 7.1 and newer.
  * GCC 2.95 -- superseded by GCC 3 and newer compilers.
  * Borland compilers -- superseded by other Windows compilers.
  * Compaq compilers -- superseded by other compilers.
  * SGI compilers -- IRIX was dropped as a host platform.

Other Changes
=============

* On Windows and OS X, commands supporting network communication
  via ``https``, such as :command:`file(DOWNLOAD)`,
  :command:`file(UPLOAD)`, and :command:`ctest_submit`, now support
  SSL/TLS even when CMake is not built against OpenSSL.
  The Windows or OS X native SSL/TLS implementation is used by default.
  OS-configured certificate authorities will be trusted automatically.

  On other platforms, when CMake is built with OpenSSL, these
  commands now search for OS-configured certificate authorities
  in a few ``/etc`` paths to be trusted automatically.

* On OS X with Makefile and Ninja generators, when a compiler is found
  in ``/usr/bin`` it is now mapped to the corresponding compiler inside
  the Xcode application folder, if any.  This allows such build
  trees to continue to work with their original compiler even when
  ``xcode-select`` switches to a different Xcode installation.

* The Visual Studio generators now write solution and project
  files in UTF-8 instead of Windows-1252.  Windows-1252 supported
  Latin 1 languages such as those found in North and South America
  and Western Europe.  With UTF-8, additional languages are now
  supported.

* The :generator:`Xcode` generator no longer requires a value for
  the :variable:`CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM` variable to be located up front.
  It now locates ``xcodebuild`` when needed at build time.

* When building CMake itself using SolarisStudio 12, the default ``libCStd``
  standard library is not sufficient to build CMake.  The SolarisStudio
  distribution supports compiler options to use ``STLPort4`` or ``libstdc++``.
  An appropriate option to select the standard library is now added
  automatically when building CMake with SolarisStudio compilers.
CMake 3.7 Release Notes
***********************

.. only:: html

  .. contents::

Changes made since CMake 3.6 include the following.

New Features
============

Platforms
---------

  Fortran when using a ``ninja`` tool that has the necessary features.
  See generator documentation for details.

* The :generator:`Ninja` generator learned to produce phony targets
  of the form ``sub/dir/{test,install,package}`` to drive the build
  of a subdirectory installation, test or packaging target.
  This is equivalent to ``cd sub/dir; make {test,install,package}``
  with :ref:`Makefile Generators`.

* The :generator:`Visual Studio 15 2017` generator was added.  This is
  experimental and based on "Visual Studio 2017 RC" because this version
  of VS has not been released.

* :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above learned to
  place ``.natvis`` source files into VS project files properly.

* The :generator:`Xcode` generator's rudimentary Swift language support
  learned to honor a new :variable:`CMAKE_Swift_LANGUAGE_VERSION` variable
  to tell Xcode what version of Swift is used by the source.

  architecture.  See the :prop_gbl:`FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS` global
  property.

* The :command:`find_package` command gained the possibility of
  sorting compatible libraries by ``NAME`` or by ``NATURAL`` sorting by
  setting the two new variables :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER`
  and :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_DIRECTION`.

* The :command:`if` command gained new boolean comparison operations
  ``LESS_EQUAL``, ``GREATER_EQUAL``, ``STRLESS_EQUAL``, ``STRGREATER_EQUAL``,
  ``VERSION_LESS_EQUAL``, and ``VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL``.

  commands gained support for the ``%a`` and ``%b`` placeholders.
  These are the abbreviated weekday and month names.

* The :command:`try_compile` command source file signature now honors
  configuration-specific flags (e.g. :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG`)
  in the generated test project.  Previously only the default such flags
  for the current toolchain were used.  See policy :policy:`CMP0066`.

Variables

  the sorting direction the :command:`find_package` command.

* :variable:`Toolchain files <CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>` may now set a
  :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_INIT` variable to initialize the
  :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` cache entry the first time a language is
  enabled in a build tree.

* :variable:`Toolchain files <CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>` may now set
  :variable:`CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT`,
  :variable:`CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT`, and
  :variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT` variables to initialize the
  :variable:`CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS`,
  :variable:`CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS`, and
  :variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS` cache entries the first time
  a language is enabled in a build tree.

  for use by external CMake projects.  See the ``install_jar_exports``
  and ``export_jars`` functions.

CTest
-----

* CTest now supports test fixtures through the new :prop_test:`FIXTURES_SETUP`,
  :prop_test:`FIXTURES_CLEANUP` and :prop_test:`FIXTURES_REQUIRED` test
  properties. When using regular expressions or ``--rerun-failed`` to limit
  the tests to be run, a fixture's setup and cleanup tests will automatically
  be added to the execution set if any test requires that fixture.

* The :command:`ctest_configure`, :command:`ctest_build`,
  :command:`ctest_test`, :command:`ctest_coverage`, and :command:`ctest_upload`

  of a custom title and description for the root feature element.

Other
-----

* :manual:`cmake(1)` gained a ``-E capabilities`` option to provide a
  machine-readable (JSON) description of the capabilities of the
  cmake tool (available generators, etc.).

* A new :manual:`cmake-server(7)` mode was added to provide semantic
  information about a CMake-generated buildsystem to clients through
  a JSON protocol.  Currently all protocols are experimental and subject
  to change.

* :manual:`ccmake(1)` learned to support vim-like navigation bindings.

* :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` gained a button to open the generated project file
  for :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` and the :generator:`Xcode` generator.

CMake 3.6 Release Notes
***********************

.. only:: html

  .. contents::

Changes made since CMake 3.5 include the following.

New Features
============

Generators
----------

* The :generator:`Ninja` generator learned to produce phony targets
  of the form ``sub/dir/all`` to drive the build of a subdirectory.
  This is equivalent to ``cd sub/dir; make all`` with
  :ref:`Makefile Generators`.

* The :generator:`Ninja` generator now includes system header files in build
  dependencies to ensure correct re-builds when system packages are updated.

* The :generator:`Visual Studio 14 2015` generator learned to support the
  Clang/C2 toolsets, e.g. with the ``-T v140_clang_3_7`` option.
  This feature is experimental.

Commands
--------

* The :command:`add_custom_command` and :command:`add_custom_target` commands
  learned how to use the :prop_tgt:`CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR` executable
  target property.

* The :command:`install` command learned a new ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` option
  to leave installation rules out of the default installation.

* The :command:`list` command gained a ``FILTER`` sub-command to filter
  list elements by regular expression.

* The :command:`string(TIMESTAMP)` and :command:`file(TIMESTAMP)`
  commands gained support for the ``%s`` placeholder.  This is
  the number of seconds since the UNIX Epoch.

Variables
---------

* A :variable:`CMAKE_DEPENDS_IN_PROJECT_ONLY` variable was introduced
  to tell :ref:`Makefile Generators` to limit dependency scanning only
  to files in the project source and build trees.

* A new :variable:`CMAKE_HOST_SOLARIS` variable was introduced to
  indicate when CMake is running on an Oracle Solaris host.

* A :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` variable was
  added for use by toolchain files to specify system include directories
  to be appended to all compiler command lines.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_STANDARD_LIBRARIES` variable is now documented.
  It is intended for use by toolchain files to specify system libraries to be
  added to all linker command lines.

* A :variable:`CMAKE_NINJA_OUTPUT_PATH_PREFIX` variable was introduced
  to tell the :generator:`Ninja` generator to configure the generated
  ``build.ninja`` file for use as a ``subninja``.

* A :variable:`CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_PLATFORM_VARIABLES` variable was
  added for use by toolchain files to specify platform-specific
  variables that must be propagated by the :command:`try_compile`
  command into test projects.

* A :variable:`CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE` variable was added
  to optionally tell the :command:`try_compile` command to build
  a static library instead of an executable.  This is useful for
  cross-compiling toolchains that cannot link binaries without
  custom flags or scripts.

Properties
----------

* A :prop_tgt:`DEPLOYMENT_REMOTE_DIRECTORY` target property was introduced
  to tell the :generator:`Visual Studio 9 2008` and
  :generator:`Visual Studio 8 2005` generators to generate the "remote
  directory" for WinCE project deployment and debugger settings.

* A :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_CLANG_TIDY` target property and supporting
  :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_CLANG_TIDY` variable were introduced to tell the
  :ref:`Makefile Generators` and the :generator:`Ninja` generator to run
  ``clang-tidy`` along with the compiler for ``C`` and ``CXX`` languages.

* A :prop_test:`TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH` test property was introduced to
  optionally tell CTest to enforce a secondary timeout after matching
  certain output from a test.

* A :prop_tgt:`VS_CONFIGURATION_TYPE` target property was introduced
  to specify a custom project file type for :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`
  supporting VS 2010 and above.

* A :prop_dir:`VS_STARTUP_PROJECT` directory property was introduced
  to specify for :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` the default startup
  project for generated solutions (``.sln`` files).

Modules
-------

* The :module:`CMakePushCheckState` module now pushes/pops/resets the variable
  ``CMAKE_EXTRA_INCLUDE_FILE`` used in :module:`CheckTypeSize`.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module leared the ``GIT_SHALLOW 1``
  option to perform a shallow clone of a Git repository.

  recursively and also to initialize new submodules on updates.  Use the
  ``GIT_SUBMODULES`` option to restrict which submodules are initialized and
  updated.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module leared the ``DOWNLOAD_NO_EXTRACT 1``
  argument to skip extracting the file that is downloaded (e.g., for
  self-extracting shell installers or ``.msi`` files).

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module now uses ``TLS_VERIFY`` when fetching
  from git repositories.

* The :module:`FindBLAS` and :module:`FindLAPACK` modules learned to
  support `OpenBLAS <http://www.openblas.net>`__.

* The :module:`FindCUDA` module learned to find the ``cublas_device`` library.

* The :module:`FindGTest` module ``gtest_add_tests`` function now causes
  CMake to automatically re-run when test sources change so that they
  can be re-scanned.

* The :module:`FindLTTngUST` module was introduced to find the LTTng-UST
  library.

* The :module:`FindPkgConfig` module learned to optionally create imported
  targets for the libraries it has found.

* The :module:`FindProtobuf` module learned to provide a ``Protobuf_VERSION``
  variable and check the version number requested in a :command:`find_package`
  call.

* The :module:`InstallRequiredSystemLibraries` module learned a new
  ``CMAKE_INSTALL_UCRT_LIBRARIES`` option to enable app-local deployment
  of the Windows Universal CRT libraries with Visual Studio 2015.

Platforms
---------

* The Clang compiler is now supported on CYGWIN.

* Support was added for the Bruce C Compiler with compiler id ``Bruce``.

CTest
-----

* The :command:`ctest_update` command now looks at the
  :variable:`CTEST_GIT_INIT_SUBMODULES` variable to determine whether
  submodules should be updated or not before updating.

* The :command:`ctest_update` command will now synchronize submodules on an
  update. Updates which add submodules or change a submodule's URL will now be
  pulled properly.

CPack
-----

* The :module:`CPackDeb` module learned how to handle ``$ORIGIN``
  in ``CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH`` when :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS`
  is used for dependency auto detection.

* The :module:`CPackDeb` module learned how to generate ``DEBIAN/shlibs``
  contorl file when package contains shared libraries.

* The :module:`CPackDeb` module learned how to generate ``DEBIAN/postinst`` and
  ``DEBIAN/postrm`` files if the package installs libraries in
  ldconfig-controlled locations (e.g. ``/lib/``, ``/usr/lib/``).

* The :module:`CPackDeb` module learned how to generate dependencies between
  Debian packages if multi-component setup is used and
  :variable:`CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_DEPENDS` variables are set.
  For backward compatibility this feature is disabled by default.
  See :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_ENABLE_COMPONENT_DEPENDS`.

* The :module:`CPackDeb` module learned how to set custom package file names
  including how to generate properly-named Debian packages::

    <PackageName>_<VersionNumber>-<DebianRevisionNumber>_<DebianArchitecture>.deb

  For backward compatibility this feature is disabled by default. See
  :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_FILE_NAME` and
  :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_FILE_NAME`.

* The :module:`CPackDeb` module learned how to set the package release number
  (``DebianRevisionNumber`` in package file name when used in combination with
  ``DEB-DEFAULT`` value set by :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_FILE_NAME`).  See
  :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_RELEASE`.

* The :module:`CPackDeb` module learned how to set the package architecture
  per-component.  See :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE`.

* The :module:`CPackDMG` module learned a new option to tell the CPack
  ``DragNDrop`` generaor to skip the ``/Applications`` symlink.
  See the :variable:`CPACK_DMG_DISABLE_APPLICATIONS_SYMLINK` variable.

* The :module:`CPackIFW` module gained a new
  :command:`cpack_ifw_update_repository` command to update a QtIFW-specific
  repository from a remote repository.

* The :module:`CPackRPM` module learned how to set RPM ``dist`` tag as part of
  RPM ``Release:`` tag when enabled (mandatory on some Linux distributions for
  e.g. on Fedora).
  See :variable:`CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELEASE_DIST`.

* The :module:`CPackRPM` module learned how to set default values for owning
  user/group and file/directory permissions of package content.
  See :variable:`CPACK_RPM_DEFAULT_USER`, :variable:`CPACK_RPM_DEFAULT_GROUP`,
  :variable:`CPACK_RPM_DEFAULT_FILE_PERMISSIONS`,
  :variable:`CPACK_RPM_DEFAULT_DIR_PERMISSIONS` and their per component
  counterparts.

* The :module:`CPackRPM` module learned how to set user defined package file
  names, how to specify that rpmbuild should decide on file name format as
  well as handling of multiple rpm packages generated by a single user defined
  spec file.
  See :variable:`CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_NAME` and
  :variable:`CPACK_RPM_<component>_PACKAGE_NAME`.

* The :module:`CPackRPM` module learned how to correctly handle symlinks
  that are pointing outside generated packages.

Other
-----

* The :manual:`Compile Features <cmake-compile-features(7)>` functionality
  is now aware of features supported by Intel C++ compilers versions 12.1
  through 16.0 on UNIX platforms.

Deprecated and Removed Features
===============================

* The :module:`CMakeForceCompiler` module and its macros are now deprecated.
  See module documentation for an explanation.

* The :command:`find_library`, :command:`find_path`, and :command:`find_file`
  commands no longer search in installation prefixes derived from the ``PATH``
  environment variable on non-Windows platforms.  This behavior was added in
  CMake 3.3 to support Windows hosts but has proven problematic on UNIX hosts.
  Users that keep some ``<prefix>/bin`` directories in the ``PATH`` just for
  their tools do not necessarily want any supporting ``<prefix>/lib``
  directories searched.  One may set the ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` environment
  variable with a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of prefixes that are
  to be searched.

* The :generator:`Visual Studio 7 .NET 2003` generator is now
  deprecated and will be removed in a future version of CMake.

* The :generator:`Visual Studio 7` generator (for VS .NET 2002) has been
  removed.  It had been deprecated since CMake 3.3.

* The :generator:`Visual Studio 6` generator has been removed.
  It had been deprecated since CMake 3.3.

Other Changes
=============

* The precompiled OS X binary provided on ``cmake.org`` now requires
  OS X 10.7 or newer.

* On Linux and FreeBSD platforms, when building CMake itself from source and
  not using a system-provided libcurl, OpenSSL is now used by default if it is
  found on the system.  This enables SSL/TLS support for commands supporting
  network communication via ``https``, such as :command:`file(DOWNLOAD)`,
  :command:`file(UPLOAD)`, and :command:`ctest_submit`.

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` ``--build`` command-line tool now rejects multiple
  ``--target`` options with an error instead of silently ignoring all but the
  last one.

* :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` now diagnoses name collisions when multiple source
  files in different directories use ``#include <moc_foo.cpp>`` with the
  same name (because the generated ``moc_foo.cpp`` files would collide).

* The :module:`FindBISON` module ``BISON_TARGET`` macro now supports
  special characters by passing the ``VERBATIM`` option to internal
  :command:`add_custom_command` calls.  This may break clients that
  added escaping manually to work around the bug.

* The :module:`FindFLEX` module ``FLEX_TARGET`` macro now supports
  special characters by passing the ``VERBATIM`` option to internal
  :command:`add_custom_command` calls.  This may break clients that
  added escaping manually to work around the bug.

* The :module:`FindProtobuf` module input and output variables were all renamed
  from ``PROTOBUF_`` to ``Protobuf_`` for consistency with other find modules.
  Input variables of the old case will be honored if provided, and output
  variables of the old case are always provided.

* The :module:`CPackRPM` module now supports upper cased component
  names in per component CPackRPM specific variables.
  E.g. component named ``foo`` now expects component specific
  variable to be ``CPACK_RPM_FOO_PACKAGE_NAME`` while before
  it expected ``CPACK_RPM_foo_PACKAGE_NAME``.
  Upper cased component name part in variables is compatible
  with convention used for other CPack variables.
  For back compatibility old format of variables is still valid
  and preferred if both versions of variable are set, but the
  preferred future use is upper cased component names in variables.
  New variables that will be added to CPackRPM in later versions
  will only support upper cased component variable format.

* The CPack NSIS generator's configuration file template was fixed to
  quote the path to the uninstaller tool used by the
  :variable:`CPACK_NSIS_ENABLE_UNINSTALL_BEFORE_INSTALL` option.
  This avoids depending on an insecure Windows feature to run an
  uninstaller tool with a space in the path.
CMake 3.3 Release Notes
***********************

.. only:: html

  .. contents::

Changes made since CMake 3.2 include the following.

New Features
============

Generators
----------

* The :ref:`Makefile Generators` now add ``.DELETE_ON_ERROR`` to the
  makefiles that contain the actual build rules for files on disk.
  This tells GNU make to remove rule outputs when their recipe
  modifies an output but fails.

* The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` learned to support ``.xaml``
  source files and automatically associate them with corresponding
  ``.h`` and ``.cpp`` sources.

* A new experimental :generator:`Green Hills MULTI` generator was
  added on Windows.  `Green Hills MULTI`_ is an IDE for embedded
  real-time systems.

.. _`Green Hills MULTI`: http://www.ghs.com/products/MULTI_IDE.html

Commands
--------

* The :command:`add_dependencies` command learned to allow dependencies
  to be added to :ref:`interface libraries <Interface Libraries>`.
  Dependencies added to an interface library are followed transitively
  in its place since the target itself does not build.

* The :command:`execute_process` command learned to support specifying
  the same file for ``OUTPUT_FILE`` and ``ERROR_FILE``.

* The :command:`file(GLOB)` and :command:`file(GLOB_RECURSE)` commands
  learned a new ``LIST_DIRECTORIES <bool>`` option to specify whether
  the glob result should include directories.

* The :command:`find_library`, :command:`find_path`, and :command:`find_file`
  commands now search in installation prefixes derived from the ``PATH``
  environment variable.

* The :command:`if` command learned a new ``IN_LIST`` operator that
  evaluates to true if a given element is contained in a named list.

* The :command:`install(EXPORT)` and :command:`export()` commands
  learned to export targets that populate the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_SOURCES`
  target property.

* The :command:`install(TARGETS)` command learned to support
  generator expressions in the ``DESTINATION`` value.

Variables
---------

* The version of some Fortran compilers is now detected and stored in the
  :variable:`CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER_VERSION <CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION>`
  variable.

* The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` learned a new
  :variable:`CMAKE_VS_INCLUDE_INSTALL_TO_DEFAULT_BUILD` option
  to put the ``INSTALL`` target in the default build of a
  solution (``.sln``) file.

Properties
----------

* A :prop_tgt:`CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR` target property and supporting
  :variable:`CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR` variable were introduced
  to allow target platform binaries to run on the host during cross
  compiling.

* A :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE` target property and supporting
  :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE` variable were introduced
  to tell the :ref:`Makefile Generators` and the :generator:`Ninja` generator
  to run ``include-what-you-use`` along with the compiler for ``C`` and
  ``CXX`` languages.

* The :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET` and
  :prop_tgt:`VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN` target properties now
  affect compilation in sources of all target types.  See
  policy :policy:`CMP0063`.

* The :prop_tgt:`XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an-attribute>` target property learned
  to support generator expressions.

Modules
-------

* The :module:`CheckFortranCompilerFlag` module was introduced
  to check ``Fortran`` compiler flags, much like the
  :module:`CheckCCompilerFlag` module already does for ``C``.

* The :module:`ExternalData` module learned a new
  :variable:`ExternalData_NO_SYMLINKS` option to disable use of
  symbolic links to populate the real data files and use copies
  instead.

* The :module:`ExternalData` module learned a new ``RECURSE:``
  option in ``DATA{}`` references specifying directories.
  This allows an entire directory tree of associated files
  to be matched.

* The :module:`ExternalData` module learned a new URL template
  placeholder ``%(algo:<key>)`` to allow custom mapping from
  algorithm name to URL component through configuration of new
  :variable:`ExternalData_URL_ALGO_<algo>_<key>` variables.
  This allows more flexibility in remote URLs.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module learned to replace tokens
  like ``<BINARY_DIR>`` in the ``BYPRODUCTS`` of each step.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module APIs learned to support
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
  when using ``LOG_*`` options and in CMake initial cache options.

* The :module:`FindBoost` module now tracks the directories containing
  libraries separately for RELEASE and DEBUG configurations.

* The :module:`FindCUDA` module now defaults to using the static
  CUDA runtime library if it is available.  A new
  ``CUDA_USE_STATIC_CUDA_RUNTIME`` option is offered to control
  this behavior.

* The :module:`FindMatlab` module was completely rewritten.  It learned
  about versions and components and to find Matlab in a more precise and
  multiplatform way.  The module now offers APIs to create mex extensions,
  documentation, and unit tests.

* The :module:`FindPackageHandleStandardArgs` module
  ``FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS`` function now
  always populates both the ``<PackageName>_FOUND``
  and ``<UPPERCASE_NAME>_FOUND`` variables (the latter
  for backwards compatibility).  The ``FOUND_VAR``
  option is now ignored except to enforce its allowed
  values.

* The :module:`InstallRequiredSystemLibraries` module learned a new
  ``CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_COMPONENT`` option to specify the
  installation component.

Generator Expressions
---------------------

* A new ``COMPILE_LANGUAGE`` generator expression was introduced to
  allow specification of compile options for target files based on the
  :prop_sf:`LANGUAGE` of each source file.  Due to limitations of the
  underlying native build tools, this feature has varying support across
  generators.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual
  for details.

CTest
-----

* The :manual:`ctest(1)` tool learned a new ``--repeat-until-fail <n>``
  option to help find sporadic test failures.

* The :module:`CTestCoverageCollectGCOV` module learned to support
  the same ``CTEST_CUSTOM_COVERAGE_EXCLUDE`` option as the
  :command:`ctest_coverage` command.

CPack
-----

* The :manual:`cpack(1)` ``IFW`` generator and the :module:`CPackIFW`
  module learned to support Qt Framework Installer 2.0 tools.

* The :module:`CPackDeb` module learned a new
  :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS`
  variable to specify per-component use of ``dpkg-shlibdeps``.

* The :module:`CPackDeb` module learned a new
  :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_DEPENDS`
  option to specify per-component dependencies.

* The :module:`CPackRPM` module learned to package symbolic links
  more cleanly and now supports directory symlinks with recent
  ``rpmbuild`` versions.

* The :module:`CPackRPM` module learned a new
  :variable:`CPACK_RPM_ADDITIONAL_MAN_DIRS` variable to specify
  directories containing man pages for the brp-compress RPM macro.

* The :module:`CPackRPM` module learned a new
  :variable:`CPACK_RPM_<component>_PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE` variable
  to specify a component-specific package architecture.

* The CPack WIX generator learned the new
  :prop_inst:`CPACK_START_MENU_SHORTCUTS`,
  :prop_inst:`CPACK_DESKTOP_SHORTCUTS` and
  :prop_inst:`CPACK_STARTUP_SHORTCUTS` installed file properties which can
  be used to install shorcuts in the Start Menu, on the Desktop and
  in the Startup Folder respectively.

Other
-----

* The :manual:`Compile Features <cmake-compile-features(7)>` functionality
  is now aware of features supported by GNU compilers on Windows, versions
  4.4 through 5.0.

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-E tar`` command learned a new
  ``--format<format>`` option to specify the archive format to
  be written.

* On OS X, CMake learned to create XCTest bundles to test Frameworks
  and App Bundles within Xcode.  The :module:`FindXCTest` module
  provides convenience functions to handle :prop_tgt:`XCTEST` bundles.

Deprecated and Removed Features
===============================

* On OS X the :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` no longer has the
  ``Install For Command Line Use`` menu item.  Instead there
  is a ``How to Install For Command Line Use`` menu item
  that shows an informational dialog box explaining how to
  make the command line tools available.  For example::

    /Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui --install

* The :command:`ctest_build` and :command:`build_command` commands
  no longer tell ``make`` tools to ignore errors with the ``-i`` option.
  Previously this was done for :ref:`Makefile Generators` but not others.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0061`.

* The :generator:`Visual Studio 10 2010` generator no longer checks
  for running VS IDEs with the project open or asks them to reload.
  This was originally done for VS 10 because it had been done for
  VS 7 through 9 to avoid prompting for every project in a solution.
  Since VS >= 10 allow the whole solution to reload at once they
  do not need CMake to help them.

* The :generator:`Visual Studio 7` generator (.NET 2002) is now
  deprecated and will be removed in a future version of CMake.

* The :generator:`Visual Studio 6` generator is now deprecated
  and will be removed in a future version of CMake.

* The :command:`find_package` command no longer considers project
  build trees recently configured in a :manual:`cmake-gui(1)`.
  This was previously done only on Windows and is now never done.
  The ``NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH`` option is now ignored if given
  and effectively always on.
  Projects may populate the :ref:`User Package Registry` to aid
  users building multiple dependent projects one after another.

* The :command:`add_definitions()` command no longer causes a
  :prop_dir:`DEFINITIONS` directory property to be populated. See policy
  :policy:`CMP0059`.

* With Visual Studio 7, 8, and 9 generators the value of the ``$(OutDir)``
  placeholder no longer evaluates to the configuration name.  Projects
  should use ``$(ConfigurationName)`` for that instead.

* Using the output of :command:`export()` with the :command:`install(FILES)`
  command is no longer allowed.  See policy :policy:`CMP0062` for details.

Other Changes
=============

* The :generator:`Ninja` generator now requires that calls to the
  :command:`add_custom_command` and :command:`add_custom_target`
  commands use the ``BYPRODUCTS`` option to explicitly specify any
  files generated by the custom commands that are not listed as
  outputs (perhaps because their timestamps are allowed to be older
  than the inputs).  See policy :policy:`CMP0058`.

* Build-time progress output of :ref:`Makefile Generators` has been improved.
  It no longer mixes progress and build rule messages during parallel builds.
  The link rule messages now have progress and are displayed as bold green
  instead of bold red (since red is often associated with an error message).

* The :variable:`CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR` variable value for Visual Studio
  7, 8, and 9 is now ``$(ConfigurationName)`` instead of ``$(OutDir)``.
  This should have no effect on the intended use cases of the variable.

* Linking to library files by a full path in an implicit linker search
  directory (e.g. ``/usr/lib/libfoo.a``) no longer asks the linker to
  search for the library (e.g. ``-lfoo``) and now links by full path.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0060`.
CMake 3.5 Release Notes
***********************

.. only:: html

  .. contents::

Changes made since CMake 3.4 include the following.

New Features
============

GUI
---

* The :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` gained options to control warnings about
  deprecated functionality.

* The :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` learned an option to set the toolset
  to be used with VS IDE and Xcode generators, much like the
  existing ``-T`` option to :manual:`cmake(1)`.

* The :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` gained a Regular Expression Explorer which
  may be used to create and evaluate regular expressions in real-time.
  The explorer window is available via the ``Tools`` menu.

Command-Line
------------

* The ``-Wdev`` and ``-Wno-dev`` :manual:`cmake(1)` options now also enable
  and suppress the deprecated warnings output by default.

* The suppression of developer warnings as errors can now be controlled with
  the new ``-Werror=dev`` and ``-Wno-error=dev`` :manual:`cmake(1)` options.

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-E`` command-line tools ``copy``,
  ``copy_if_different``, ``copy_directory``, and ``make_directory``
  learned to support multiple input files or directories.

Commands
--------

* The :command:`cmake_parse_arguments` command is now implemented natively.
  The :module:`CMakeParseArguments` module remains as an empty placeholder
  for compatibility.

* The :command:`install(DIRECTORY)` command learned to support
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
  in the list of directories.

Variables
---------

* The :variable:`CMAKE_ERROR_DEPRECATED` variable can now be set using the
  ``-Werror=deprecated`` and ``-Wno-error=deprecated`` :manual:`cmake(1)`
  options.

  ``-Wdeprecated`` and ``-Wno-deprecated`` :manual:`cmake(1)` options.

Properties
----------

* The :prop_tgt:`VS_GLOBAL_<variable>` target property is now implemented
  for VS 2010 and above.  Previously it worked only in VS 2008 and below.

Modules
-------

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module learned a new ``GIT_REMOTE_NAME``
  option to control the ``git clone --origin`` value.

* The :module:`FindBoost` module now provides imported targets
  such as ``Boost::boost`` and ``Boost::filesystem``.

* The :module:`FindFLEX` module ``FLEX_TARGET`` macro learned a
  new ``DEFINES_FILE`` option to specify a custom output header
  to be generated.

* The :module:`FindGTest` module now provides imported targets.

* The :module:`FindGTK2` module, when ``GTK2_USE_IMPORTED_TARGETS`` is
  enabled, now sets ``GTK2_LIBRARIES`` to contain the list of imported
  targets instead of the paths to the libraries.  Moreover it now sets
  a new ``GTK2_TARGETS`` variable containing all the targets imported.

* The :module:`FindOpenMP` module learned to support Clang.

* The :module:`FindOpenSSL` module gained a new
  ``OPENSSL_MSVC_STATIC_RT`` option to search for libraries using
  the MSVC static runtime.

* The :module:`FindPNG` module now provides imported targets.

* The :module:`FindTIFF` module now provides imported targets.

* A :module:`FindXalanC` module was introduced to find the
  Apache Xalan-C++ XSL transform processing library.

* The :module:`FindXercesC` module now provides imported targets.

Platforms
---------

* Support was added for the ARM Compiler (arm.com) with compiler id ``ARMCC``.

* A new platform file for cross-compiling in the Cray Linux Environment to
  target compute nodes was added.  See
  :ref:`Cross Compiling for the Cray Linux Environment <Cray Cross-Compile>`
  for usage details.

* The :manual:`Compile Features <cmake-compile-features(7)>` functionality
  is now aware of features supported by Clang compilers on Windows (MinGW).

* When building for embedded Apple platforms like iOS CMake learned to build and
  install combined targets which contain both a device and a simulator build.
  This behavior can be enabled by setting the :prop_tgt:`IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED`
  target property.

CPack
-----

* The :module:`CPackDMG` module learned new variable to specify AppleScript
  file run to customize appearance of ``DragNDrop`` installer folder,
  including background image setting using supplied PNG or multi-resolution
  TIFF file.  See the :variable:`CPACK_DMG_DS_STORE_SETUP_SCRIPT` and
  :variable:`CPACK_DMG_BACKGROUND_IMAGE` variables.

* The :module:`CPackDeb` module learned to set the optional config
  file ``Source`` field using a monolithic or per-component variable.
  See :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SOURCE`.

* The :module:`CPackDeb` module learned to set Package, Section
  and Priority control fields per-component.
  See variables :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_SECTION` and
  :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_PRIORITY`.

* The :module:`CPack DragNDrop generator <CPackDMG>` learned to add
  multi-lingual SLAs to a DMG which is presented to the user when they try to
  mount the DMG.  See the :variable:`CPACK_DMG_SLA_LANGUAGES` and
  :variable:`CPACK_DMG_SLA_DIR` variables for details.

* The :module:`CPackNSIS` module learned new variables to add bitmaps to the
  installer.  See the :variable:`CPACK_NSIS_MUI_WELCOMEFINISHPAGE_BITMAP`
  and :variable:`CPACK_NSIS_MUI_UNWELCOMEFINISHPAGE_BITMAP` variables.

* The :module:`CPackRPM` module learned to set Name and Group
  control fields per-component.
  See :variable:`CPACK_RPM_<component>_PACKAGE_NAME`
  and :variable:`CPACK_RPM_<component>_PACKAGE_GROUP`.

Other
-----

* Warnings about deprecated functionality are now enabled by default.
  They may be suppressed with ``-Wno-deprecated`` or by setting the
  :variable:`CMAKE_WARN_DEPRECATED` variable to false.

Deprecated and Removed Features
===============================

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-E time`` command now properly passes arguments
  with spaces or special characters through to the child process.  This
  may break scripts that worked around the bug with their own extra
  quoting or escaping.

* The :generator:`Xcode` generator was fixed to escape backslashes in
  strings consistently with other generators.  Projects that previously
  worked around the inconsistecy with an extra level of backslashes
  conditioned on the Xcode generator must be updated to remove the
  workaround for CMake 3.5 and greater.

Other Changes
=============

* The :generator:`Visual Studio 14 2015` generator learned to map the
  ``/debug:fastlink`` linker flag to the ``.vcxproj`` file property.

* The :module:`FindGTK2` module now configures the ``GTK2::sigc++`` imported
  target to enable c++11 on its dependents when using sigc++ 2.5.1 or higher.

* The precompiled Windows binary provided on ``cmake.org`` is now a
  ``.msi`` package instead of an installer executable.  One may need
  to manually uninstall CMake versions lower than 3.5 before installing
  the new package.
CMake 3.8 Release Notes
***********************

.. only:: html

  .. contents::

Changes made since CMake 3.7 include the following.

New Features
============

Languages
---------

C#
^^

* CMake learned to support ``CSharp`` (C#) as a first-class language that
  can be enabled via the :command:`project` and :command:`enable_language`
  commands.  It is currently supported by the :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`
  for VS 2010 and above.

  C# assemblies and programs can be added just like common C++ targets using
  the :command:`add_library` and :command:`add_executable` commands.
  References between C# targets in the same source tree may be specified by
  :command:`target_link_libraries` like for C++.  References to system or
  3rd-party assemblies may be specified by the target properties
  :prop_tgt:`VS_DOTNET_REFERENCE_<refname>` and
  :prop_tgt:`VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES`.

* More fine tuning of C# targets may be done using target and source
  file properties.  Specifically the target properties related to
  Visual Studio (``VS_*``) are worth a look (for setting toolset
  versions, root namespaces, assembly icons, ...).

CUDA
^^^^

* CMake learned to support ``CUDA`` as a first-class language that can be
  enabled via the :command:`project` and :command:`enable_language` commands.

* ``CUDA`` is currently supported by the :ref:`Makefile Generators`
  and the :generator:`Ninja` generator on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
  Support for the Visual Studio IDE is under development but not
  included in this release.

* The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit compiler (``nvcc``) is supported.

C & C++
^^^^^^^

* The :manual:`Compile Features <cmake-compile-features(7)>` functionality
  now offers meta-features that request compiler modes for specific language
  standard levels (e.g. ``cxx_std_11``).  See
  :prop_gbl:`CMAKE_C_KNOWN_FEATURES` and :prop_gbl:`CMAKE_CXX_KNOWN_FEATURES`.

* The :manual:`Compile Features <cmake-compile-features(7)>` functionality
  is now aware of C++ 17.  No specific features are yet enumerated besides
  the ``cxx_std_17`` meta-feature.

* The :manual:`Compile Features <cmake-compile-features(7)>` functionality
  is now aware of the availability of C99 in gcc since version 3.4.

Platforms
---------

* A new minimal platform file for ``Fuchsia`` was added.

Generators
----------

* The :generator:`CodeBlocks` extra generator may now be used to
  generate with :generator:`NMake Makefiles JOM`.

* The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2013 and above learned to
  support a ``host=x64`` option in the :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`
  value (e.g.  via the :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-T`` option) to request use
  of a VS 64-bit toolchain on 64-bit hosts.

* The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` learned to treat files passed to
  :command:`target_link_libraries` whose names end in ``.targets``
  as MSBuild "targets" files to be imported into generated project files.

Commands
--------

* The :command:`add_custom_command` and :command:`add_custom_target` commands
  learned the option ``COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS`` which causes lists in the
  ``COMMAND`` argument to be expanded, including lists created by generator
  expressions.

* The :command:`execute_process` command gained an ``ENCODING`` option to
  specify on Windows which encoding is used for output from child process.

* The :command:`math(EXPR)` command gained support for unary
  ``+`` and ``-`` operators.

* The :command:`source_group` command gained ``TREE`` and ``PREFIX``
  options to add groups following source tree directory structure.

* The :command:`string(TIMESTAMP)` command learned to treat ``%%``
  as a way to encode plain ``%``.

* The :command:`string(TIMESTAMP)` command will now honor the
  ``SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`` environment variable and use its value
  instead of the current time.

* The :command:`try_compile` command source file signature gained new options
  to specify the language standard to use in the generated test project.

* The :command:`try_compile` command source file signature now honors
  language standard variables like :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD`.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0067`.

Variables
---------

* A :variable:`CMAKE_CODELITE_USE_TARGETS` variable was added to tell the
  :generator:`CodeLite` extra generator to change the generated project
  to have target-centric organization.
  The ``build``, ``rebuild``, and ``clean`` operations within ``CodeLite``
  then work on a selected target rather than the whole workspace.
  (Note that the :generator:`Ninja` clean operation on a target
  includes its dependencies, though.)

* The :variable:`CMAKE_SUBLIME_TEXT_2_ENV_SETTINGS` variable was added to
  tell the :generator:`Sublime Text 2` extra generator to place specified
  environment variables in the generated ``.sublime-project``.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_SUBLIME_TEXT_2_EXCLUDE_BUILD_TREE` variable was added
  to tell the :generator:`Sublime Text 2` extra generator whether to exclude
  the build tree from the ``.sublime-project`` when it is inside the source
  tree.

* A :variable:`CMAKE_VS_INCLUDE_PACKAGE_TO_DEFAULT_BUILD` variable was
  added to tell :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above
  to include the ``PACKAGE`` target in the default build, similar to
  the existing :variable:`CMAKE_VS_INCLUDE_INSTALL_TO_DEFAULT_BUILD`
  variable for the ``INSTALL`` target.

Properties
----------

* A :prop_tgt:`BUILD_RPATH` target property and corresponding
  :variable:`CMAKE_BUILD_RPATH` variable were added to support custom
  ``RPATH`` locations to be added to binaries in the build tree.

* The :prop_sf:`COMPILE_FLAGS` source file property learned to support
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.

* The :prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK` target property may now also be applied to
  static libraries on Apple targets.  It will result in a proper
  Framework but with a static library inside.

* :ref:`Imported <Imported Targets>` :ref:`Interface Libraries` learned new
  :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LIBNAME` and :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LIBNAME_<CONFIG>`
  target properties to specify a link library name since interface libraries
  do not build their own library files.

* A :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_CPPLINT` target property and supporting
  :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_CPPLINT` variable were introduced to tell
  the :ref:`Makefile Generators` and the :generator:`Ninja` generator to
  run the ``cpplint`` style checker along with the compiler for ``C`` and
  ``CXX`` languages.

* A :prop_tgt:`MANUALLY_ADDED_DEPENDENCIES` target property has been added.
  It provides a read-only list of dependencies that have been added with
  the :command:`add_dependencies` command.

* The :prop_tgt:`MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>` target property learned
  to interpret empty list elements as referring to the configuration-less
  imported location specified by :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION`.

* The :prop_tgt:`NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED` target property is now supported
  on :ref:`Imported <Imported Targets>` :ref:`Interface Libraries`.

* New source file properties :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOMOC`, :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOUIC`,
  :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTORCC`, and :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOGEN` were added to allow
  source files to be excluded from processing by :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC`,
  :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`, and :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC` target properties.

* A :prop_sf:`VS_COPY_TO_OUT_DIR` source file property was added to
  tell :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above whether
  or not a file should e copied to the output directory.

* A :prop_tgt:`VS_DEBUGGER_WORKING_DIRECTORY` target property was added
  to tell :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above what
  debugger working directory should be set for the target.

* A :prop_tgt:`VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES_COPY_LOCAL` target property was added
  to specify whether to copy referenced assemblies to the output directory.

* A :prop_tgt:`VS_DOTNET_REFERENCE_<refname>` target property was added
  to tell :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above to add
  a .NET reference with a given hint path.

* A :prop_sf:`VS_INCLUDE_IN_VSIX` source file property was added to
  tell :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above whether
  to include the file in a Visual Studio extension package.

* A :prop_sf:`VS_RESOURCE_GENERATOR` source file property was added to
  give :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above a setting
  for the resource generator (``C#`` only).

* A :prop_tgt:`VS_USER_PROPS` target property was added to tell
  :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above to use a
  custom MSBuild user ``.props`` file.

* A :prop_gbl:`XCODE_EMIT_EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME` global property was
  added to tell the :generator:`Xcode` generator whether to emit the
  ``EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME`` variable.  This is useful when building
  with multiple SDKs like ``macosx`` and ``iphoneos`` in parallel.

* New :prop_tgt:`XCODE_PRODUCT_TYPE` and :prop_tgt:`XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE`
  target properties were created to tell the :generator:`Xcode` generator
  to use custom values of the corresponding attributes for a target in the
  generated Xcode project.

Modules
-------

* A :module:`CSharpUtilities` module was added to aid parameterization of
  Visual Studio C# targets.  It provides functions to allow automated
  setting of source file properties to support Windows Forms, WPF/XAML or
  other technologies as needed.

* The :module:`ExternalData` module learned to support multiple
  content links for one data file using different hashes, e.g.
  ``img.png.sha256`` and ``img.png.sha1``.  This allows objects
  to be fetched from sources indexed by different hash algorithms.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module gained the ``GIT_PROGRESS`` option to
  force Git to show progress when cloning repositories.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module gained a ``GIT_CONFIG`` option
  to pass ``--config`` options to Git when cloning repositories.

* The :module:`FeatureSummary` module :command:`feature_summary` command now
  accepts a new ``QUIET_ON_EMPTY`` option that suppresses the output when
  the list of packages that belong to the selected category is empty.

* The :module:`FeatureSummary` module :command:`add_feature_info` command
  now accepts lists of dependencies for deciding whether a feature is enabled
  or not.

* The package types accepted by the :module:`FeatureSummary` module can now
  be tweaked by changing the :variable:`FeatureSummary_PKG_TYPES`,
  :variable:`FeatureSummary_REQUIRED_PKG_TYPES` and
  :variable:`FeatureSummary_DEFAULT_PKG_TYPE` global properties.

* The :module:`FindOpenGL` module now provides imported targets
  ``OpenGL::GL`` and ``OpenGL::GLU`` when the libraries are found.

* The :module:`UseSWIG` module gained a ``swig_add_library`` command
  to give more flexibility over the old ``swig_add_module`` command.

* The :module:`UseSWIG` module ``swig_add_source_to_module`` command
  learned a new ``SWIG_OUTFILE_DIR`` option to control the output
  file location (``swig -o``).

* The :module:`WriteCompilerDetectionHeader` module gained the
  ``ALLOW_UNKNOWN_COMPILERS`` and ``ALLOW_UNKNOWN_COMPILER_VERSIONS`` options
  that allow creation of headers that will work also with unknown or old
  compilers by simply assuming they do not support any of the requested
  features.

CTest
-----

* The :command:`ctest_memcheck` command gained a ``DEFECT_COUNT <var>``
  option to capture the number of memory defects detected.

* The :command:`ctest_memcheck` command learned to read the location of
  suppressions files for sanitizers from the
  :variable:`CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_SUPPRESSIONS_FILE` variable.

* The :command:`ctest_memcheck` command learned to support ``LeakSanitizer``
  independently from ``AddressSanitizer``.

* The :command:`ctest_update` command ``CDASH_UPLOAD`` signature was taught
  to honor the ``RETRY_COUNT``, ``RETRY_DELAY``, and ``QUIET`` options.

CPack
-----

* The :module:`CPackIFWConfigureFile` module was added to define a new
  :command:`cpack_ifw_configure_file` command to configure file templates
  prepared in QtIFW/SDK/Creator style.

* The :module:`CPackIFW` module :command:`cpack_ifw_configure_component` and
  :command:`cpack_ifw_configure_component_group` commands gained a new
  ``DEFAULT``, ``VIRTUAL``, ``FORCED_INSTALLATION``, ``REQUIRES_ADMIN_RIGHTS``,
  ``DISPLAY_NAME``, ``UPDATE_TEXT``, ``DESCRIPTION``, ``RELEASE_DATE``,
  ``AUTO_DEPEND_ON`` and ``TRANSLATIONS`` options to more specific
  configuration.

* The :module:`CPackIFW` module :command:`cpack_ifw_configure_component`
  command gained a new ``DEPENDENCIES`` alias for ``DEPENDS`` option.

* The :module:`CPackIFW` module :command:`cpack_ifw_configure_component_group`
  command gained a new ``DEPENDS`` option. The ``DEPENDENCIES`` alias also
  added.

* The :module:`CPackIFW` module :command:`cpack_ifw_configure_component` and
  :command:`cpack_ifw_configure_component_group` commands ``PRIORITY``
  option now is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of CMake.
  Please use new ``SORTING_PRIORITY`` option instead.

* The :module:`CPackIFW` module gained new
  :variable:`CPACK_IFW_PACKAGE_WATERMARK`,
  :variable:`CPACK_IFW_PACKAGE_BANNER`,
  :variable:`CPACK_IFW_PACKAGE_BACKGROUND`,
  :variable:`CPACK_IFW_PACKAGE_WIZARD_STYLE`,
  :variable:`CPACK_IFW_PACKAGE_WIZARD_DEFAULT_WIDTH`,
  :variable:`CPACK_IFW_PACKAGE_WIZARD_DEFAULT_HEIGHT`, and
  :variable:`CPACK_IFW_PACKAGE_TITLE_COLOR`
  variables to customize a QtIFW installer look.

* The :module:`CPackProductBuild` module gained options to sign packages.
  See the variables :variable:`CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_IDENTITY_NAME`,
  :variable:`CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_KEYCHAIN_PATH`,
  :variable:`CPACK_PKGBUILD_IDENTITY_NAME`, and
  :variable:`CPACK_PKGBUILD_KEYCHAIN_PATH`.

* The :module:`CPackRPM` module learned to omit tags that are not supported by
  provided ``rpmbuild`` tool. If unsupported tags are set they are ignored
  and a developer warning is printed out.

* The :module:`CPackRPM` module learned to generate main component package
  which forces generation of a rpm for defined component without component
  suffix in filename and package name.
  See :variable:`CPACK_RPM_MAIN_COMPONENT` variable.

* The :module:`CPackRPM` module learned to generate a single ``debuginfo``
  package on demand even if components packaging is used.
  See :variable:`CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_SINGLE_PACKAGE` variable.

* The :module:`CPackRPM` module learned to support
  multiple directives per file when using
  :variable:`CPACK_RPM_USER_FILELIST` variable.

Other
-----

* CMake functionality using cryptographic hashes now supports SHA-3 algorithms.

* A new generator expression ``$<IF:cond,true-value,false-value>`` was added.
  It resolves to the true-value if the condition is ``1`` and resolves to
  the false-value if the condition is ``0``.

Deprecated and Removed Features
===============================

* The :module:`FeatureSummary` module commands :command:`set_package_info`,
  :command:`set_feature_info`, :command:`print_enabled_features`, and
  :command:`print_disabled_features` are now deprecated.

* The :module:`UseSWIG` module ``swig_add_module`` command is now
  deprecated in favor of ``swig_add_library``.

Other Changes
=============

* If a command specified by the :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_CLANG_TIDY` target property
  returns non-zero at build time this is now treated as an error instead of
  silently ignored.

* The :command:`ctest_memcheck` command no longer automatically adds
  ``leak_check=1`` to the options used by ``AddressSanitizer``. The default
  behavior of ``AddressSanitizer`` is to run `LeakSanitizer` to check leaks
  unless ``leak_check=0``.

* The :command:`ctest_memcheck` command was fixed to correctly append extra
  sanitizer options read from the
  :variable:`CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_SANITIZER_OPTIONS` variable to the environment
  variables used internally by the sanitizers.

* The :module:`FeatureSummary` module :command:`set_package_properties`
  command no longer forces the package type to ``OPTIONAL`` when the type
  is not explicitly set.

* The :manual:`Compile Features <cmake-compile-features(7)>` functionality
  is now aware of features supported by Intel C++ compilers versions 12.1
  through 17.0 on UNIX and Windows platforms.

* Calls to the :module:`FindPkgConfig` module :command:`pkg_check_modules`
  command following a successful call learned to re-evaluate the cached values
  for a given prefix after changes to the parameters to the command for that
  prefix.

* When using :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` or :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`, generated
  ``moc_*``, ``*.moc`` and ``ui_*`` are placed in the
  ``<CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR>/<TARGETNAME>_autogen/include`` directory which
  is automatically added to the target's :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`.
  It is therefore not necessary anymore to have
  :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` in the target's
  :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`.

* The :generator:`Sublime Text 2` generator no longer runs the native
  build command (e.g. ``ninja`` or ``make``) with verbose build output
  enabled.

* The :command:`try_compile` command source file signature now
  honors the :variable:`CMAKE_WARN_DEPRECATED` variable value
  in the generated test project.

* The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above now place
  per-source file flags after target-wide flags when they are classified
  as raw flags with no project file setting (``AdditionalOptions``).
  This behavior is more consistent with the ordering of flags produced
  by other generators, and allows flags on more-specific properties
  (per-source) to override those on more general ones (per-target).

* The precompiled Windows binary MSI package provided on ``cmake.org`` now
  records the installation directory in the Windows Registry under the key
  ``HKLM\Software\Kitware\CMake`` with a value named ``InstallDir``.
CMake 3.9 Release Notes
***********************

.. only:: html

  .. contents::

Changes made since CMake 3.8 include the following.

New Features
============

Languages
---------

* ``CUDA`` is now supported by the :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`
  for VS 2010 and above.  This complements the existing support by the
  :ref:`Makefile Generators` and the :generator:`Ninja` generator.
  CUDA 8.0.61 or higher is recommended due to known bugs in the VS
  integration by earlier versions.

* CMake is now aware of the :prop_tgt:`C++ standards <CXX_STANDARD>` and
  :prop_tgt:`C standards <C_STANDARD>` and their associated meta-features for
  the following :variable:`compiler ids <CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID>`: ``Cray``,
  ``PGI``, and ``XL``.

Generators
----------

* :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above learned to support
  the ``ASM_NASM`` language when ``nasm`` is installed.

* The :generator:`Xcode` generator learned to create Xcode schema files.
  This is an experimental feature and can be activated by setting the
  :variable:`CMAKE_XCODE_GENERATE_SCHEME` variable to a ``TRUE`` value.

Commands
--------

* The :command:`add_library` command ``IMPORTED`` option learned to support
  :ref:`Object Libraries`.

* The :command:`find_library` command learned to search ``libx32`` paths
  when the build targets the ``x32`` ABI.  See the
  :prop_gbl:`FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS` global property.

* The :command:`include_external_msproject` command learned to use
  the :prop_tgt:`MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>` target property
  to map current configurations to the external configurations.

* The :command:`install(TARGETS)` command learned a new ``OBJECTS`` option to
  specify where to install :ref:`Object Libraries`.

* The :command:`install(EXPORT)` command learned how to export
  :ref:`Object Libraries`.

* The :command:`project` command learned an optional ``DESCRIPTION``
  parameter to set the :variable:`PROJECT_DESCRIPTION` variable.

* The :command:`separate_arguments` command gained a ``NATIVE_COMMAND`` mode
  that performs argument separation depending on the host operating system.

Variables
---------

* A :variable:`CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK_DEPRECATED_HEADERS` variable was added
  for use when :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android with the NDK` to request
  use of the deprecated headers even when unified headers are available.
  The default is now to use unified headers if available.

* A :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS` variable was introduced to
  allow :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOMOC` to extract additional dependency file names
  for ``moc`` from the contents of source files.

* A :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS` variable was introduced to
  allow :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOUIC` to search for ``foo.ui`` in more
  places than the vicinity of the file including ``ui_foo.h``.

* A :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX` variable was added to
  tell the :command:`find_library` command to search in a ``lib<suffix>``
  directory before each ``lib`` directory that would normally be searched.

* A :variable:`CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION` variable was added to
  initialize the :prop_tgt:`INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION` property on all
  targets.

* A :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_AR` variable was added to hold
  the path to the GCC/Clang wrapper of ``ar``.

* A :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_RANLIB` variable was added to hold
  the path to the GCC/Clang wrapper of ``ranlib``.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_SYSROOT_COMPILE` and :variable:`CMAKE_SYSROOT_LINK`
  variables were added to use separate sysroots for compiling and linking.

Properties
----------

* A new :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR` target property was introduced to set
  a custom output directory for :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC`, :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`,
  and :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC`.

* A new :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS` target property was introduced to
  allow :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` to extract additional dependency file names
  for ``moc`` from the contents of source files.

* A new :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS` target property was introduced to
  allow :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` to search for ``foo.ui`` in more
  places than the vicinity of the file including ``ui_foo.h``.

* Global properties :prop_gbl:`AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP`,
  :prop_gbl:`AUTOMOC_SOURCE_GROUP` and
  :prop_gbl:`AUTORCC_SOURCE_GROUP` were
  introduced to allow files generated by :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` or
  :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC` to be placed in a :command:`source_group`.

* A :prop_tgt:`BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR` target property and corresponding
  :variable:`CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR` variable were added to
  control whether to use the :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_NAME_DIR` target property
  value for binaries in the build tree.  This is for macOS ``install_name``
  as :prop_tgt:`BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH` is for ``RPATH``.

* A :prop_tgt:`CUDA_PTX_COMPILATION` target property was added to
  :ref:`Object Libraries` to support compiling to ``.ptx`` files
  instead of host object files.

* A :prop_gbl:`GENERATOR_IS_MULTI_CONFIG` global property was
  added to determine whether the current generator is a multi-configuration
  generator (such as :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` or :generator:`Xcode`).

* The :prop_tgt:`INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION` target property is now enforced
  when enabled.  CMake will add IPO flags unconditionally or produce an error
  if it does not know the flags for the current compiler.  The project is now
  responsible to use the :module:`CheckIPOSupported` module to check for IPO
  support before enabling the target property.  See policy :policy:`CMP0069`.

* The :prop_tgt:`WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS` target property may now
  be used in combination with explicit ``.def`` files in order to
  export all symbols from the object files within a target plus
  an explicit list of symbols that the linker finds in dependencies
  (e.g. ``msvcrt.lib``).

Modules
-------

* A :module:`CheckIPOSupported` module was added to help projects
  check whether interprocedural optimization (IPO) is supported by
  the current toolchain and CMake version.

* The :module:`CMakeFindDependencyMacro` module ``find_dependency`` macro
  now forwards all arguments to the underlying :command:`find_package`
  call.  Existing uses will continue to function as before, but callers can
  now access the full suite of arguments that ``find_package`` accepts.

* The :module:`FeatureSummary` module :command:`feature_summary` command now
  accepts the new ``DEFAULT_DESCRIPTION`` option that will print the default
  title for the selected package type.

* The :module:`FeatureSummary` module gained a new
  :variable:`FeatureSummary_<TYPE>_DESCRIPTION` variable that can be defined
  for each ``<TYPE>`` to replace the type name with the specified string
  whenever the package type is used in an output string by the module.

* The :module:`FindDoxygen` module learned to control Doxygen behavior using
  CMake variables and generate documentation via the newly added
  :command:`doxygen_add_docs` function. The Doxygen input file (``Doxyfile``)
  is automatically generated and doxygen is run as part of a custom target.
  Additional components can be specified to find optional tools: ``dot``,
  ``mscgen`` and ``dia``.

* The :module:`FindMPI` module now provides imported targets.

* The :module:`FindProtobuf` module :command:`protobuf_generate_cpp`
  command gained an ``EXPORT_MACRO`` option to specify the name of
  a DLL export markup macro.

* The :module:`FindProtobuf` module now supports usage of static libraries
  for Unix via a new ``Protobuf_USE_STATIC_LIBS`` input variable.

* The :module:`FindProtobuf` module now provides imported targets
  when the libraries are found.

* A new :module:`GoogleTest` module was added to provide the
  :command:`gtest_add_tests` function independently of the :module:`FindGTest`
  module. The function was also updated to support keyword arguments, with
  functionality expanded to allow a test name prefix and suffix to be
  specified, the dependency on the source files to be optional and the list of
  discovered test cases to be returned to the caller.

CTest
-----

* The :command:`ctest_submit` command gained a ``HTTPHEADER`` option
  to specify custom headers to send during submission.

* The :manual:`ctest(1)` executable gained new options which allow the
  developer to disable automatically adding tests to the test set to satisfy
  fixture dependencies. ``-FS`` prevents adding setup tests for fixtures
  matching the provided regular expression, ``-FC`` prevents adding cleanup
  tests for matching fixtures and ``-FA`` prevents adding any test for matching
  fixtures.

* A :prop_test:`DISABLED` test property was added to mark tests that
  are configured but explicitly disabled so they do not run.

CPack
-----

* The :module:`CPackArchive` module learned to modify the filename
  per-component.  See the :variable:`CPACK_ARCHIVE_FILE_NAME` variable and
  its per-component version :variable:`CPACK_ARCHIVE_<component>_FILE_NAME`.

* The :module:`CPackComponent` module :command:`cpack_add_component` command
  gained a new ``PLIST <filename>`` option to specify the ``pkgbuild``
  ``--component-plist`` argument when using the
  :module:`productbuild <CPackProductBuild>` generator.

* The :module:`CPackIFW` module :command:`cpack_ifw_configure_component` and
  :command:`cpack_ifw_configure_component_group` commands gained
  internationalization support for ``DISPLAY_NAME`` and ``DESCRIPTION``
  options.

* The :module:`CPackIFW` module learned the new hint :variable:`CPACK_IFW_ROOT`
  variable for finding the QtIFW tool suite installed in a non-standard place.

* The :module:`CPackProductBuild` module gained a new
  :variable:`CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_RESOURCES_DIR` variable to
  specify resources to be copied into the ``Resources``
  directory.

* The :module:`CPackRPM` module learned to modify the ``debuginfo`` package
  name.  See the :variable:`CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_FILE_NAME` variable.

* The :module:`CPackWIX` module patching system now has the ability to set
  additional attributes.  This can be done by specifying attributes with
  the ``CPackWiXFragment`` XML tag after the ``Id`` attribute.
  See the :variable:`CPACK_WIX_PATCH_FILE` variable.

* The CPack WIX generator implemented a new
  :variable:`CPACK_WIX_ROOT_FOLDER_ID` variable which allows
  using a custom root folder ID instead of the default
  ``ProgramFilesFolder`` / ``ProgramFiles64Folder``.

Other
-----

* Interprocedural optimization (IPO) is now supported for GNU and Clang
  compilers using link time optimization (LTO) flags.  See the
  :prop_tgt:`INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION` target property and
  :module:`CheckIPOSupported` module.

* The ``TARGET_OBJECTS``
  :manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
  is now supported by the :command:`add_custom_command` and
  :command:`file(GENERATE)` commands.

* Two new informational generator expressions to retrieve Apple Bundle
  directories have been added. The first one ``$<TARGET_BUNDLE_DIR:tgt>``
  outputs the full path to the Bundle directory, the other one
  ``$<TARGET_BUNDLE_CONTENT_DIR:tgt>`` outputs the full path to the
  ``Contents`` directory of macOS Bundles and App Bundles. For all other
  bundle types and SDKs it is identical with ``$<TARGET_BUNDLE_DIR:tgt>``.
  The new expressions are helpful to query Bundle locations independent of
  the different Bundle types and layouts on macOS and iOS.

Deprecated and Removed Features
===============================

* An explicit deprecation diagnostic was added for policies ``CMP0036``
  and below.  The :manual:`cmake-policies(7)` manual explains that the
  OLD behaviors of all policies are deprecated and that projects should
  always port to the NEW behaviors as soon as possible.

* The :generator:`Visual Studio 8 2005` generator is now deprecated
  and will be removed in a future version of CMake.

* The :generator:`Visual Studio 7 .NET 2003` generator has been removed.

* The :generator:`Xcode` generator dropped support for Xcode versions
  older than 3.

* The :module:`FindDoxygen` module has deprecated several variables.

* The version of curl bundled with CMake no longer accepts URLs of the form
  ``file://c:/...`` on Windows due to a change in upstream curl 7.52.  Use
  the form ``file:///c:/...`` instead to work on all versions.

Other Changes
=============

* When using :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC`, CMake now scans for the presence of the
  ``Q_PLUGIN_METADATA`` macro and reruns moc when the file from the
  macro's ``FILE`` argument changes.

* When :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` detects an include statement of the form
  ``#include "moc_<basename>.cpp"`` the search for the respective header file
  now looks in the :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` of the target as well.

* When running tests, CTest learned to treat skipped tests (using the
  :prop_test:`SKIP_RETURN_CODE` property) the same as tests with the new
  :prop_test:`DISABLED` property. Due to this change, CTest will not indicate
  failure when all tests are either skipped or pass.

* The :generator:`Ninja` generator has loosened the dependencies of object
  compilation.  Object compilation now depends only on custom targets
  and custom commands associated with libraries on which the object's target
  depends and no longer depends on the libraries themselves.  Source files
  in dependent targets may now compile without waiting for their targets'
  dependencies to link.

* On macOS, ``RPATH`` settings such as :prop_tgt:`BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH`
  no longer affect the ``install_name`` field.  See policy :policy:`CMP0068`.

* The :generator:`Visual Studio 14 2015` generator has been taught about
  a change to the ``v140`` toolset made by a VS 2015 update.  VS changed
  the set of values it understands for the ``GenerateDebugInformation``
  linker setting that produces the ``-DEBUG`` linker flag variants.

Updates
=======

Changes made since CMake 3.9.0 include the following.

3.9.1
-----

* The ``find_`` command ``PACKAGE_ROOT`` search path group added by
  CMake 3.9.0 has been removed for the 3.9 series due to regressions
  caused by new use of ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` variables.  The behavior
  may be re-introduced in the future in a more-compatible way.

3.9.2
-----

* On macOS, the default application bundle ``Info.plist`` file no longer
  enables Hi-DPI support as it did in 3.9.0 and 3.9.1.  The change had
  to be reverted because it broke iOS applications.

* The Xcode generator no longer adds "outputPaths" to custom script
  build phases as it did in 3.9.0 and 3.9.1.  This was added in an
  attempt to support Xcode 9's new build system, but broke incremental
  rebuilds for both the old and new Xcode build systems.

Changes made since CMake 3.0 include the following.

Documentation Changes
=====================

* A new :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual was added.

New Features
============

Generators
----------

* The :generator:`Visual Studio 14 2015` generator was added.

Windows Phone and Windows Store
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Generators for Visual Studio 11 (2012) and above learned to generate
  projects for Windows Phone and Windows Store.  One may set the
  :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` variable to ``WindowsPhone``
  or ``WindowsStore`` on the :manual:`cmake(1)` command-line
  or in a :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` to activate these platforms.
  Also set :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION` to ``8.0`` or ``8.1`` to
  specify the version of Windows to be targeted.

NVIDIA Nsight Tegra
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Generators for Visual Studio 10 (2010) and above learned to generate
  projects for NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual Studio Edition.  One may set
  the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` variable to ``Android`` on the
  :manual:`cmake(1)` command-line or in a :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`
  to activate this platform.

Syntax
------

* The :manual:`cmake-language(7)` syntax for :ref:`Variable References` and
  :ref:`Escape Sequences` was simplified in order to allow a much faster
  implementation.  See policy :policy:`CMP0053`.

* The :command:`if` command no longer automatically dereferences
  variables named in quoted or bracket arguments.  See policy
  :policy:`CMP0054`.

Commands
--------

* The :command:`add_custom_command` command learned to interpret
  :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` in arguments to ``DEPENDS``.

* The :command:`export(PACKAGE)` command learned to check the
  :variable:`CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY` variable to skip
  exporting the package.

* The :command:`file(STRINGS)` command gained a new ``ENCODING``
  option to enable extraction of ``UTF-8`` strings.

* The :command:`find_package` command learned to check the
  :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY` and
  :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`
  variables to skip searching the package registries.

* The :command:`get_property` command learned a new ``INSTALL`` scope
  for properties.

* The :command:`install` command learned a ``MESSAGE_NEVER`` option
  to avoid output during installation.

* The :command:`set_property` command learned a new ``INSTALL`` scope
  for properties.

* The :command:`string` command learned a new ``GENEX_STRIP`` subcommand
  which removes
  :manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.

* The :command:`string` command learned a new ``UUID`` subcommand
  to generate a univerally unique identifier.

* New :command:`target_compile_features` command allows populating the
  :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_FEATURES` target property, just like any other
  build variable.

* The :command:`target_sources` command was added to add to the
  :prop_tgt:`SOURCES` target property.

Variables
---------

* The Visual Studio generators for versions 8 (2005) and above
  learned to read the target platform name from a new
  :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM` variable when it is
  not specified as part of the generator name.  The platform
  name may be specified on the :manual:`cmake(1)` command line
  with the ``-A`` option, e.g. ``-G "Visual Studio 12 2013" -A x64``.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET` variable may now be
  initialized in a toolchain file specified by the
  :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` variable.  This is useful
  when cross-compiling with the Xcode or Visual Studio
  generators.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_MESSAGE` variable was introduced to
  optionally reduce output installation.

Properties
----------

* New :prop_tgt:`CXX_STANDARD` and :prop_tgt:`CXX_EXTENSIONS` target
  properties may specify values which CMake uses to compute required
  compile options such as ``-std=c++11`` or ``-std=gnu++11``. The
  :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` and :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS`
  variables may be set to initialize the target properties.

* New :prop_tgt:`C_STANDARD` and :prop_tgt:`C_EXTENSIONS` target
  properties may specify values which CMake uses to compute required
  compile options such as ``-std=c11`` or ``-std=gnu11``. The
  :variable:`CMAKE_C_STANDARD` and :variable:`CMAKE_C_EXTENSIONS`
  variables may be set to initialize the target properties.

* New :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_FEATURES` target property may contain a list
  of features required to compile a target.  CMake uses this
  information to ensure that the compiler in use is capable of building
  the target, and to add any necessary compile flags to support language
  features.

* New :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_PDB_NAME` and
  :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` target properties
  were introduced to specify the MSVC compiler program database
  file location (``cl /Fd``).  This complements the existing
  :prop_tgt:`PDB_NAME` and :prop_tgt:`PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`
  target properties that specify the linker program database
  file location (``link /pdb``).

* The :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` target property now supports
  a ``$<LINK_ONLY:...>``
  :manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.

* A new :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_SOURCES` target property was introduced. This is
  consumed by dependent targets, which compile and link the listed sources.

* The :prop_tgt:`SOURCES` target property now contains
  :manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
  such as ``TARGET_OBJECTS`` when read at configure time, if
  policy :policy:`CMP0051` is ``NEW``.

* The :prop_tgt:`SOURCES` target property now generally supports
  :manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.  The
  generator expressions may be used in the :command:`add_library` and
  :command:`add_executable` commands.

* It is now possible to write and append to the :prop_tgt:`SOURCES` target
  property.  The :variable:`CMAKE_DEBUG_TARGET_PROPERTIES` variable may be
  used to trace the origin of sources.

* A :prop_sf:`VS_DEPLOYMENT_CONTENT` source file property was added
  to tell the Visual Studio generators to mark content for deployment
  in Windows Phone and Windows Store projects.

* A :prop_sf:`VS_DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION` source file property was added
  to tell the Visual Studio generators the relative location of content
  marked for deployment in Windows Phone and Windows Store projects.

* The :prop_tgt:`VS_WINRT_COMPONENT` target property was created to
  tell Visual Studio generators to compile a shared library as a
  Windows Runtime (WinRT) component.

* The :generator:`Xcode` generator learned to check source
  file properties  :prop_sf:`XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE` and
  :prop_sf:`XCODE_LAST_KNOWN_FILE_TYPE` for a custom Xcode
  file reference type.

Modules
-------

* The :module:`BundleUtilities` module learned to resolve and replace
  ``@rpath`` placeholders on OS X to correctly bundle applications
  using them.

* The :module:`CMakePackageConfigHelpers` module
  :command:`configure_package_config_file` command learned a new
  ``INSTALL_PREFIX`` option to generate package configuration files
  meant for a prefix other than :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.

* The :module:`CheckFortranSourceCompiles` module was added to
  provide a ``CHECK_Fortran_SOURCE_COMPILES`` macro.

* The :module:`ExternalData` module learned to tolerate a ``DATA{}``
  reference to a missing source file with a warning instead of
  rejecting it with an error.  This helps developers write new
  ``DATA{}`` references to test reference outputs that have not
  yet been created.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module learned to support lzma-compressed
  source tarballs with ``.7z``, ``.tar.xz``, and ``.txz`` extensions.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module ``ExternalProject_Add`` command
  learned a new ``BUILD_ALWAYS`` option to cause the external project
  build step to run every time the host project is built.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module ``ExternalProject_Add`` command
  learned a new ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` option to cause the external
  project target to have the :prop_tgt:`EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL` target
  property set.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module ``ExternalProject_Add_Step`` command
  learned a new ``EXCLUDE_FROM_MAIN`` option to cause the step to not be
  a direct dependency of the main external project target.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module ``ExternalProject_Add`` command
  learned a new ``DOWNLOAD_NO_PROGRESS`` option to disable progress
  output while downloading the source tarball.

* The :module:`FeatureSummary` module ``feature_summary`` API
  learned to accept multiple values for the ``WHAT`` option and
  combine them appropriately.

* The :module:`FindCUDA` module learned to support ``fatbin`` and ``cubin``
  modules.

* The :module:`FindGTest` module ``gtest_add_tests`` macro learned
  a new ``AUTO`` option to automatically read the :prop_tgt:`SOURCES`
  target property of the test executable and scan the source files
  for tests to be added.

* The :module:`FindGLEW` module now provides imported targets.

* The :module:`FindGLUT` module now provides imported targets.

* The :module:`FindHg` module gained a new ``Hg_WC_INFO`` macro to
  help run ``hg`` to extract information about a Mercurial work copy.

* The :module:`FindOpenCL` module was introduced.

* The :module:`FindOpenMP` module learned to support Fortran.

* The :module:`FindPkgConfig` module learned to use the ``PKG_CONFIG``
  environment variable value as the ``pkg-config`` executable, if set.

* The :module:`FindXercesC` module was introduced.

* The :module:`FindZLIB` module now provides imported targets.

* The :module:`GenerateExportHeader` module ``generate_export_header``
  function learned to allow use with :ref:`Object Libraries`.

* The :module:`InstallRequiredSystemLibraries` module gained a new
  ``CMAKE_INSTALL_OPENMP_LIBRARIES`` option to install MSVC OpenMP
  runtime libraries.

* The :module:`UseSWIG` module learned to detect the module name
  from ``.i`` source files if possible to avoid the need to set
  the ``SWIG_MODULE_NAME`` source file property explicitly.

* The :module:`WriteCompilerDetectionHeader` module was added to allow
  creation of a portable header file for compiler optional feature detection.

Generator Expressions
---------------------

* New ``COMPILE_FEATURES``
  :manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` allows
  setting build properties based on available compiler features.

CTest
-----

* The :command:`ctest_coverage` command learned to read variable
  ``CTEST_COVERAGE_EXTRA_FLAGS`` to set ``CoverageExtraFlags``.

* The :command:`ctest_coverage` command learned to support
  Intel coverage files with the ``codecov`` tool.

* The :command:`ctest_memcheck` command learned to support sanitizer
  modes, including ``AddressSanitizer``, ``MemorySanitizer``,
  ``ThreadSanitizer``, and ``UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer``.
  Options may be set using the new
  :variable:`CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_SANITIZER_OPTIONS` variable.

CPack
-----

* :manual:`cpack(1)` gained an ``IFW`` generator to package using
  Qt Framework Installer tools.  See the :module:`CPackIFW` module.

* :manual:`cpack(1)` gained ``7Z`` and ``TXZ`` generators supporting
  lzma-compressed archives.

* The :module:`CPackDeb` module learned a new
  :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_COMPRESSION_TYPE` variable to set the
  tarball compression type.

* The :manual:`cpack(1)` ``WiX`` generator learned to support
  a :prop_inst:`CPACK_WIX_ACL` installed file property to
  specify an Access Control List.

Other
-----

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-E`` option learned a new ``env`` command.

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-E tar`` command learned to support
  lzma-compressed files.

* :ref:`Object Libraries` may now have extra sources that do not
  compile to object files so long as they would not affect linking
  of a normal library (e.g. ``.dat`` is okay but not ``.def``).

* Visual Studio generators for VS 8 and later learned to support
  the ``ASM_MASM`` language.

* The Visual Studio generators learned to treat ``.hlsl`` source
  files as High Level Shading Language sources (using ``FXCompile``
  in ``.vcxproj`` files).  Source file properties
  :prop_sf:`VS_SHADER_TYPE`, :prop_sf:`VS_SHADER_MODEL`, and
  :prop_sf:`VS_SHADER_ENTRYPOINT` were added added to specify the
  shader type, model, and entry point name.

New Diagnostics
===============

* Policy :policy:`CMP0052` introduced to control directories in the
  :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` of exported targets.

Deprecated and Removed Features
===============================

* In CMake 3.0 the :command:`target_link_libraries` command
  accidentally began allowing unquoted arguments to use
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
  containing a (``;`` separated) list within them.  For example::

    set(libs B C)
    target_link_libraries(A PUBLIC $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${libs}>)

  This is equivalent to writing::

    target_link_libraries(A PUBLIC $<BUILD_INTERFACE:B C>)

  and was never intended to work.  It did not work in CMake 2.8.12.
  Such generator expressions should be in quoted arguments::

    set(libs B C)
    target_link_libraries(A PUBLIC "$<BUILD_INTERFACE:${libs}>")

  CMake 3.1 again requires the quotes for this to work correctly.

* Prior to CMake 3.1 the Makefile generators did not escape ``#``
  correctly inside make variable assignments used in generated
  makefiles, causing them to be treated as comments.  This made
  code like::

    add_compile_options(-Wno-#pragma-messages)

  not work in Makefile generators, but work in other generators.
  Now it is escaped correctly, making the behavior consistent
  across generators.  However, some projects may have tried to
  workaround the original bug with code like::

    set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} -Wno-\\#pragma-messages")

  This added the needed escape for Makefile generators but also
  caused other generators to pass ``-Wno-\#pragma-messages`` to
  the shell, which would work only in POSIX shells.
  Unfortunately the escaping fix could not be made in a compatible
  way so this platform- and generator-specific workaround no
  longer works.  Project code may test the :variable:`CMAKE_VERSION`
  variable value to make the workaround version-specific too.

* Callbacks established by the :command:`variable_watch` command will no
  longer receive the ``ALLOWED_UNKNOWN_READ_ACCESS`` access type when
  the undocumented ``CMAKE_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_VARIABLE_READ_ACCESS`` variable is
  set.  Uninitialized variable accesses will always be reported as
  ``UNKNOWN_READ_ACCESS``.

* The :module:`CMakeDetermineVSServicePack` module now warns that
  it is deprecated and should not longer be used.  Use the
  :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION` variable instead.

* The :module:`FindITK` module has been removed altogether.
  It was a thin-wrapper around ``find_package(ITK ... NO_MODULE)``.
  This produces much clearer error messages when ITK is not found.

* The :module:`FindVTK` module has been removed altogether.
  It was a thin-wrapper around ``find_package(VTK ... NO_MODULE)``.
  This produces much clearer error messages when VTK is not found.

  The module also provided compatibility support for finding VTK 4.0.
  This capability has been dropped.

Other Changes
=============

* The :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` learned to capture output from child
  processes started by the :command:`execute_process` command
  and display it in the output window.

* The :manual:`cmake-language(7)` internal implementation of generator
  expression and list expansion parsers have been optimized and shows
  non-trivial speedup on large projects.

* The Makefile generators learned to use response files with GNU tools
  on Windows to pass library directories and names to the linker.

* When generating linker command-lines, CMake now avoids repeating
  items corresponding to SHARED library targets.

* Support for the Open Watcom compiler has been overhauled.
  The :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` is now ``OpenWatcom``,
  and the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION` now uses
  the Open Watcom external version numbering.  The external
  version numbers are lower than the internal version number
  by 11.

* The ``cmake-mode.el`` major Emacs editing mode no longer
  treats ``_`` as part of words, making it more consistent
  with other major modes.

CMake 3.12 Release Notes
************************

.. only:: html

  .. contents::

Changes made since CMake 3.11 include the following.

New Features
============

Generators
----------

* The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2017 learned to support a
  ``version=14.##`` option in the :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`
  value (e.g. via the :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-T`` option) to specify a
  toolset version number.

Command-Line
------------

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` :ref:`Build Tool Mode` (``cmake --build``) gained
  ``--parallel [<jobs>]`` and ``-j [<jobs>]`` options to specify a parallel
  build level.  They map to corresponding options of the native build tool.

Commands
--------

* The :command:`add_compile_definitions` command was added to set preprocessor
  definitions at directory level.  This supersedes :command:`add_definitions`.

* The :command:`cmake_minimum_required` and :command:`cmake_policy(VERSION)`
  commands now accept a version range using the form ``<min>[...<max>]``.
  The ``<min>`` version is required but policies are set based on the
  ``<max>`` version.  This allows projects to specify a range of versions
  for which they have been updated and avoid explicit policy settings.

* The :command:`file(GLOB)` and :command:`file(GLOB_RECURSE)` commands
  learned a new flag ``CONFIGURE_DEPENDS`` which enables expression of
  build system dependency on globbed directory's contents.

* The :command:`file(TOUCH)` and :command:`file(TOUCH_NOCREATE)` commands
  were added to expose ``TOUCH`` functionality without having to use
  CMake's command-line tool mode with :command:`execute_process`.

* The :command:`find_package` command now searches a prefix specified by
  a ``PackageName_ROOT`` CMake or environment variable.  Package roots are
  maintained as a stack so nested calls to all ``find_*`` commands inside
  find modules also search the roots as prefixes.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0074`.

* The :command:`install` command learned an optional ``NAMELINK_COMPONENT``
  parameter, which allows you to change the component for a shared library's
  namelink. If none is specified, the value of ``COMPONENT`` is used by
  default.

* The :command:`list` command learned a ``JOIN`` sub-command
  to concatenate list's elements separated by a glue string.

* The :command:`list` command learned a ``SUBLIST`` sub-command
  to get a sublist of the list.

* The :command:`list` command learned a ``TRANSFORM`` sub-command
  to apply various string transformation to list's elements.

* The :command:`project` command learned an optional ``HOMEPAGE_URL``
  parameter which has the effect of setting variables like
  :variable:`PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL`, :variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_HOMEPAGE_URL`
  and :variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL`.

* The :command:`string` command learned a ``JOIN`` sub-command
  to concatenate input strings separated by a glue string.

* :command:`target_compile_options` and :command:`add_compile_options`
  commands gained a ``SHELL:`` prefix to specify a group of related
  options using shell-like quoting.

* The :command:`target_link_libraries` command now supports
  :ref:`Object Libraries`.  Linking to an object library uses its object
  files in direct dependents and also propagates usage requirements.

* The :command:`target_link_libraries` command may now be called
  to modify targets created outside the current directory.

Variables
---------

* The :variable:`CMAKE_FOLDER` variable was added to initialize the
  :prop_tgt:`FOLDER` property on all targets.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION` variable
  was defined to initialize all
  :prop_tgt:`DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION` target properties.

* ``CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION*`` variables have been introduced:

  - :variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION`
  - :variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR`
  - :variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR`
  - :variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH`
  - :variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_TWEAK`

* The :variable:`CMAKE_SUPPRESS_REGENERATION` variable was extended to
  support the :generator:`Ninja` and :ref:`Makefile Generators`.
  It is also now documented.

* ``CMAKE_VS_SDK_*_DIRECTORIES`` variables were defined to tell
  :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above how to populate
  fields in ``.vcxproj`` files that specify SDK directories.  The
  variables are:

  - :variable:`CMAKE_VS_SDK_EXCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`
  - :variable:`CMAKE_VS_SDK_EXECUTABLE_DIRECTORIES`
  - :variable:`CMAKE_VS_SDK_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`
  - :variable:`CMAKE_VS_SDK_LIBRARY_DIRECTORIES`
  - :variable:`CMAKE_VS_SDK_LIBRARY_WINRT_DIRECTORIES`
  - :variable:`CMAKE_VS_SDK_REFERENCE_DIRECTORIES`
  - :variable:`CMAKE_VS_SDK_SOURCE_DIRECTORIES`

* A :variable:`MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION` variable was added to provide the
  MSVC toolset version associated with the current MSVC compiler version
  in :variable:`MSVC_VERSION`.

Properties
----------

* The :prop_tgt:`COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME` target property was introduced
  to configure the use of managed C++ for :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`
  for VS 2010 and above.
  A corresponding :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME` target
  property was added to support ``C++/CLI`` for imported targets.

* The :prop_tgt:`DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION` target property
  was introduced as replacement for
  :prop_tgt:`VS_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION`, which is considered
  deprecated now.

* An :prop_tgt:`EXPORT_PROPERTIES` target property was added to specify a
  custom list of target properties to include in targets exported by the
  :command:`install(EXPORT)` and :command:`export` commands.

* The :prop_tgt:`PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` property learned to support
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.

* A :prop_dir:`TESTS` directory property was added to hold the list of
  tests defined by the :command:`add_test` command.

* A :prop_tgt:`VS_DEBUGGER_COMMAND` target property was created to set the
  debugging command line with :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010
  and above.

* HLSL source file properties :prop_sf:`VS_SHADER_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATIONS`
  and :prop_sf:`VS_SHADER_ENABLE_DEBUG` gained support for generator
  expressions.

* HLSL source file property :prop_sf:`VS_SHADER_OBJECT_FILE_NAME` has been
  added to the :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above.
  The property specifies the file name of the compiled shader object.

Modules
-------

* The :module:`FindALSA` module now provides imported targets.

* The :module:`FindCURL` module now provides imported targets.

* The :module:`FindJPEG` module now provides imported targets.

* The :module:`FindLibXml2` module now provides imported targets.

* The :module:`FindMatlab` module now supports the Matlab Runtime
  Compiler (MCR) for compiling and linking matlab extensions.

* A :module:`FindODBC` module was added to find an Open Database Connectivity
  (ODBC) library.

* The :module:`FindPkgConfig` module has learned to export the found
  libraries with full path for direct consumption with the
  :command:`target_link_libraries` command.

* New :module:`FindPython3` and :module:`FindPython2` modules, as well as
  a new :module:`FindPython` module, have been added to provide a new way
  to locate python environments.

* The :module:`UseSWIG` module gained a whole refresh and is now more
  consistent with standard CMake commands to generate libraries and is
  fully configurable through properties.

* The :module:`UseSWIG` module learned to manage multiple behaviors through
  ``UseSWIG_MODULE_VERSION`` variable to ensure legacy support as well as more
  robust handling of ``SWIG`` advanced features (like ``%template``).

* The :module:`UseSWIG` module learned to support CSHARP variant
  wrapper files.

* The :module:`WriteCompilerDetectionHeader` module gained a ``BARE_FEATURES``
  option to add a compatibility define for the exact keyword of a new language
  feature.

Generator Expressions
---------------------

* A new ``$<GENEX_EVAL:...>`` and ``$<TARGET_GENEX_EVAL:target,...>``
  :manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
  has been added to enable consumption of generator expressions whose
  evaluation results itself in generator expressions.

* A new ``$<IN_LIST:...>``
  :manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
  has been added.

* A new ``$<TARGET_EXISTS:...>``
  :manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
  has been added.

* A new ``$<TARGET_NAME_IF_EXISTS:...>``
  :manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
  has been added.

CTest
-----

* The :command:`ctest_start` command has been reworked so that you can simply
  call ``ctest_start(APPEND)`` and it will read all the needed information from
  the TAG file. The argument parsing has also been relaxed so that the order of
  the arguments is less significant.

* A :prop_test:`PROCESSOR_AFFINITY` test property was added to request
  that CTest run a test with CPU affinity for a set of processors
  disjoint from other concurrently running tests with the property set.

CPack
-----

* The :module:`CPack` module now uses variables
  :variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR`,
  :variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR` and
  :variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH`
  to initialize corresponding CPack variables.

* :manual:`cpack(1)` gained basic support for `NuGet`_.
  See the :module:`CPackNuGet` module.

.. _NuGet: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/what-is-nuget

Other
-----

* The :manual:`Compile Features <cmake-compile-features(7)>` functionality
  is now aware of C++ 20.  No specific features are yet enumerated besides
  the ``cxx_std_20`` meta-feature.

* The :manual:`Compile Features <cmake-compile-features(7)>` functionality
  is now aware of the availability of C features in MSVC since VS 2010.

* The :manual:`Compile Features <cmake-compile-features(7)>` functionality
  is now aware of C language standards supported by Texas Instruments C
  compilers.

Deprecated and Removed Features
===============================

* The :generator:`Visual Studio 8 2005` generator has been removed.

* CMake no longer produces ``<tgt>_LIB_DEPENDS`` cache entries
  for library targets.  See policy :policy:`CMP0073`.

Other Changes
=============

* Include flags for directories marked as ``SYSTEM`` are now moved after
  non-system directories.  The ``-isystem`` flag does this automatically,
  so moving them explicitly to the end makes the behavior consistent on
  compilers that do not have any ``-isystem`` flag.

* Fortran dependency scanning now supports dependencies implied by
  `Fortran Submodules`_.

* The existence and functionality of the file
  ``${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/cmake_install.cmake`` has now been documented in the
  :command:`install` documentation so that external packaging software can take
  advantage of CPack-style component installs.

* The :module:`CheckIncludeFile` module ``check_include_file`` macro
  learned to honor the ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES`` variable.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0075`.

* The :module:`CheckIncludeFileCXX` module ``check_include_file_cxx`` macro
  learned to honor the ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES`` variable.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0075`.

* The :module:`CheckIncludeFiles` module ``check_include_files`` macro
  learned to honor the ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES`` variable.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0075`.

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-E copy_directory`` tool now fails when the
  source directory does not exist.  Previously it succeeded by creating
  an empty destination directory.

* The :module:`UseSWIG` module :command:`swig_add_library` command
  (and legacy ``swig_add_module`` command) now set the prefix of
  Java modules to ``""`` for MINGW, MSYS, and CYGWIN environments.

CMake 3.4 Release Notes
***********************

.. only:: html

  .. contents::

Changes made since CMake 3.3 include the following.

New Features
============

Generators
----------

* The :generator:`Visual Studio 14 2015` generator learned to select
  a Windows 10 SDK based on the value of the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION`
  variable and the SDKs available on the host.

* CMake learned rudimentary support for the Apple Swift language.  When using
  the :generator:`Xcode` generator with Xcode 6.1 or higher, one may enable
  the ``Swift`` language with the :command:`enable_language` command or the
  :command:`project` command (this is an error with other generators or when
  Xcode is too old).  Then one may list ``.swift`` source files in targets
  for compilation.

Commands
--------

* The :command:`find_program` command learned a ``NAMES_PER_DIR``
  option to consider all given ``NAMES`` in each directory before
  moving on to the next directory.

* The :command:`get_filename_component` command learned a new ``BASE_DIR``
  subcommand.  This is used to specify a base directory when calculating an
  absolute path from a relative path.

* The :command:`if` command learned a new ``TEST`` operator that evaluates
  to true if a given test name has been defined by the :command:`add_test`
  command.  See policy :policy:`CMP0064`.

* The :command:`install(DIRECTORY)` command ``DESTINATION`` option learned to
  support :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.

* The :command:`install(FILES)` command ``DESTINATION`` option learned to
  support :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.

* The :command:`string` command learned a new ``APPEND`` subcommand.

Variables
---------

* The :ref:`Makefile Generators` and the :generator:`Ninja` generator
  learned to add compiler launcher tools like distcc and ccache along
  with the compiler for ``C`` and ``CXX`` languages.  See the
  :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` variable and
  :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` target property for details.

* New :variable:`CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC` and
  :variable:`CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC` variables were
  introduced to initialize the
  :prop_tgt:`LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC` and
  :prop_tgt:`LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC` target properties,
  respectively.

Properties
----------

* :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` learned to support additional
  target properties to customize projects for NVIDIA Nsight
  Tegra Visual Studio Edition:

  * :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_ANT_ADDITIONAL_OPTIONS`
  * :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_ARCH`
  * :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_ASSETS_DIRECTORIES`
  * :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_JAR_DEPENDENCIES`
  * :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_JAR_DIRECTORIES`
  * :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_JAVA_SOURCE_DIR`
  * :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DEPENDENCIES`
  * :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DIRECTORIES`
  * :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_PROCESS_MAX`
  * :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_PROGUARD`
  * :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_PROGUARD_CONFIG_PATH`
  * :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_SECURE_PROPS_PATH`
  * :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_SKIP_ANT_STEP`
  * :prop_tgt:`ANDROID_STL_TYPE`

* The :prop_tgt:`ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`,
  :prop_tgt:`LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`, and
  :prop_tgt:`RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` target properties learned to
  support :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.

* The :prop_tgt:`SOURCE_DIR` and :prop_tgt:`BINARY_DIR` target properties
  were introduced to allow project code to query where a target is defined.

* The :prop_tgt:`OUTPUT_NAME` target property and its variants learned to
  support :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.

* A :prop_gbl:`TARGET_MESSAGES` global property was added to tell the
  :ref:`Makefile Generators` whether to generate commands to print output
  after each target is completed.

* On Windows with MS-compatible tools, CMake learned to optionally
  generate a module definition (``.def``) file for ``SHARED`` libraries.
  See the :prop_tgt:`WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS` target property.

Modules
-------

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module :command:`ExternalProject_Add`
  function ``GIT_SUBMODULES`` option now also limits the set of
  submodules that are initialized in addition to the prior behavior
  of limiting the set of submodules that are updated.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module learned new ``USES_TERMINAL``
  arguments for giving steps exclusive terminal access.  This is
  useful with the :generator:`Ninja` generator to monitor CMake
  superbuild progress and prevent CPU oversubscription.

* The :module:`FindBISON` module ``BISON_TARGET`` macro learned a
  new ``DEFINES_FILE`` option to specify a custom output header
  to be generated.

* The :module:`FindHDF5` module learend a new ``HDF5_PREFER_PARALLEL``
  option allowing users to specify that a parallel HDF5 tool is
  preferred if both are available.

* The :module:`FindIce` module now provides imported targets.

* The :module:`FindJava` module learned to optionally find
  the ``idlj`` and ``jarsigner`` tools.

* The :module:`FindOpenSSL` module now provides imported targets.

* The :module:`FindOpenSSL` module learned a new ``OPENSSL_USE_STATIC_LIBS``
  option to search only for static libraries.

* The :module:`FindPkgConfig` learned a new :command:`pkg_get_variable`
  command which may be used to query for arbitrary variables from a package
  (such as for related tools or data and plugin install paths).

* The :module:`FindProtobuf` module gained a new
  :command:`protobuf_generate_python` function to generate python
  sources from ``.proto`` files.

* The :module:`FindTIFF` module learned to search separately for
  debug and release variants.

* The :module:`FindwxWidgets` module learned to support version requests.

* The :module:`FindXercesC` module learned to search separately for
  debug and release variants.

* The :module:`FindZLIB` module learned to search separately for
  debug and release variants.

* The :module:`GNUInstallDirs` module learned special default values
  for certain installation prefixes according to the `GNU Coding
  Standards`_ and the `Filesystem Hierarchy Standard`_.

* The :module:`UseJava` module ``add_jar`` function learned
  to support response files (e.g. ``@srcs.txt``) for source
  specification.

* The :module:`UseJava` module ``install_jar`` function learned
  new ``DESTINATION`` and ``COMPONENT`` options to specify
  the corresponding :command:`install` command options.

* The :module:`UseJava` module gained a new ``create_javah``
  function to create C headers from Java classes.

.. _`GNU Coding Standards`: https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html
.. _`Filesystem Hierarchy Standard`: https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/index.html

Generator Expressions
---------------------

* A new ``$<SHELL_PATH:...>``
  :manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
  has been added.

CTest
-----

* CTest learned to optionally measure the CPU load during parallel
  testing and avoid starting tests that may cause the load to exceed
  a given threshold.  See the :manual:`ctest(1)` command ``--test-load``
  option, the ``TestLoad`` setting of the :ref:`CTest Test Step`,
  the :variable:`CTEST_TEST_LOAD` variable, and the ``TEST_LOAD``
  option of the :command:`ctest_test` command.

* :manual:`ctest(1)` learned options
  ``--test-output-size-passed`` and ``--test-output-size-failed``
  to customize the limit on test output size submitted when
  running as a :ref:`Dashboard Client`.

CPack
-----

* The :module:`CPackDeb` module learned to set package dependencies
  per component.  See variables:

  * :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_BREAKS`
  * :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_CONFLICTS`
  * :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_ENHANCES`
  * :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_PREDEPENDS`
  * :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_PROVIDES`
  * :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_RECOMMENDS`
  * :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_REPLACES`
  * :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_SUGGESTS`

* The :module:`CPack` module learned to package empty directories.

* The :module:`CPack` module gained a new setting, ``CPACK_VERBATIM_VARIABLES``,
  which can be used to ensure the cpack program receives the settings' values
  exactly as they were set, even if they contain CMake-special characters.
  For compatibility, it's off by default.

Other
-----

* The :manual:`Compile Features <cmake-compile-features(7)>` functionality
  is now aware of features supported by GNU C compilers on Windows.

* CMake learned to honor ``*.manifest`` source files with MSVC tools.
  Manifest files named as sources of ``.exe`` and ``.dll`` targets
  will be merged with linker-generated manifests and embedded in the
  binary.

* The `Concurrent Fortran 77 <https://ccur.com>`__ compiler is now supported.
  Its :variable:`compiler id <CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID>` is ``CCur``.

* :manual:`cmake(1)` gained a new ``--trace-expand`` command line option
  that is like ``--trace`` but expands variable references in the output.

Deprecated and Removed Features
===============================

* The :module:`CMakeExpandImportedTargets` module is now documented
  as deprecated.  See module documentation for an explanation.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS` variable no longer has any
  effect.  Previously it was partially implemented and unreliable.

Other Changes
=============

* The :module:`CheckFunctionExists`, :module:`CheckLibraryExists`,
  :module:`CheckSymbolExists`, and :module:`FindThreads` modules learned to
  work in environments where only CXX is enabled.

* The :module:`CPackDeb` module now correctly excludes symlinks during package
  checksum calculation.

* The :module:`CPackDeb` no longer uses fakeroot and system tar program for
  packaging.

* The :module:`CPack` module no longer mangles settings with CMake-special
  characters when they're used as defaults for other settings. The macro
  ``cpack_set_if_not_set``, which was responsible for this, is now deprecated.

* CMake no longer links executables with flags to export symbols
  unless the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property is set.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0065`.

* The ``SONAME`` field is no longer set for ``MODULE`` libraries
  created with the :command:`add_library` command.  ``MODULE``
  libraries are meant for explicit dynamic loading at runtime.
  They cannot be linked so ``SONAME`` is not useful.

* The internal :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILE_OBJECT` rule variable now
  substitutes compiler include flags in a separate ``<INCLUDES>`` placeholder
  instead of the main ``<FLAGS>`` placeholder.
CMake 3.0 Release Notes
***********************

.. only:: html

  .. contents::

Changes made since CMake 2.8.12 include the following.

Documentation Changes
=====================

* The CMake documentation has been converted to reStructuredText and
  now transforms via Sphinx (`<http://sphinx-doc.org>`__) into man and
  html pages.  This allows the documentation to be properly indexed
  and to contain cross-references.

  Conversion from the old internal documentation format was done by
  an automatic process so some documents may still contain artifacts.
  They will be updated incrementally over time.

  A basic reStructuredText processor has been implemented to support
  ``cmake --help-command`` and similar command-line options.

* New manuals were added:

  - :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)`
  - :manual:`cmake-commands(7)`, replacing ``cmakecommands(1)``
    and ``cmakecompat(1)``
  - :manual:`cmake-developer(7)`
  - :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
  - :manual:`cmake-generators(7)`
  - :manual:`cmake-language(7)`
  - :manual:`cmake-modules(7)`, replacing ``cmakemodules(1)``
  - :manual:`cmake-packages(7)`
  - :manual:`cmake-policies(7)`, replacing ``cmakepolicies(1)``
  - :manual:`cmake-properties(7)`, replacing ``cmakeprops(1)``
  - :manual:`cmake-qt(7)`
  - :manual:`cmake-toolchains(7)`
  - :manual:`cmake-variables(7)`, replacing ``cmakevars(1)``

* Release notes for CMake 3.0.0 and above will now be included with
  the html documentation.

New Features
============

Syntax
------

* The CMake language has been extended with
  :ref:`Bracket Argument` and  :ref:`Bracket Comment`
  syntax inspired by Lua long brackets::

    set(x [===[bracket argument]===] #[[bracket comment]])

  Content between equal-length open- and close-brackets is taken
  literally with no variable replacements.

  .. warning::
    This syntax change could not be made in a fully compatible
    way.  No policy is possible because syntax parsing occurs before
    any chance to set a policy.  Existing code using an unquoted
    argument that starts with an open bracket will be interpreted
    differently without any diagnostic.  Fortunately the syntax is
    obscure enough that this problem is unlikely in practice.

Generators
----------

* A new :generator:`CodeLite` extra generator is available
  for use with the Makefile or Ninja generators.

* A new :generator:`Kate` extra generator is available
  for use with the Makefile or Ninja generators.

* The :generator:`Ninja` generator learned to use ``ninja`` job pools
  when specified by a new :prop_gbl:`JOB_POOLS` global property.

Commands
--------

* The :command:`add_library` command learned a new ``INTERFACE``
  library type.  Interface libraries have no build rules but may
  have properties defining
  :manual:`usage requirements <cmake-buildsystem(7)>`
  and may be installed, exported, and imported.  This is useful to
  create header-only libraries that have concrete link dependencies
  on other libraries.

* The :command:`export()` command learned a new ``EXPORT`` mode that
  retrieves the list of targets to export from an export set configured
  by the :command:`install(TARGETS)` command ``EXPORT`` option.  This
  makes it easy to export from the build tree the same targets that
  are exported from the install tree.

* The :command:`export` command learned to work with multiple dependent
  export sets, thus allowing multiple packages to be built and exported
  from a single tree.  The feature requires CMake to wait until the
  generation step to write the output file.  This means one should not
  :command:`include` the generated targets file later during project
  configuration because it will not be available.
  Use :ref:`Alias Targets` instead.  See policy :policy:`CMP0024`.

* The :command:`install(FILES)` command learned to support
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
  in the list of files.

* The :command:`project` command learned to set some version variables
  to values specified by the new ``VERSION`` option or to empty strings.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0048`.

* The :command:`string` command learned a new ``CONCAT`` mode.
  It is particularly useful in combination with the new
  :ref:`Bracket Argument` syntax.

* The :command:`unset` command learned a ``PARENT_SCOPE`` option
  matching that of the :command:`set` command.

* The :command:`include_external_msproject` command learned
  to handle non-C++ projects like ``.vbproj`` or ``.csproj``.

* The :command:`ctest_update` command learned to update work trees
  managed by the Perforce (p4) version control tool.

* The :command:`message` command learned a ``DEPRECATION`` mode. Such
  messages are not issued by default, but may be issued as a warning if
  :variable:`CMAKE_WARN_DEPRECATED` is enabled, or as an error if
  :variable:`CMAKE_ERROR_DEPRECATED` is enabled.

* The :command:`target_link_libraries` command now allows repeated use of
  the ``LINK_PUBLIC`` and ``LINK_PRIVATE`` keywords.

Variables
---------

* Variable :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX` has been
  introduced to tell CMake not to add the value of
  :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to the
  :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH` variable by default.
  This is useful when building a project that installs some
  of its own dependencies to avoid finding files it is about
  to replace.

* Variable :variable:`CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX` was introduced for use
  when cross-compiling to specify an installation prefix on the
  host system that differs from a :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`
  value meant for the target system.

* Variable :variable:`CMAKE_SYSROOT` was introduced to specify the
  toolchain SDK installation prefix, typically for cross-compiling.
  This is used to pass a ``--sysroot`` option to the compiler and
  as a prefix searched by ``find_*`` commands.

* Variable :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_TARGET` was introduced
  for use when cross-compiling to specify the target platform in the
  :ref:`toolchain file <Cross Compiling Toolchain>` specified by the
  :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` variable.
  This is used to pass an option such as ``--target=<triple>`` to some
  cross-compiling compiler drivers.

* Variable :variable:`CMAKE_MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>` has been
  introduced to optionally initialize the
  :prop_tgt:`MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>` target property.

Properties
----------

* The :prop_dir:`ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES` directory property
  learned to support
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.

* A new directory property :prop_dir:`CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS`
  was introduced to allow projects to specify additional
  files on which the configuration process depends.  CMake will
  re-run at build time when one of these files is modified.
  Previously this was only possible to achieve by specifying
  such files as the input to a :command:`configure_file` command.

* A new :ref:`Qt AUTORCC` feature replaces the need to
  invoke ``qt4_add_resources()`` by allowing ``.qrc`` files to
  be listed as target sources.

* A new :ref:`Qt AUTOUIC` feature replaces the need to
  invoke ``qt4_wrap_ui()``.

* Test properties learned to support
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.
  This is useful to specify per-configuration values for test
  properties like :prop_test:`REQUIRED_FILES` and
  :prop_test:`WORKING_DIRECTORY`.

* A new :prop_test:`SKIP_RETURN_CODE` test property was introduced
  to tell :manual:`ctest(1)` to treat a particular test return code as
  if the test were not run.  This is useful for test drivers to report
  that certain test requirements were not available.

* New types of :ref:`Compatible Interface Properties` were introduced,
  namely the :prop_tgt:`COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX` and
  :prop_tgt:`COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN` for calculating numeric
  maximum and minimum values respectively.

Modules
-------

* The :module:`CheckTypeSize` module ``check_type_size`` macro and
  the :module:`CheckStructHasMember` module ``check_struct_has_member``
  macro learned a new ``LANGUAGE`` option to optionally check C++ types.

* The :module:`ExternalData` module learned to work with no
  URL templates if a local store is available.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` function ``ExternalProject_Add``
  learned a new ``GIT_SUBMODULES`` option to specify a subset
  of available submodules to checkout.

* A new :module:`FindBacktrace` module has been added to support
  :command:`find_package(Backtrace)` calls.

* A new :module:`FindLua` module has been added to support
  :command:`find_package(Lua)` calls.

* The :module:`FindBoost` module learned a new ``Boost_NAMESPACE``
  option to change the ``boost`` prefix on library names.

* The :module:`FindBoost` module learned to control search
  for libraries with the ``g`` tag (for MS debug runtime) with
  a new ``Boost_USE_DEBUG_RUNTIME`` option.  It is ``ON`` by
  default to preserve existing behavior.

* The :module:`FindJava` and :module:`FindJNI` modules learned
  to use a ``JAVA_HOME`` CMake variable or environment variable,
  and then try ``/usr/libexec/java_home`` on OS X.

* The :module:`UseJava` module ``add_jar`` function learned a new
  ``MANIFEST`` option to pass the ``-m`` option to ``jar``.

* A new :module:`CMakeFindDependencyMacro` module was introduced with
  a ``find_dependency`` macro to find transitive dependencies in
  a :manual:`package configuration file <cmake-packages(7)>`.  Such
  dependencies are omitted by the listing of the :module:`FeatureSummary`
  module.

* The :module:`FindQt4` module learned to create :ref:`Imported Targets`
  for Qt executables.  This helps disambiguate when using multiple
  :manual:`Qt versions <cmake-qt(7)>` in the same buildsystem.

* The :module:`FindRuby` module learned to search for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1.

Generator Expressions
---------------------

* New ``$<PLATFORM_ID>`` and ``$<PLATFORM_ID:...>``
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
  have been added.

* The ``$<CONFIG>``
  :manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` now has
  a variant which takes no argument.  This is equivalent to the
  ``$<CONFIGURATION>`` expression.

* New ``$<UPPER_CASE:...>`` and ``$<LOWER_CASE:...>``
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
  generator expressions have been added.

* A new ``$<MAKE_C_IDENTIFIER:...>``
  :manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` has
  been added.

Other
-----

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-E`` option learned a new ``sleep`` command.

* The :manual:`ccmake(1)` dialog learned to honor the
  :prop_cache:`STRINGS` cache entry property to cycle through
  the enumerated list of possible values.

* The :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` dialog learned to remember window
  settings between sessions.

* The :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` dialog learned to remember the type
  of a cache entry for completion in the ``Add Entry`` dialog.

New Diagnostics
===============

* Directories named in the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`
  target property of imported targets linked conditionally by a
  :manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
  were not checked for existence.  Now they are checked.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0027`.

* Build target names must now match a validity pattern and may no longer
  conflict with CMake-defined targets.  See policy :policy:`CMP0037`.

* Build targets that specify themselves as a link dependency were
  silently accepted but are now diagnosed.  See :policy:`CMP0038`.

* The :command:`target_link_libraries` command used to silently ignore
  calls specifying as their first argument build targets created by
  :command:`add_custom_target` but now diagnoses this mistake.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0039`.

* The :command:`add_custom_command` command used to silently ignore
  calls specifying the ``TARGET`` option with a non-existent target
  but now diagnoses this mistake.  See policy :policy:`CMP0040`.

* Relative paths in the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`
  target property used to be silently accepted if they contained a
  :manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
  but are now rejected.  See policy :policy:`CMP0041`.

* The :command:`get_target_property` command learned to reject calls
  specifying a non-existent target.  See policy :policy:`CMP0045`.

* The :command:`add_dependencies` command learned to reject calls
  specifying a dependency on a non-existent target.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0046`.

* Link dependency analysis learned to assume names containing ``::``
  refer to :ref:`Alias Targets` or :ref:`Imported Targets`.  It will
  now produce an error if such a linked target is missing.  Previously
  in this case CMake generated a link line that failed at build time.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0028`.

* When the :command:`project` or :command:`enable_language` commands
  initialize support for a language, it is now an error if the full
  path to the compiler cannot be found and stored in the corresponding
  :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER` variable.  This produces nicer error
  messages up front and stops processing when no working compiler
  is known to be available.

* Target sources specified with the :command:`add_library` or
  :command:`add_executable` command learned to reject items which
  require an undocumented extra layer of variable expansion.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0049`.

* Use of :command:`add_custom_command` undocumented ``SOURCE``
  signatures now results in an error.  See policy :policy:`CMP0050`.

Deprecated and Removed Features
===============================

* Compatibility options supporting code written for CMake versions
  prior to 2.4 have been removed.

* Several long-outdated commands that should no longer be called
  have been disallowed in new code by policies:

  - Policy :policy:`CMP0029` disallows :command:`subdir_depends`
  - Policy :policy:`CMP0030` disallows :command:`use_mangled_mesa`
  - Policy :policy:`CMP0031` disallows :command:`load_command`
  - Policy :policy:`CMP0032` disallows :command:`output_required_files`
  - Policy :policy:`CMP0033` disallows :command:`export_library_dependencies`
  - Policy :policy:`CMP0034` disallows :command:`utility_source`
  - Policy :policy:`CMP0035` disallows :command:`variable_requires`
  - Policy :policy:`CMP0036` disallows :command:`build_name`

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-i`` wizard mode has been removed.
  Instead use an interactive dialog such as :manual:`ccmake(1)`
  or use the ``-D`` option to set cache values from the command line.

* The builtin documentation formatters that supported command-line
  options such as ``--help-man`` and ``--help-html`` have been removed
  in favor of the above-mentioned new documentation system.  These and
  other command-line options that used to generate man- and html-
  formatted pages no longer work.  The :manual:`cmake(1)`
  ``--help-custom-modules`` option now produces a warning at runtime
  and generates a minimal document that reports the limitation.

* The :prop_dir:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>` directory properties and the
  :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>` target properties have been
  deprecated.  Instead set the corresponding :prop_dir:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`
  directory property or :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` target property and
  use :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` like
  ``$<CONFIG:...>`` to specify per-configuration definitions.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0043`.

* The :prop_tgt:`LOCATION` target property should no longer be read from
  non-IMPORTED targets.  It does not make sense in multi-configuration
  generators since the build configuration is not known while configuring
  the project.  It has been superseded by the ``$<TARGET_FILE>`` generator
  expression.  See policy :policy:`CMP0026`.

* The :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_FLAGS` target property is now documented
  as deprecated, though no warning is issued.  Use the
  :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_OPTIONS` target property or the
  :command:`target_compile_options` command instead.

* The :module:`GenerateExportHeader` module ``add_compiler_export_flags``
  function is now deprecated.  It has been superseded by the
  :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET` and
  :prop_tgt:`VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN` target properties.

Other Changes
=============

* The version scheme was changed to use only two components for
  the feature level instead of three.  The third component will
  now be used for bug-fix releases or the date of development versions.
  See the :variable:`CMAKE_VERSION` variable documentation for details.

* The default install locations of CMake itself on Windows and
  OS X no longer contain the CMake version number.  This allows
  for easy replacement without re-generating local build trees
  manually.

* Generators for Visual Studio 10 (2010) and later were renamed to
  include the product year like generators for older VS versions:

  - ``Visual Studio 10`` -> :generator:`Visual Studio 10 2010`
  - ``Visual Studio 11`` -> :generator:`Visual Studio 11 2012`
  - ``Visual Studio 12`` -> :generator:`Visual Studio 12 2013`

  This clarifies which generator goes with each Visual Studio
  version.  The old names are recognized for compatibility.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` value for Apple-provided
  Clang is now ``AppleClang``.  It must be distinct from upstream
  Clang because the version numbers differ.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0025`.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` value for ``qcc`` on QNX
  is now ``QCC``.  It must be distinct from ``GNU`` because the
  command-line options differ.  See policy :policy:`CMP0047`.

* On 64-bit OS X the :variable:`CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR` value
  is now correctly detected as ``x86_64`` instead of ``i386``.

* On OS X, CMake learned to enable behavior specified by the
  :prop_tgt:`MACOSX_RPATH` target property by default.  This activates
  use of ``@rpath`` for runtime shared library searches.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0042`.

* The :command:`build_command` command now returns a :manual:`cmake(1)`
  ``--build`` command line instead of a direct invocation of the native
  build tool.  When using ``Visual Studio`` generators, CMake and CTest
  no longer require :variable:`CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM` to be located up front.
  Selection of the proper msbuild or devenv tool is now performed as
  late as possible when the solution (``.sln``) file is available so
  it can depend on project content.

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` ``--build`` command now shares its own stdout
  and stderr pipes with the native build tool by default.
  The ``--use-stderr`` option that once activated this is now ignored.

* The ``$<C_COMPILER_ID:...>`` and ``$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:...>``
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
  used to perform case-insensitive comparison but have now been
  corrected to perform case-sensitive comparison.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0044`.

* The builtin ``edit_cache`` target will no longer select
  :manual:`ccmake(1)` by default when no interactive terminal will
  be available (e.g. with :generator:`Ninja` or an IDE generator).
  Instead :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` will be preferred if available.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` download step learned to
  re-attempt download in certain cases to be more robust to
  temporary network failure.

* The :module:`FeatureSummary` no longer lists transitive
  dependencies since they were not directly requested by the
  current project.

* The ``cmake-mode.el`` major Emacs editing mode has been cleaned
  up and enhanced in several ways.

* Include directories specified in the
  :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` of :ref:`Imported Targets`
  are treated as ``SYSTEM`` includes by default when handled as
  :ref:`usage requirements <Include Directories and Usage Requirements>`.
CMake 3.11 Release Notes
************************

  .. contents::

Changes made since CMake 3.10 include the following.

New Features
============

Platforms
---------

* TI C/C++ compilers are now supported by the :generator:`Ninja` generator.

Generators
----------

* The :generator:`CodeBlocks` extra generator learned to check a
  :variable:`CMAKE_CODEBLOCKS_COMPILER_ID` variable for a custom
  compiler identification value to place in the project file.

* The :ref:`Makefile Generators` and the :generator:`Ninja` generator learned
  to add compiler launcher tools along with the compiler for the ``Fortran``
  language (``C``, ``CXX``, and ``CUDA`` were supported previously).
  See the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` variable and
  :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` target property for details.

* :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` learned to support the ``COMPILE_LANGUAGE``
  :manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` in
  target-wide :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`,
  :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`, :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_OPTIONS`, and
  :command:`file(GENERATE)`.  See generator expression documentation
  for caveats.

* The :generator:`Xcode` generator learned to support the ``COMPILE_LANGUAGE``
  :manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` in
  target-wide :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` and
  :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`.  It previously supported only
  :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_OPTIONS` and :command:`file(GENERATE)`.
  See generator expression documentation for caveats.

Commands
--------

* :command:`add_library` and :command:`add_executable` commands can now be
  called without any sources and will not complain as long as sources are
  added later via the :command:`target_sources` command.

* The :command:`file(DOWNLOAD)` and :command:`file(UPLOAD)` commands
  gained ``NETRC`` and ``NETRC_FILE`` options to specify use of a
  ``.netrc`` file.

* The :command:`target_compile_definitions` command learned to set the
  :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` property on
  :ref:`Imported Targets`.

* The :command:`target_compile_features` command learned to set the
  :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_COMPILE_FEATURES` property on :ref:`Imported Targets`.

* The :command:`target_compile_options` command learned to set the
  :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS` property on :ref:`Imported Targets`.

* The :command:`target_include_directories` command learned to set the
  :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` property on
  :ref:`Imported Targets`.

* The :command:`target_sources` command learned to set the
  :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_SOURCES` property on :ref:`Imported Targets`.

* The :command:`target_link_libraries` command learned to set the
  :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` property on :ref:`Imported Targets`.

Variables
---------

* A :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE` variable was introduced
  to hold the selected instance of the generator's corresponding
  native tools if multiple are available.  This is used by the
  :generator:`Visual Studio 15 2017` generator to hold the
  selected instance of Visual Studio persistently.

* A :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS` variable was added
  to enable setting of default permissions for directories created implicitly
  during installation of files by :command:`install` and
  :command:`file(INSTALL)`, e.g. during ``make install``.

* A :variable:`CMAKE_JOB_POOLS` variable was added specify a value to use for
  the :prop_gbl:`JOB_POOLS` property. This enables control over build
  parallelism with command line configuration parameters when using the Ninja
  generator.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_NETRC` and :variable:`CMAKE_NETRC_FILE` variables
  were added to specify use of a ``.netrc`` file by the
  :command:`file(DOWNLOAD)` and :command:`file(UPLOAD)` commands and
  the :module:`ExternalProject` module.

* A :variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION` variable was added to
  initialize the :prop_tgt:`CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION` target property
  on targets when they are created.

Properties
----------

* The :prop_sf:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` source file property learned to support
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.

* A :prop_sf:`COMPILE_OPTIONS` source file property was added to manage list
  of options to pass to the compiler.

* An :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_GLOBAL` target property was added to indicate
  whether an :ref:`IMPORTED target <Imported Targets>` is globally visible.
  It is automatically set to a true value for targets created with the
  ``GLOBAL`` option to :command:`add_library` or :command:`add_executable`.
  Additionally, project code may now *promote* a local imported target
  to be globally visible by setting this property to ``TRUE``.

* An :prop_sf:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` source file property was added to specify
  list of preprocessor include file search directories.

* Source file properties :prop_sf:`VS_SHADER_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATIONS` and
  :prop_sf:`VS_SHADER_ENABLE_DEBUG` have been added to specify more
  details of ``.hlsl`` sources with :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`.

Modules
-------

* The :module:`CheckIncludeFiles` module :command:`CHECK_INCLUDE_FILES`
  command gained a ``LANGUAGE`` option to specify whether to check using the
  ``C`` or ``CXX`` compiler.

* The :module:`CMakePackageConfigHelpers` module
  :command:`write_basic_package_version_file` command learned a new
  ``SameMinorVersion`` mode for the ``COMPATIBILITY`` argument.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module learned to substitute ``<DOWNLOAD_DIR>``
  in comments, commands, working directory and byproducts.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module gained ``NETRC`` and ``NETRC_FILE``
  options to specify use of a ``.netrc`` file.

* A new :module:`FetchContent` module was added which supports populating
  content at configure time using any of the download/update methods
  supported by :command:`ExternalProject_Add`.  This allows the content
  to be used immediately during the configure stage, such as with
  :command:`add_subdirectory`, etc.  Hierarchical project structures are
  well supported, allowing parent projects to override the content details
  of child projects and ensuring content is not populated multiple times
  throughout the whole project tree.

* The :module:`FindBLAS` and :module:`FindLAPACK` modules learned to support
  `FLAME`_ ``blis`` and ``libflame``.

* The :module:`FindDoxygen` module :command:`doxygen_add_docs` function
  now supports a new ``DOXYGEN_VERBATIM_VARS`` list variable.  Any
  ``DOXYGEN_...`` variable contained in that list will bypass the automatic
  quoting logic, leaving its contents untouched when transferring them to the
  output ``Doxyfile``.

* A :module:`FindIconv` module was added to locate iconv support.

* The :module:`GenerateExportHeader` module ``GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER`` command
  gained an ``INCLUDE_GUARD_NAME`` option to change the name of the include
  guard symbol written to the generated export header.
  Additionally, it now adds a comment after the closing ``#endif`` on the
  generated export header's include guard.

* The :module:`UseJava` module ``add_jar`` command gained a
  ``GENERATE_NATIVE_HEADERS`` option to generate native header files
  using ``javac -h`` for ``javac`` 1.8 or above.  This supersedes
  ``create_javah``, which no longer works with JDK 1.10 and above due
  to removal of the ``javah`` tool by `JEP 313`_.

.. _`JEP 313`: http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/313

Autogen
-------

* When using :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` or :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`, CMake now starts
  multiple parallel ``moc`` or ``uic`` processes to reduce the build time.
  A new :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOGEN_PARALLEL` variable and
  :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_PARALLEL` target property may be set to specify the
  number of parallel ``moc`` or ``uic`` processes to start.  The default
  is derived from the number of CPUs on the host.

CTest
-----

* The :command:`ctest_start` command no longer sets
  :variable:`CTEST_RUN_CURRENT_SCRIPT` due to issues with scoping if it is
  called from inside a function. Instead, it sets an internal variable in
  CTest. However, setting :variable:`CTEST_RUN_CURRENT_SCRIPT` to 0 at the
  global scope still prevents the script from being re-run at the end.

CPack
-----

* :manual:`cpack(1)` gained ``--trace`` and ``--trace-expand`` options.

* The :module:`CPackIFW` module gained new
  :variable:`CPACK_IFW_PACKAGE_REMOVE_TARGET_DIR` variable to control
  if the target directory should not be deleted when uninstalling.

* The :module:`CPackRPM` module learned to enable enforcing of execute
  privileges on programs and shared libraries.
  See :variable:`CPACK_RPM_INSTALL_WITH_EXEC` variable.

* A :variable:`CPACK_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS` variable was added
  which serves the same purpose during packaging (e.g. ``make package``) as the
  :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS` variable serves during
  installation (e.g. ``make install``).

Other
-----

* :ref:`Alias Targets` may now alias :ref:`Imported Targets` that are
  created with the ``GLOBAL`` option to :command:`add_library`.

* :ref:`Interface Libraries` may now have custom properties set on them if
  they start with either an underscore (``_``) or a lowercase ASCII character.
  The original intention was to only allow properties which made sense for
  ``INTERFACE`` libraries, but it also blocked usage of custom properties.

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` ``--open <dir>`` command-line option was added
  to open generated IDE projects like Visual Studio solutions or Xcode
  projects.

Deprecated and Removed Features
===============================

* An explicit deprecation diagnostic was added for policies ``CMP0037``
  through ``CMP0054`` (``CMP0036`` and below were already deprecated).
  The :manual:`cmake-policies(7)` manual explains that the OLD behaviors
  of all policies are deprecated and that projects should port to the
  NEW behaviors.

* The ``KDevelop3`` generator has been removed.

Other Changes
=============

* Policy :policy:`CMP0037` no longer reserves target names associated
  with optional features, such as ``test`` and ``package``, unless
  the corresponding feature is enabled.

* The :module:`FindOpenGL` module now prefers GLVND libraries if available.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0072`.

* The minimum deployment target set in the
  :variable:`CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` variable used to be only
  applied for macOS regardless of the selected SDK.  It is now properly
  set for the target platform selected by :variable:`CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT`.
  For example, if the sysroot variable specifies an iOS SDK then the
  value in ``CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`` is interpreted as minimum
  iOS version.

* The :generator:`Xcode` generator behavior of generating one project
  file per :command:`project()` command may now be controlled with the
  :variable:`CMAKE_XCODE_GENERATE_TOP_LEVEL_PROJECT_ONLY` variable.
  This could be useful to speed up the CMake generation step for
  large projects and to work-around a bug in the ``ZERO_CHECK`` logic.

* Since the ``CMakeCache.txt`` format does not support newlines in values,
  values containing newlines are now truncated before writing to the file.
  In addition, a warning comment is written to the cache file, and a warning
  message is displayed to the user on the console.

Updates
=======

Changes made since CMake 3.11.0 include the following.

3.11.1
------

* The :module:`CheckIncludeFile` module ``check_include_file`` macro,
  :module:`CheckIncludeFileCXX` module ``check_include_file_cxx`` macro,
  and :module:`CheckIncludeFiles` module ``check_include_files`` macro
  were taught to honor the ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES`` variable in
  CMake 3.11.0.  This has been reverted due to changing behavior of
  checks for existing projects.  It may be restored in the future
  with a policy for compatibility.

3.11.2
------

* Calling :command:`add_library` to create an alias of an imported
  target that is not globally visible now causes an error again as
  it did prior to 3.11.0.  This diagnostic was accidentally dropped
  from CMake 3.11.0 and 3.11.1 by the change to allow globally visible
  imported targets to be aliased.

* The :module:`FindQt4` module ``qt4_wrap_cpp``, ``qt4_wrap_ui`` and
  ``qt4_add_resources`` macros now set :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOMOC` and
  :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOUIC` on their generated files.  These files never
  need to be processed by moc or uic, and we must say so explicitly to
  account for policy :policy:`CMP0071`.

3.11.3
------

* CMake 3.11.0 introduced support for resolving symbolic links on
  Windows in code paths that typically do so on UNIX.  This has been
  reverted due to breakage on ``subst`` drives.
Visual Studio 8 2005
--------------------

Removed.  This once generated Visual Studio 8 2005 project files, but
the generator has been removed since CMake 3.12.  It is still possible to
build with VS 2005 tools using the :generator:`NMake Makefiles` generator.
Unix Makefiles
--------------

Generates standard UNIX makefiles.

A hierarchy of UNIX makefiles is generated into the build tree.  Any
standard UNIX-style make program can build the project through the
default make target.  A "make install" target is also provided.
Green Hills MULTI
-----------------

Generates Green Hills MULTI project files (experimental, work-in-progress).

Customizations are available through the following cache variables:

* ``GHS_BSP_NAME``
* ``GHS_CUSTOMIZATION``
* ``GHS_GPJ_MACROS``
* ``GHS_OS_DIR``

.. note::
  This generator is deemed experimental as of CMake |release|
  and is still a work in progress.  Future versions of CMake
  may make breaking changes as the generator matures.
Ninja
-----

Generates build.ninja files.

A build.ninja file is generated into the build tree.  Recent versions
of the ninja program can build the project through the "all" target.
An "install" target is also provided.

For each subdirectory ``sub/dir`` of the project, additional targets
are generated:

``sub/dir/all``
  Depends on all targets required by the subdirectory.

``sub/dir/install``
  Runs the install step in the subdirectory, if any.

``sub/dir/test``
  Runs the test step in the subdirectory, if any.

``sub/dir/package``
  Runs the package step in the subdirectory, if any.

Fortran Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``Ninja`` generator conditionally supports Fortran when the ``ninja``
tool has the required features.  As of this version of CMake the needed
features have not been integrated into upstream Ninja.  Kitware maintains
a branch of Ninja with the required features on `github.com/Kitware/ninja`_.

.. _`github.com/Kitware/ninja`: https://github.com/Kitware/ninja/tree/features-for-fortran#readme
Visual Studio 10 2010
---------------------

  Specify target platform ``x64``.

``Visual Studio 10 2010 IA64``
  Specify target platform ``Itanium``.

For compatibility with CMake versions prior to 3.0, one may specify this
generator using the name ``Visual Studio 10`` without the year component.

Toolset Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``v100`` toolset that comes with Visual Studio 10 2010 is selected by
default.  The :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET` option may be set, perhaps
via the :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-T`` option, to specify another toolset.
MinGW Makefiles

via the :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-T`` option, to specify another toolset.
Visual Studio 6
---------------

Removed.  This once generated Visual Studio 6 project files, but the
generator has been removed since CMake 3.6.  It is still possible to
build with VS 6 tools using the :generator:`NMake Makefiles` generator.
Visual Studio 7
---------------

Removed.  This once generated Visual Studio .NET 2002 project files, but
the generator has been removed since CMake 3.6.  It is still possible to

Visual Studio 15 2017
---------------------

Generates Visual Studio 15 (VS 2017) project files.

The :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM` variable may be set
to specify a target platform name (architecture).

For compatibility with CMake versions prior to 3.1, one may specify
a target platform name optionally at the end of this generator name:

``Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64``
  Specify target platform ``x64``.

``Visual Studio 15 2017 ARM``
  Specify target platform ``ARM``.

Instance Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

VS 2017 supports multiple installations on the same machine.
The :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE` variable may be set as a
cache entry containing the absolute path to a Visual Studio instance.
If the value is not specified explicitly by the user or a toolchain file,
CMake queries the Visual Studio Installer to locate VS instances, chooses
one, and sets the variable as a cache entry to hold the value persistently.

When CMake first chooses an instance, if the ``VS150COMNTOOLS`` environment
variable is set and points to the ``Common7/Tools`` directory within
one of the instances, that instance will be used.  Otherwise, if more
than one instance is installed we do not define which one is chosen
by default.

Toolset Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``v141`` toolset that comes with Visual Studio 15 2017 is selected by
default.  The :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET` option may be set, perhaps
via the :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-T`` option, to specify another toolset.

.. include:: VS_TOOLSET_HOST_ARCH.txt
NMake Makefiles JOM
-------------------

Generates JOM makefiles.
MACROS
------

List of macro commands available in the current directory.

This read-only property specifies the list of CMake macros currently
defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.  See the macro
command.
VARIABLES
---------

List of variables defined in the current directory.

This read-only property specifies the list of CMake variables
currently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.
INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
----------------------------

Enable interprocedural optimization for targets in a directory.

If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are
known to be supported by the compiler.
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>
----------------------------

Ignored.  See CMake Policy :policy:`CMP0043`.

Per-configuration preprocessor definitions in a directory.

This is the configuration-specific version of :prop_dir:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`
where ``<CONFIG>`` is an upper-case name (ex. ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG``).

This property will be initialized in each directory by its value in
the directory's parent.

Contents of ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
manual for available expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)`
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

Generator expressions should be preferred instead of setting this property.
VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_PRE_<section>
-------------------------------

Specify a preSolution global section in Visual Studio.

Setting a property like this generates an entry of the following form
in the solution file:

::

  GlobalSection(<section>) = preSolution
    <contents based on property value>
  EndGlobalSection

The property must be set to a semicolon-separated list of key=value
pairs.  Each such pair will be transformed into an entry in the
solution global section.  Whitespace around key and value is ignored.
List elements which do not contain an equal sign are skipped.

This property only works for Visual Studio 9 and above; it is ignored
on other generators.  The property only applies when set on a
directory whose CMakeLists.txt contains a project() command.
TESTS
-----

List of tests.

This read-only property holds a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of tests
defined so far by the :command:`add_test` command.
RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
----------------

Specify a launcher for link rules.

See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global property for a directory.
COMPILE_OPTIONS
---------------

List of options to pass to the compiler.

This property holds a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options
given so far to the :command:`add_compile_options` command.

This property is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_OPTIONS` target
property when a target is created, which is used by the generators to set
the options for the compiler.

Contents of ``COMPILE_OPTIONS`` may use "generator expressions" with the
syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual
for available expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)` manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.
INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>
-------------------------------------

Per-configuration interprocedural optimization for a directory.

This is a per-configuration version of INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION.
If set, this property overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.
BUILDSYSTEM_TARGETS
-------------------

This read-only directory property contains a
:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of buildsystem targets added in the
directory by calls to the :command:`add_library`, :command:`add_executable`,
and :command:`add_custom_target` commands.  The list does not include any
:ref:`Imported Targets` or :ref:`Alias Targets`, but does include
:ref:`Interface Libraries`.  Each entry in the list is the logical name
of a target, suitable to pass to the :command:`get_property` command
``TARGET`` option.
PARENT_DIRECTORY
----------------

Source directory that added current subdirectory.

This read-only property specifies the source directory that added the
current source directory as a subdirectory of the build.  In the
top-level directory the value is the empty-string.
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
-------------------

Preprocessor definitions for compiling a directory's sources.

This property specifies the list of options given so far to the
:command:`add_compile_definitions` (or :command:`add_definitions`) command.

The ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` property may be set to a semicolon-separated
list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax ``VAR`` or ``VAR=value``.
Function-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will
automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system
(note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some
values).

This property will be initialized in each directory by its value in the
directory's parent.

CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
by the native build tool.

.. include:: /include/COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DISCLAIMER.txt

Contents of ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
manual for available expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)`
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

The corresponding :prop_dir:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>` property may
be set to specify per-configuration definitions.  Generator expressions
should be preferred instead of setting the alternative property.
LISTFILE_STACK
--------------

The current stack of listfiles being processed.

This property is mainly useful when trying to debug errors in your
CMake scripts.  It returns a list of what list files are currently
being processed, in order.  So if one listfile does an
:command:`include` command then that is effectively pushing the
included listfile onto the stack.
IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM
----------------------------------

Specify #include line transforms for dependencies in a directory.

This property specifies rules to transform macro-like #include lines
during implicit dependency scanning of C and C++ source files.  The
list of rules must be semicolon-separated with each entry of the form
"A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%" (the % must be literal).  During dependency
scanning occurrences of A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be
replaced by the value given with the macro argument substituted for
'%'.  For example, the entry

::

  MYDIR(%)=<mydir/%>

will convert lines of the form

::

  #include MYDIR(myheader.h)

to

::

  #include <mydir/myheader.h>

allowing the dependency to be followed.

This property applies to sources in all targets within a directory.
The property value is initialized in each directory by its value in
the directory's parent.
CLEAN_NO_CUSTOM
---------------

Set to true to tell :ref:`Makefile Generators` not to remove the outputs of
custom commands for this directory during the ``make clean`` operation.
This is ignored on other generators because it is not possible to implement.
DEFINITIONS
-----------

For CMake 2.4 compatibility only.  Use :prop_dir:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`
instead.

This read-only property specifies the list of flags given so far to
the :command:`add_definitions` command.  It is intended for debugging
purposes.  Use the :prop_dir:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` directory property
instead.

This built-in read-only property does not exist if policy
:policy:`CMP0059` is set to ``NEW``.
VS_STARTUP_PROJECT
------------------

Specify the default startup project in a Visual Studio solution.

The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` create a ``.sln`` file for each directory
whose ``CMakeLists.txt`` file calls the :command:`project` command.  Set this
property in the same directory as a :command:`project` command call (e.g. in
the top-level ``CMakeLists.txt`` file) to specify the default startup project
for the correpsonding solution file.

The property must be set to the name of an existing target.  This
will cause that project to be listed first in the generated solution
file causing Visual Studio to make it the startup project if the
solution has never been opened before.

If this property is not specified, then the ``ALL_BUILD`` project
will be the default.
SUBDIRECTORIES
--------------

This read-only directory property contains a
:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of subdirectories processed so far by
the :command:`add_subdirectory` or :command:`subdirs` commands.  Each entry is
the absolute path to the source directory (containing the ``CMakeLists.txt``
file).  This is suitable to pass to the :command:`get_property` command
``DIRECTORY`` option.

.. note::

  The :command:`subdirs` command does not process its arguments until
  after the calling directory is fully processed.  Therefore looking
  up this property in the current directory will not see them.
CACHE_VARIABLES
---------------

List of cache variables available in the current directory.

This read-only property specifies the list of CMake cache variables
currently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.
RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
-------------------

Specify a launcher for compile rules.

See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global property for a directory.
TEST_INCLUDE_FILE
-----------------

Deprecated.  Use :prop_dir:`TEST_INCLUDE_FILES` instead.

A cmake file that will be included when ctest is run.

If you specify ``TEST_INCLUDE_FILE``, that file will be included and
processed when ctest is run on the directory.
SOURCE_DIR
----------

This read-only directory property reports absolute path to the source
directory on which it is read.
ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES
---------------------------

Additional files to clean during the make clean stage.

A list of files that will be cleaned as a part of the "make clean"
stage.
INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
--------------------------

Include file scanning regular expression.

This property specifies the regular expression used during
dependency scanning to match include files that should be followed.
See the :command:`include_regular_expression` command for a high-level
interface to set this property.
VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_<section>
--------------------------------

Specify a postSolution global section in Visual Studio.

Setting a property like this generates an entry of the following form
in the solution file:

::

  GlobalSection(<section>) = postSolution
    <contents based on property value>
  EndGlobalSection

The property must be set to a semicolon-separated list of key=value
pairs.  Each such pair will be transformed into an entry in the
solution global section.  Whitespace around key and value is ignored.
List elements which do not contain an equal sign are skipped.

This property only works for Visual Studio 9 and above; it is ignored
on other generators.  The property only applies when set on a
directory whose CMakeLists.txt contains a project() command.

Note that CMake generates postSolution sections ExtensibilityGlobals
and ExtensibilityAddIns by default.  If you set the corresponding
property, it will override the default section.  For example, setting
VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_ExtensibilityGlobals will override the default
contents of the ExtensibilityGlobals section, while keeping
ExtensibilityAddIns on its default.  However, CMake will always
add a ``SolutionGuid`` to the ``ExtensibilityGlobals`` section
if it is not specified explicitly.
RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
------------------

Specify a launcher for custom rules.

See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global property for a directory.
TEST_INCLUDE_FILES
------------------

A list of cmake files that will be included when ctest is run.

If you specify ``TEST_INCLUDE_FILES``, those files will be included and
processed when ctest is run on the directory.
BINARY_DIR
----------

This read-only directory property reports absolute path to the binary
directory corresponding to the source on which it is read.
EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
----------------

Exclude the directory from the all target of its parent.

A property on a directory that indicates if its targets are excluded
from the default build target.  If it is not, then with a Makefile for
example typing make will cause the targets to be built.  The same
concept applies to the default build of other generators.
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
-------------------

List of preprocessor include file search directories.

This property specifies the list of directories given so far to the
:command:`include_directories` command.

This property is used to populate the :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`
target property, which is used by the generators to set the include
directories for the compiler.

In addition to accepting values from that command, values may be set
directly on any directory using the :command:`set_property` command.  A
directory gets its initial value from its parent directory if it has one.
The initial value of the :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` target property
comes from the value of this property.  Both directory and target property
values are adjusted by calls to the :command:`include_directories` command.

The target property values are used by the generators to set the
include paths for the compiler.

Contents of ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
manual for available expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)`
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
LINK_DIRECTORIES
----------------

List of linker search directories.

This read-only property specifies the list of directories given so far
to the link_directories command.  It is intended for debugging
purposes.
LABELS
------

Specify a list of text labels associated with a directory and all of its
subdirectories. This is equivalent to setting the :prop_tgt:`LABELS` target
property and the :prop_test:`LABELS` test property on all targets and tests in
the current directory and subdirectories. Note: Launchers must enabled to
propagate labels to targets.

The :variable:`CMAKE_DIRECTORY_LABELS` variable can be used to initialize this
property.

The list is reported in dashboard submissions.
CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS
-----------------------

Tell CMake about additional input files to the configuration process.
If any named file is modified the build system will re-run CMake to
re-configure the file and generate the build system again.

Specify files as a semicolon-separated list of paths.  Relative paths
are interpreted as relative to the current source directory.
add_executable
--------------

Add an executable to the project using the specified source files.

::

  add_executable(<name> [WIN32] [MACOSX_BUNDLE]
                 [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
                 [source1] [source2 ...])

Adds an executable target called ``<name>`` to be built from the source
files listed in the command invocation.  (The source files can be omitted
here if they are added later using :command:`target_sources`.)  The
``<name>`` corresponds to the logical target name and must be globally
unique within a project.  The actual file name of the executable built is
constructed based on conventions of the native platform (such as
``<name>.exe`` or just ``<name>``).

By default the executable file will be created in the build tree
directory corresponding to the source tree directory in which the
command was invoked.  See documentation of the
:prop_tgt:`RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` target property to change this
location.  See documentation of the :prop_tgt:`OUTPUT_NAME` target property
to change the ``<name>`` part of the final file name.

If ``WIN32`` is given the property :prop_tgt:`WIN32_EXECUTABLE` will be
set on the target created.  See documentation of that target property for
details.

If ``MACOSX_BUNDLE`` is given the corresponding property will be set on
the created target.  See documentation of the :prop_tgt:`MACOSX_BUNDLE`
target property for details.

If ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` is given the corresponding property will be set on
the created target.  See documentation of the :prop_tgt:`EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`
target property for details.

Source arguments to ``add_executable`` may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
manual for available expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)`
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

See also :prop_sf:`HEADER_FILE_ONLY` on what to do if some sources are
pre-processed, and you want to have the original sources reachable from
within IDE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

  add_executable(<name> IMPORTED [GLOBAL])

An :ref:`IMPORTED executable target <Imported Targets>` references an
executable file located outside the project.  No rules are generated to
build it, and the :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` target property is ``True``.  The
target name has scope in the directory in which it is created and below, but
the ``GLOBAL`` option extends visibility.  It may be referenced like any
target built within the project.  ``IMPORTED`` executables are useful
for convenient reference from commands like :command:`add_custom_command`.
Details about the imported executable are specified by setting properties
whose names begin in ``IMPORTED_``.  The most important such property is
:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION` (and its per-configuration version
:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>`) which specifies the location of
the main executable file on disk.  See documentation of the ``IMPORTED_*``
properties for more information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

  add_executable(<name> ALIAS <target>)

Creates an :ref:`Alias Target <Alias Targets>`, such that ``<name>`` can
be used to refer to ``<target>`` in subsequent commands.  The ``<name>``
does not appear in the generated buildsystem as a make target.  The
``<target>`` may not be a non-``GLOBAL``
:ref:`Imported Target <Imported Targets>` or an ``ALIAS``.
``ALIAS`` targets can be used as targets to read properties
from, executables for custom commands and custom targets.  They can also be
tested for existence with the regular :command:`if(TARGET)` subcommand.
The ``<name>`` may not be used to modify properties of ``<target>``, that
is, it may not be used as the operand of :command:`set_property`,
:command:`set_target_properties`, :command:`target_link_libraries` etc.
An ``ALIAS`` target may not be installed or exported.
add_definitions
---------------

Adds -D define flags to the compilation of source files.

::

  add_definitions(-DFOO -DBAR ...)

Adds definitions to the compiler command line for targets in the current
directory and below (whether added before or after this command is invoked).
This command can be used to add any flags, but it is intended to add
preprocessor definitions.

.. note::

  This command has been superseded by alternatives:

  * Use :command:`add_compile_definitions` to add preprocessor definitions.
  * Use :command:`include_directories` to add include directories.
  * Use :command:`add_compile_options` to add other options.

Flags beginning in -D or /D that look like preprocessor definitions are
automatically added to the :prop_dir:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` directory
property for the current directory.  Definitions with non-trivial values
may be left in the set of flags instead of being converted for reasons of
backwards compatibility.  See documentation of the
:prop_dir:`directory <COMPILE_DEFINITIONS>`,
:prop_tgt:`target <COMPILE_DEFINITIONS>`,
:prop_sf:`source file <COMPILE_DEFINITIONS>` ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS``
properties for details on adding preprocessor definitions to specific
scopes and configurations.

See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)` manual for more on defining
buildsystem properties.
set_source_files_properties
---------------------------

Source files can have properties that affect how they are built.

::

  set_source_files_properties([file1 [file2 [...]]]
                              PROPERTIES prop1 value1
                              [prop2 value2 [...]])

Set properties associated with source files using a key/value paired
list.  See :ref:`Source File Properties` for the list of properties known
to CMake.  Source file properties are visible only to targets added
in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt).
export
------

Export targets from the build tree for use by outside projects.

::

  export(EXPORT <export-name> [NAMESPACE <namespace>] [FILE <filename>])

Create a file ``<filename>`` that may be included by outside projects to
import targets from the current project's build tree.  This is useful
during cross-compiling to build utility executables that can run on
the host platform in one project and then import them into another
project being compiled for the target platform.  If the ``NAMESPACE``
option is given the ``<namespace>`` string will be prepended to all target
names written to the file.

Target installations are associated with the export ``<export-name>``
using the ``EXPORT`` option of the :command:`install(TARGETS)` command.

The file created by this command is specific to the build tree and
should never be installed.  See the :command:`install(EXPORT)` command to
export targets from an installation tree.

The properties set on the generated IMPORTED targets will have the
same values as the final values of the input TARGETS.

::

  export(TARGETS [target1 [target2 [...]]] [NAMESPACE <namespace>]
         [APPEND] FILE <filename> [EXPORT_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES])

This signature is similar to the ``EXPORT`` signature, but targets are listed
explicitly rather than specified as an export-name.  If the APPEND option is
given the generated code will be appended to the file instead of overwriting it.
The EXPORT_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES keyword, if present, causes the
contents of the properties matching
``(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_<CONFIG>)?`` to be exported, when
policy CMP0022 is NEW.  If a library target is included in the export
but a target to which it links is not included the behavior is
unspecified.

.. note::

  :ref:`Object Libraries` under :generator:`Xcode` have special handling if
  multiple architectures are listed in :variable:`CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES`.
  In this case they will be exported as :ref:`Interface Libraries` with
  no object files available to clients.  This is sufficient to satisfy
  transitive usage requirements of other targets that link to the
  object libraries in their implementation.

::

  export(PACKAGE <name>)

Store the current build directory in the CMake user package registry
for package ``<name>``.  The find_package command may consider the
directory while searching for package ``<name>``.  This helps dependent
projects find and use a package from the current project's build tree
without help from the user.  Note that the entry in the package
registry that this command creates works only in conjunction with a
package configuration file (``<name>Config.cmake``) that works with the
build tree. In some cases, for example for packaging and for system
wide installations, it is not desirable to write the user package
registry. If the :variable:`CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY` variable
is enabled, the ``export(PACKAGE)`` command will do nothing.

::

  export(TARGETS [target1 [target2 [...]]]  [ANDROID_MK <filename>])

This signature exports cmake built targets to the android ndk build system
by creating an Android.mk file that references the prebuilt targets. The
Android NDK supports the use of prebuilt libraries, both static and shared.
This allows cmake to build the libraries of a project and make them available
to an ndk build system complete with transitive dependencies, include flags
and defines required to use the libraries. The signature takes a list of
targets and puts them in the Android.mk file specified by the ``<filename>``
given. This signature can only be used if policy CMP0022 is NEW for all
targets given. A error will be issued if that policy is set to OLD for one
of the targets.
qt_wrap_ui
----------

Create Qt user interfaces Wrappers.

::

  qt_wrap_ui(resultingLibraryName HeadersDestName
             SourcesDestName SourceLists ...)

Produce .h and .cxx files for all the .ui files listed in the
``SourceLists``.  The .h files will be added to the library using the
``HeadersDestNamesource`` list.  The .cxx files will be added to the
library using the ``SourcesDestNamesource`` list.
use_mangled_mesa
----------------

Disallowed.  See CMake Policy :policy:`CMP0030`.

Copy mesa headers for use in combination with system GL.

::

  use_mangled_mesa(PATH_TO_MESA OUTPUT_DIRECTORY)

The path to mesa includes, should contain gl_mangle.h.  The mesa
headers are copied to the specified output directory.  This allows
mangled mesa headers to override other GL headers by being added to
the include directory path earlier.
target_include_directories
--------------------------

Add include directories to a target.

::

  target_include_directories(<target> [SYSTEM] [BEFORE]
    <INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [items1...]
    [<INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [items2...] ...])

Specify include directories to use when compiling a given target.
The named ``<target>`` must have been created by a command such
as :command:`add_executable` or :command:`add_library` and must not be an
:ref:`ALIAS target <Alias Targets>`.

If ``BEFORE`` is specified, the content will be prepended to the property
instead of being appended.

The ``INTERFACE``, ``PUBLIC`` and ``PRIVATE`` keywords are required to specify
the scope of the following arguments.  ``PRIVATE`` and ``PUBLIC`` items will
populate the :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` property of ``<target>``.
``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` items will populate the
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` property of ``<target>``.
(:ref:`IMPORTED targets <Imported Targets>` only support ``INTERFACE`` items.)
The following arguments specify include directories.

Specified include directories may be absolute paths or relative paths.
Repeated calls for the same <target> append items in the order called.  If
``SYSTEM`` is specified, the compiler will be told the
directories are meant as system include directories on some platforms
(signalling this setting might achieve effects such as the compiler
skipping warnings, or these fixed-install system files not being
considered in dependency calculations - see compiler docs).  If ``SYSTEM``
is used together with ``PUBLIC`` or ``INTERFACE``, the
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` target property will be
populated with the specified directories.

Arguments to ``target_include_directories`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
manual for available expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)`
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

Include directories usage requirements commonly differ between the build-tree
and the install-tree.  The ``BUILD_INTERFACE`` and ``INSTALL_INTERFACE``
generator expressions can be used to describe separate usage requirements
based on the usage location.  Relative paths are allowed within the
``INSTALL_INTERFACE`` expression and are interpreted relative to the
installation prefix.  For example:

.. code-block:: cmake

  target_include_directories(mylib PUBLIC
    $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/mylib>
    $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/mylib>  # <prefix>/include/mylib
  )

Creating Relocatable Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. |INTERFACE_PROPERTY_LINK| replace:: :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`
.. include:: /include/INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_WARNING.txt
install_targets
---------------

Deprecated. Use the :command:`install(TARGETS)` command instead.

This command has been superceded by the :command:`install` command.  It is
provided for compatibility with older CMake code.

::

  install_targets(<dir> [RUNTIME_DIRECTORY dir] target target)

Create rules to install the listed targets into the given directory.
The directory ``<dir>`` is relative to the installation prefix, which is
stored in the variable :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.  If
``RUNTIME_DIRECTORY`` is specified, then on systems with special runtime
files (Windows DLL), the files will be copied to that directory.
get_property
------------

Get a property.

::

  get_property(<variable>
               <GLOBAL             |
                DIRECTORY [dir]    |
                TARGET    <target> |
                SOURCE    <source> |
                INSTALL   <file>   |
                TEST      <test>   |
                CACHE     <entry>  |
                VARIABLE>
               PROPERTY <name>
               [SET | DEFINED | BRIEF_DOCS | FULL_DOCS])

Get one property from one object in a scope.  The first argument
specifies the variable in which to store the result.  The second
argument determines the scope from which to get the property.  It must
be one of the following:

``GLOBAL``
  Scope is unique and does not accept a name.

``DIRECTORY``
  Scope defaults to the current directory but another
  directory (already processed by CMake) may be named by full or
  relative path.

``TARGET``
  Scope must name one existing target.

``SOURCE``
  Scope must name one source file.

``INSTALL``
  Scope must name one installed file path.

``TEST``
  Scope must name one existing test.

``CACHE``
  Scope must name one cache entry.

``VARIABLE``
  Scope is unique and does not accept a name.

The required ``PROPERTY`` option is immediately followed by the name of
the property to get.  If the property is not set an empty value is
returned, although some properties support inheriting from a parent scope
if defined to behave that way (see :command:`define_property`).

If the ``SET`` option is given the variable is set to a boolean
value indicating whether the property has been set.  If the ``DEFINED``
option is given the variable is set to a boolean value indicating
whether the property has been defined such as with the
:command:`define_property` command.
If ``BRIEF_DOCS`` or ``FULL_DOCS`` is given then the variable is set to a
string containing documentation for the requested property.  If
documentation is requested for a property that has not been defined
``NOTFOUND`` is returned.
include_directories
-------------------

Add include directories to the build.

::

  include_directories([AFTER|BEFORE] [SYSTEM] dir1 [dir2 ...])

Add the given directories to those the compiler uses to search for
include files.  Relative paths are interpreted as relative to the
current source directory.

The include directories are added to the :prop_dir:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`
directory property for the current ``CMakeLists`` file.  They are also
added to the :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` target property for each
target in the current ``CMakeLists`` file.  The target property values
are the ones used by the generators.

By default the directories specified are appended onto the current list of
directories.  This default behavior can be changed by setting
:variable:`CMAKE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_BEFORE` to ``ON``.  By using
``AFTER`` or ``BEFORE`` explicitly, you can select between appending and
prepending, independent of the default.

If the ``SYSTEM`` option is given, the compiler will be told the
directories are meant as system include directories on some platforms.
Signalling this setting might achieve effects such as the compiler
skipping warnings, or these fixed-install system files not being
considered in dependency calculations - see compiler docs.

Arguments to ``include_directories`` may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax "$<...>".  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
manual for available expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)`
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
get_source_file_property
------------------------

Get a property for a source file.

::

  get_source_file_property(VAR file property)

Get a property from a source file.  The value of the property is
stored in the variable ``VAR``.  If the source property is not found, the
behavior depends on whether it has been defined to be an ``INHERITED`` property
or not (see :command:`define_property`).  Non-inherited properties will set
``VAR`` to "NOTFOUND", whereas inherited properties will search the relevant
parent scope as described for the :command:`define_property` command and
if still unable to find the property, ``VAR`` will be set to an empty string.

Use :command:`set_source_files_properties` to set property values.  Source
file properties usually control how the file is built. One property that is
always there is :prop_sf:`LOCATION`.

See also the more general :command:`get_property` command.
create_test_sourcelist
----------------------

Create a test driver and source list for building test programs.

::

  create_test_sourcelist(sourceListName driverName
                         test1 test2 test3
                         EXTRA_INCLUDE include.h
                         FUNCTION function)

A test driver is a program that links together many small tests into a
single executable.  This is useful when building static executables
with large libraries to shrink the total required size.  The list of
source files needed to build the test driver will be in
``sourceListName``.  ``driverName`` is the name of the test driver program.
The rest of the arguments consist of a list of test source files, can
be semicolon separated.  Each test source file should have a function
in it that is the same name as the file with no extension (foo.cxx
should have int foo(int, char*[]);) ``driverName`` will be able to call
each of the tests by name on the command line.  If ``EXTRA_INCLUDE`` is
specified, then the next argument is included into the generated file.
If ``FUNCTION`` is specified, then the next argument is taken as a
function name that is passed a pointer to ac and av.  This can be used
to add extra command line processing to each test.  The
``CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_BEFORE_TESTMAIN`` cmake variable can be set to
have code that will be placed directly before calling the test main function.
``CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_AFTER_TESTMAIN`` can be set to have code that
will be placed directly after the call to the test main function.
ctest_start
-----------

Starts the testing for a given model

::

  ctest_start(<model> [<source> [<binary>]] [TRACK <track>] [QUIET])

  ctest_start([<model> [<source> [<binary>]]] [TRACK <track>] APPEND [QUIET])

Starts the testing for a given model.  The command should be called
after the binary directory is initialized.

The parameters are as follows:

``<model>``
  Set the dashboard model. Must be one of ``Experimental``, ``Continuous``, or
  ``Nightly``. This parameter is required unless ``APPEND`` is specified.

``<source>``
  Set the source directory. If not specified, the value of
  :variable:`CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY` is used instead.

``<binary>``
  Set the binary directory. If not specified, the value of
  :variable:`CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY` is used instead.

``TRACK <track>``
  If ``TRACK`` is used, the submissions will go to the specified track on the
  CDash server. If no ``TRACK`` is specified, the name of the model is used by
  default.

``APPEND``
  If ``APPEND`` is used, the existing ``TAG`` is used rather than creating a new
  one based on the current time stamp. If you use ``APPEND``, you can omit the
  ``<model>`` and ``TRACK <track>`` parameters, because they will be read from
  the generated ``TAG`` file. For example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    ctest_start(Experimental TRACK TrackExperimental)

  Later, in another ``ctest -S`` script:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    ctest_start(APPEND)

  When the second script runs ``ctest_start(APPEND)``, it will read the
  ``Experimental`` model and ``TrackExperimental`` track from the ``TAG`` file
  generated by the first ``ctest_start()`` command. Please note that if you
  call ``ctest_start(APPEND)`` and specify a different model or track than
  in the first ``ctest_start()`` command, a warning will be issued, and the
  new model and track will be used.

``QUIET``
  If ``QUIET`` is used, CTest will suppress any non-error messages that it
  otherwise would have printed to the console.

The parameters for ``ctest_start()`` can be issued in any order, with the
exception that ``<model>``, ``<source>``, and ``<binary>`` have to appear
in that order with respect to each other. The following are all valid and
equivalent:

.. code-block:: cmake

  ctest_start(Experimental path/to/source path/to/binary TRACK SomeTrack QUIET APPEND)

  ctest_start(TRACK SomeTrack Experimental QUIET path/to/source APPEND path/to/binary)

  ctest_start(APPEND QUIET Experimental path/to/source TRACK SomeTrack path/to/binary)

However, for the sake of readability, it is recommended that you order your
parameters in the order listed at the top of this page.

If the :variable:`CTEST_CHECKOUT_COMMAND` variable (or the
:variable:`CTEST_CVS_CHECKOUT` variable) is set, its content is treated as
command-line.  The command is invoked with the current working directory set
to the parent of the source directory, even if the source directory already
exists.  This can be used to create the source tree from a version control
repository.
add_dependencies
----------------

Add a dependency between top-level targets.

::

  add_dependencies(<target> [<target-dependency>]...)

Make a top-level ``<target>`` depend on other top-level targets to
ensure that they build before ``<target>`` does.  A top-level target
is one created by one of the :command:`add_executable`,
:command:`add_library`, or :command:`add_custom_target` commands
(but not targets generated by CMake like ``install``).

Dependencies added to an :ref:`imported target <Imported Targets>`
or an :ref:`interface library <Interface Libraries>` are followed
transitively in its place since the target itself does not build.

See the ``DEPENDS`` option of :command:`add_custom_target` and
:command:`add_custom_command` commands for adding file-level
dependencies in custom rules.  See the :prop_sf:`OBJECT_DEPENDS`
source file property to add file-level dependencies to object files.
ctest_run_script
----------------

runs a ctest -S script

::

  ctest_run_script([NEW_PROCESS] script_file_name script_file_name1
              script_file_name2 ... [RETURN_VALUE var])

Runs a script or scripts much like if it was run from ctest -S.  If no
argument is provided then the current script is run using the current
settings of the variables.  If ``NEW_PROCESS`` is specified then each
script will be run in a separate process.If ``RETURN_VALUE`` is specified
the return value of the last script run will be put into ``var``.
include
-------

Load and run CMake code from a file or module.

::

  include(<file|module> [OPTIONAL] [RESULT_VARIABLE <VAR>]
                        [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])

Load and run CMake code from the file given.  Variable reads and
writes access the scope of the caller (dynamic scoping).  If ``OPTIONAL``
is present, then no error is raised if the file does not exist.  If
``RESULT_VARIABLE`` is given the variable will be set to the full filename
which has been included or NOTFOUND if it failed.

If a module is specified instead of a file, the file with name
``<modulename>.cmake`` is searched first in :variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`,
then in the CMake module directory.  There is one exception to this: if
the file which calls ``include()`` is located itself in the CMake builtin
module directory, then first the CMake builtin module directory is searched and
:variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` afterwards.  See also policy :policy:`CMP0017`.

See the :command:`cmake_policy` command documentation for discussion of the
``NO_POLICY_SCOPE`` option.
ctest_coverage
--------------

Perform the :ref:`CTest Coverage Step` as a :ref:`Dashboard Client`.

::

  ctest_coverage([BUILD <build-dir>] [APPEND]
                 [LABELS <label>...]
                 [RETURN_VALUE <result-var>]
                 [CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var]
                 [QUIET]
                 )

Collect coverage tool results and stores them in ``Coverage.xml``
for submission with the :command:`ctest_submit` command.

The options are:

``BUILD <build-dir>``
  Specify the top-level build directory.  If not given, the
  :variable:`CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY` variable is used.

``APPEND``
  Mark ``Coverage.xml`` for append to results previously submitted to a
  dashboard server since the last :command:`ctest_start` call.
  Append semantics are defined by the dashboard server in use.
  This does *not* cause results to be appended to a ``.xml`` file
  produced by a previous call to this command.

``LABELS``
  Filter the coverage report to include only source files labeled
  with at least one of the labels specified.

``RETURN_VALUE <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable ``0`` if coverage tools
  ran without error and non-zero otherwise.

``CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable -1 if there are any errors running
  the command and prevent ctest from returning non-zero if an error occurs.

``QUIET``
  Suppress any CTest-specific non-error output that would have been
  printed to the console otherwise.  The summary indicating how many
  lines of code were covered is unaffected by this option.
add_custom_target
-----------------

Add a target with no output so it will always be built.

::

  add_custom_target(Name [ALL] [command1 [args1...]]
                    [COMMAND command2 [args2...] ...]
                    [DEPENDS depend depend depend ... ]
                    [BYPRODUCTS [files...]]
                    [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                    [COMMENT comment]
                    [VERBATIM] [USES_TERMINAL]
                    [COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS]
                    [SOURCES src1 [src2...]])

Adds a target with the given name that executes the given commands.
The target has no output file and is *always considered out of date*
even if the commands try to create a file with the name of the target.
Use the :command:`add_custom_command` command to generate a file with
dependencies.  By default nothing depends on the custom target.  Use
the :command:`add_dependencies` command to add dependencies to or
from other targets.

The options are:

``ALL``
  Indicate that this target should be added to the default build
  target so that it will be run every time (the command cannot be
  called ``ALL``).

``BYPRODUCTS``
  Specify the files the command is expected to produce but whose
  modification time may or may not be updated on subsequent builds.
  If a byproduct name is a relative path it will be interpreted
  relative to the build tree directory corresponding to the
  current source directory.
  Each byproduct file will be marked with the :prop_sf:`GENERATED`
  source file property automatically.

  Explicit specification of byproducts is supported by the
  :generator:`Ninja` generator to tell the ``ninja`` build tool
  how to regenerate byproducts when they are missing.  It is
  also useful when other build rules (e.g. custom commands)
  depend on the byproducts.  Ninja requires a build rule for any
  generated file on which another rule depends even if there are
  order-only dependencies to ensure the byproducts will be
  available before their dependents build.

  The ``BYPRODUCTS`` option is ignored on non-Ninja generators
  except to mark byproducts ``GENERATED``.

``COMMAND``
  Specify the command-line(s) to execute at build time.
  If more than one ``COMMAND`` is specified they will be executed in order,
  but *not* necessarily composed into a stateful shell or batch script.
  (To run a full script, use the :command:`configure_file` command or the
  :command:`file(GENERATE)` command to create it, and then specify
  a ``COMMAND`` to launch it.)

  If ``COMMAND`` specifies an executable target name (created by the
  :command:`add_executable` command) it will automatically be replaced
  by the location of the executable created at build time. If set, the
  :prop_tgt:`CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR` executable target property will
  also be prepended to the command to allow the executable to run on
  the host.
  Additionally a target-level dependency will be added so that the
  executable target will be built before this custom target.

  Arguments to ``COMMAND`` may use
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.
  References to target names in generator expressions imply target-level
  dependencies.

  The command and arguments are optional and if not specified an empty
  target will be created.

``COMMENT``
  Display the given message before the commands are executed at
  build time.

``DEPENDS``
  Reference files and outputs of custom commands created with
  :command:`add_custom_command` command calls in the same directory
  (``CMakeLists.txt`` file).  They will be brought up to date when
  the target is built.

  Use the :command:`add_dependencies` command to add dependencies
  on other targets.

``COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS``
  Lists in ``COMMAND`` arguments will be expanded, including those
  created with
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`,
  allowing ``COMMAND`` arguments such as
  ``${CC} "-I$<JOIN:$<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>,;-I>" foo.cc``
  to be properly expanded.

``SOURCES``
  Specify additional source files to be included in the custom target.
  Specified source files will be added to IDE project files for
  convenience in editing even if they have no build rules.

``VERBATIM``
  All arguments to the commands will be escaped properly for the
  build tool so that the invoked command receives each argument
  unchanged.  Note that one level of escapes is still used by the
  CMake language processor before ``add_custom_target`` even sees
  the arguments.  Use of ``VERBATIM`` is recommended as it enables
  correct behavior.  When ``VERBATIM`` is not given the behavior
  is platform specific because there is no protection of
  tool-specific special characters.

``USES_TERMINAL``
  The command will be given direct access to the terminal if possible.
  With the :generator:`Ninja` generator, this places the command in
  the ``console`` :prop_gbl:`pool <JOB_POOLS>`.

``WORKING_DIRECTORY``
  Execute the command with the given current working directory.
  If it is a relative path it will be interpreted relative to the
  build tree directory corresponding to the current source directory.
remove_definitions
------------------

Removes -D define flags added by :command:`add_definitions`.

::

  remove_definitions(-DFOO -DBAR ...)

Removes flags (added by :command:`add_definitions`) from the compiler
command line for sources in the current directory and below.
define_property
---------------

Define and document custom properties.

::

  define_property(<GLOBAL | DIRECTORY | TARGET | SOURCE |
                   TEST | VARIABLE | CACHED_VARIABLE>
                   PROPERTY <name> [INHERITED]
                   BRIEF_DOCS <brief-doc> [docs...]
                   FULL_DOCS <full-doc> [docs...])

Define one property in a scope for use with the :command:`set_property` and
:command:`get_property` commands.  This is primarily useful to associate
documentation with property names that may be retrieved with the
:command:`get_property` command. The first argument determines the kind of
scope in which the property should be used.  It must be one of the
following:

::

  GLOBAL    = associated with the global namespace
  DIRECTORY = associated with one directory
  TARGET    = associated with one target
  SOURCE    = associated with one source file
  TEST      = associated with a test named with add_test
  VARIABLE  = documents a CMake language variable
  CACHED_VARIABLE = documents a CMake cache variable

Note that unlike :command:`set_property` and :command:`get_property` no
actual scope needs to be given; only the kind of scope is important.

The required ``PROPERTY`` option is immediately followed by the name of
the property being defined.

If the ``INHERITED`` option is given, then the :command:`get_property` command
will chain up to the next higher scope when the requested property is not set
in the scope given to the command.

* ``DIRECTORY`` scope chains to its parent directory's scope, continuing the
  walk up parent directories until a directory has the property set or there
  are no more parents.  If still not found at the top level directory, it
  chains to the ``GLOBAL`` scope.
* ``TARGET``, ``SOURCE`` and ``TEST`` properties chain to ``DIRECTORY`` scope,
  including further chaining up the directories, etc. as needed.

Note that this scope chaining behavior only applies to calls to
:command:`get_property`, :command:`get_directory_property`,
:command:`get_target_property`, :command:`get_source_file_property` and
:command:`get_test_property`.  There is no inheriting behavior when *setting*
properties, so using ``APPEND`` or ``APPEND_STRING`` with the
:command:`set_property` command will not consider inherited values when working
out the contents to append to.

The ``BRIEF_DOCS`` and ``FULL_DOCS`` options are followed by strings to be
associated with the property as its brief and full documentation.
Corresponding options to the :command:`get_property` command will retrieve
the documentation.
build_command
-------------

Get a command line to build the current project.
This is mainly intended for internal use by the :module:`CTest` module.

.. code-block:: cmake

  build_command(<variable>
                [CONFIGURATION <config>]
                [TARGET <target>]
                [PROJECT_NAME <projname>] # legacy, causes warning
               )

Sets the given ``<variable>`` to a command-line string of the form::

 <cmake> --build . [--config <config>] [--target <target>] [-- -i]

where ``<cmake>`` is the location of the :manual:`cmake(1)` command-line
tool, and ``<config>`` and ``<target>`` are the values provided to the
``CONFIGURATION`` and ``TARGET`` options, if any.  The trailing ``-- -i``
option is added for :ref:`Makefile Generators` if policy :policy:`CMP0061`
is not set to ``NEW``.

When invoked, this ``cmake --build`` command line will launch the
underlying build system tool.

.. code-block:: cmake

  build_command(<cachevariable> <makecommand>)

This second signature is deprecated, but still available for backwards
compatibility.  Use the first signature instead.

It sets the given ``<cachevariable>`` to a command-line string as
above but without the ``--target`` option.
The ``<makecommand>`` is ignored but should be the full path to
devenv, nmake, make or one of the end user build tools
for legacy invocations.

.. note::
 In CMake versions prior to 3.0 this command returned a command
 line that directly invokes the native build tool for the current
 generator.  Their implementation of the ``PROJECT_NAME`` option
 had no useful effects, so CMake now warns on use of the option.
exec_program
------------

Deprecated.  Use the :command:`execute_process` command instead.

Run an executable program during the processing of the CMakeList.txt
file.

::

  exec_program(Executable [directory in which to run]
               [ARGS <arguments to executable>]
               [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>]
               [RETURN_VALUE <var>])

The executable is run in the optionally specified directory.  The
executable can include arguments if it is double quoted, but it is
better to use the optional ``ARGS`` argument to specify arguments to the
program.  This is because cmake will then be able to escape spaces in
the executable path.  An optional argument ``OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` specifies a
variable in which to store the output.  To capture the return value of
the execution, provide a ``RETURN_VALUE``.  If ``OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` is
specified, then no output will go to the stdout/stderr of the console
running cmake.
configure_file
--------------

Copy a file to another location and modify its contents.

::

  configure_file(<input> <output>
                 [COPYONLY] [ESCAPE_QUOTES] [@ONLY]
                 [NEWLINE_STYLE [UNIX|DOS|WIN32|LF|CRLF] ])

Copies an ``<input>`` file to an ``<output>`` file and substitutes
variable values referenced as ``@VAR@`` or ``${VAR}`` in the input
file content.  Each variable reference will be replaced with the
current value of the variable, or the empty string if the variable
is not defined.  Furthermore, input lines of the form::

  #cmakedefine VAR ...

will be replaced with either::

  #define VAR ...

or::

  /* #undef VAR */

depending on whether ``VAR`` is set in CMake to any value not considered
a false constant by the :command:`if` command.  The "..." content on the
line after the variable name, if any, is processed as above.
Input file lines of the form ``#cmakedefine01 VAR`` will be replaced with
either ``#define VAR 1`` or ``#define VAR 0`` similarly.
The result lines (with the exception of the ``#undef`` comments) can be
indented using spaces and/or tabs between the ``#`` character
and the ``cmakedefine`` or ``cmakedefine01`` words. This whitespace
indentation will be preserved in the output lines::

  #  cmakedefine VAR
  #  cmakedefine01 VAR

will be replaced, if ``VAR`` is defined, with::

  #  define VAR
  #  define VAR 1

If the input file is modified the build system will re-run CMake to
re-configure the file and generate the build system again.
The generated file is modified and its timestamp updated on subsequent
cmake runs only if its content is changed.

The arguments are:

``<input>``
  Path to the input file.  A relative path is treated with respect to
  the value of :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`.  The input path
  must be a file, not a directory.

``<output>``
  Path to the output file or directory.  A relative path is treated
  with respect to the value of :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`.
  If the path names an existing directory the output file is placed
  in that directory with the same file name as the input file.

``COPYONLY``
  Copy the file without replacing any variable references or other
  content.  This option may not be used with ``NEWLINE_STYLE``.

``ESCAPE_QUOTES``
  Escape any substituted quotes with backslashes (C-style).

``@ONLY``
  Restrict variable replacement to references of the form ``@VAR@``.
  This is useful for configuring scripts that use ``${VAR}`` syntax.

``NEWLINE_STYLE <style>``
  Specify the newline style for the output file.  Specify
  ``UNIX`` or ``LF`` for ``\n`` newlines, or specify
  ``DOS``, ``WIN32``, or ``CRLF`` for ``\r\n`` newlines.
  This option may not be used with ``COPYONLY``.

Example
^^^^^^^

Consider a source tree containing a ``foo.h.in`` file:

.. code-block:: c

  #cmakedefine FOO_ENABLE
  #cmakedefine FOO_STRING "@FOO_STRING@"

An adjacent ``CMakeLists.txt`` may use ``configure_file`` to
configure the header:

.. code-block:: cmake

  option(FOO_ENABLE "Enable Foo" ON)
  if(FOO_ENABLE)
    set(FOO_STRING "foo")
  endif()
  configure_file(foo.h.in foo.h @ONLY)

This creates a ``foo.h`` in the build directory corresponding to
this source directory.  If the ``FOO_ENABLE`` option is on, the
configured file will contain:

.. code-block:: c

  #define FOO_ENABLE
  #define FOO_STRING "foo"

Otherwise it will contain:

.. code-block:: c

  /* #undef FOO_ENABLE */
  /* #undef FOO_STRING */

One may then use the :command:`include_directories` command to
specify the output directory as an include directory:

.. code-block:: cmake

  include_directories(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR})

so that sources may include the header as ``#include <foo.h>``.
unset
-----

Unset a variable, cache variable, or environment variable.

::

  unset(<variable> [CACHE | PARENT_SCOPE])

Removes the specified variable causing it to become undefined.  If
``CACHE`` is present then the variable is removed from the cache instead
of the current scope.

If ``PARENT_SCOPE`` is present then the variable is removed from the scope
above the current scope.  See the same option in the :command:`set` command
for further details.

``<variable>`` can be an environment variable such as:

::

  unset(ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH})

in which case the variable will be removed from the current
environment.
link_directories
----------------

Specify directories in which the linker will look for libraries.

::

  link_directories(directory1 directory2 ...)

Specify the paths in which the linker should search for libraries.
The command will apply only to targets created after it is called.
Relative paths given to this command are interpreted as relative to
the current source directory, see :policy:`CMP0015`.

Note that this command is rarely necessary.  Library locations
returned by :command:`find_package` and :command:`find_library` are
absolute paths. Pass these absolute library file paths directly to the
:command:`target_link_libraries` command.  CMake will ensure the linker finds
them.
return
------

Return from a file, directory or function.

::

  return()

Returns from a file, directory or function.  When this command is
encountered in an included file (via :command:`include` or
:command:`find_package`), it causes processing of the current file to stop
and control is returned to the including file.  If it is encountered in a
file which is not included by another file, e.g.  a ``CMakeLists.txt``,
control is returned to the parent directory if there is one.  If return is
called in a function, control is returned to the caller of the function.
Note that a macro is not a function and does not handle return like a
function does.
target_compile_options
----------------------

Add compile options to a target.

::

  target_compile_options(<target> [BEFORE]
    <INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [items1...]
    [<INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [items2...] ...])

Specify compile options to use when compiling a given target.  The
named ``<target>`` must have been created by a command such as
:command:`add_executable` or :command:`add_library` and must not be an
:ref:`ALIAS target <Alias Targets>`.

If ``BEFORE`` is specified, the content will be prepended to the property
instead of being appended.

This command can be used to add any options, but
alternative commands exist to add preprocessor definitions
(:command:`target_compile_definitions` and :command:`add_compile_definitions`)
or include directories (:command:`target_include_directories` and
:command:`include_directories`).  See documentation of the
:prop_dir:`directory <COMPILE_OPTIONS>` and
:prop_tgt:`target <COMPILE_OPTIONS>` ``COMPILE_OPTIONS`` properties.

The ``INTERFACE``, ``PUBLIC`` and ``PRIVATE`` keywords are required to
specify the scope of the following arguments.  ``PRIVATE`` and ``PUBLIC``
items will populate the :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_OPTIONS` property of
``<target>``.  ``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` items will populate the
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS` property of ``<target>``.
(:ref:`IMPORTED targets <Imported Targets>` only support ``INTERFACE`` items.)
The following arguments specify compile options.  Repeated calls for the same
``<target>`` append items in the order called.

Arguments to ``target_compile_options`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``. See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
manual for available expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)`
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

.. include:: COMPILE_OPTIONS_SHELL.txt
endif
-----

Ends a list of commands in an if block.

::

  endif(expression)

See the :command:`if` command.
endmacro
--------

Ends a list of commands in a macro block.

::

  endmacro(expression)

See the :command:`macro` command.
add_test
--------

Add a test to the project to be run by :manual:`ctest(1)`.

::

  add_test(NAME <name> COMMAND <command> [<arg>...]
           [CONFIGURATIONS <config>...]
           [WORKING_DIRECTORY <dir>])

Add a test called ``<name>``.  The test name may not contain spaces,
quotes, or other characters special in CMake syntax.  The options are:

``COMMAND``
  Specify the test command-line.  If ``<command>`` specifies an
  executable target (created by :command:`add_executable`) it will
  automatically be replaced by the location of the executable created
  at build time.

``CONFIGURATIONS``
  Restrict execution of the test only to the named configurations.

``WORKING_DIRECTORY``
  Set the :prop_test:`WORKING_DIRECTORY` test property to
  specify the working directory in which to execute the test.
  If not specified the test will be run with the current working
  directory set to the build directory corresponding to the
  current source directory.

The given test command is expected to exit with code ``0`` to pass and
non-zero to fail, or vice-versa if the :prop_test:`WILL_FAIL` test
property is set.  Any output written to stdout or stderr will be
captured by :manual:`ctest(1)` but does not affect the pass/fail status
unless the :prop_test:`PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION` or
:prop_test:`FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION` test property is used.

The ``COMMAND`` and ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` options may use "generator
expressions" with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the
:manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual for available expressions.

Example usage::

  add_test(NAME mytest
           COMMAND testDriver --config $<CONFIGURATION>
                              --exe $<TARGET_FILE:myexe>)

This creates a test ``mytest`` whose command runs a ``testDriver`` tool
passing the configuration name and the full path to the executable
file produced by target ``myexe``.

.. note::

  CMake will generate tests only if the :command:`enable_testing`
  command has been invoked.  The :module:`CTest` module invokes the
  command automatically when the ``BUILD_TESTING`` option is ``ON``.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

::

  add_test(<name> <command> [<arg>...])

Add a test called ``<name>`` with the given command-line.  Unlike
the above ``NAME`` signature no transformation is performed on the
command-line to support target names or generator expressions.
break
-----

Break from an enclosing foreach or while loop.

::

  break()

Breaks from an enclosing foreach loop or while loop

See also the :command:`continue` command.
ctest_sleep
-----------

sleeps for some amount of time

::

  ctest_sleep(<seconds>)

Sleep for given number of seconds.

::

  ctest_sleep(<time1> <duration> <time2>)

Sleep for t=(time1 + duration - time2) seconds if t > 0.
elseif
------

Starts the elseif portion of an if block.

::

  elseif(expression)

See the :command:`if` command.
get_cmake_property
------------------

Get a global property of the CMake instance.

::

  get_cmake_property(VAR property)

Get a global property from the CMake instance.  The value of the property is
stored in the variable ``VAR``.  If the property is not found, ``VAR``
will be  set to "NOTFOUND".  See the :manual:`cmake-properties(7)` manual
for available properties.

See also the :command:`get_property` command ``GLOBAL`` option.

In addition to global properties, this command (for historical reasons)
also supports the :prop_dir:`VARIABLES` and :prop_dir:`MACROS` directory
properties.  It also supports a special ``COMPONENTS`` global property that
lists the components given to the :command:`install` command.
macro
-----

Start recording a macro for later invocation as a command::

  macro(<name> [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
    COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
    COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
    ...
  endmacro(<name>)

Define a macro named ``<name>`` that takes arguments named ``arg1``,
``arg2``, ``arg3``, (...).
Commands listed after macro, but before the matching
:command:`endmacro()`, are not invoked until the macro is invoked.
When it is invoked, the commands recorded in the macro are first
modified by replacing formal parameters (``${arg1}``) with the arguments
passed, and then invoked as normal commands.
In addition to referencing the formal parameters you can reference the
values ``${ARGC}`` which will be set to the number of arguments passed
into the function as well as ``${ARGV0}``, ``${ARGV1}``, ``${ARGV2}``,
...  which will have the actual values of the arguments passed in.
This facilitates creating macros with optional arguments.
Additionally ``${ARGV}`` holds the list of all arguments given to the
macro and ``${ARGN}`` holds the list of arguments past the last expected
argument.
Referencing to ``${ARGV#}`` arguments beyond ``${ARGC}`` have undefined
behavior. Checking that ``${ARGC}`` is greater than ``#`` is the only
way to ensure that ``${ARGV#}`` was passed to the function as an extra
argument.

See the :command:`cmake_policy()` command documentation for the behavior
of policies inside macros.

Macro Argument Caveats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note that the parameters to a macro and values such as ``ARGN`` are
not variables in the usual CMake sense.  They are string
replacements much like the C preprocessor would do with a macro.
Therefore you will NOT be able to use commands like::

 if(ARGV1) # ARGV1 is not a variable
 if(DEFINED ARGV2) # ARGV2 is not a variable
 if(ARGC GREATER 2) # ARGC is not a variable
 foreach(loop_var IN LISTS ARGN) # ARGN is not a variable

In the first case, you can use ``if(${ARGV1})``.
In the second and third case, the proper way to check if an optional
variable was passed to the macro is to use ``if(${ARGC} GREATER 2)``.
In the last case, you can use ``foreach(loop_var ${ARGN})`` but this
will skip empty arguments.
If you need to include them, you can use::

 set(list_var "${ARGN}")
 foreach(loop_var IN LISTS list_var)

Note that if you have a variable with the same name in the scope from
which the macro is called, using unreferenced names will use the
existing variable instead of the arguments. For example::

 macro(_BAR)
   foreach(arg IN LISTS ARGN)
     [...]
   endforeach()
 endmacro()

 function(_FOO)
   _bar(x y z)
 endfunction()

 _foo(a b c)

Will loop over ``a;b;c`` and not over ``x;y;z`` as one might be expecting.
If you want true CMake variables and/or better CMake scope control you
should look at the function command.
install_programs
----------------

Deprecated. Use the :command:`install(PROGRAMS)` command instead.

This command has been superceded by the :command:`install` command.  It is
provided for compatibility with older CMake code.  The ``FILES`` form is
directly replaced by the ``PROGRAMS`` form of the :command:`install`
command.  The regexp form can be expressed more clearly using the ``GLOB``
form of the :command:`file` command.

::

  install_programs(<dir> file1 file2 [file3 ...])
  install_programs(<dir> FILES file1 [file2 ...])

Create rules to install the listed programs into the given directory.
Use the ``FILES`` argument to guarantee that the file list version of the
command will be used even when there is only one argument.

::

  install_programs(<dir> regexp)

In the second form any program in the current source directory that
matches the regular expression will be installed.

This command is intended to install programs that are not built by
cmake, such as shell scripts.  See the ``TARGETS`` form of the
:command:`install` command to create installation rules for targets built
by cmake.

The directory ``<dir>`` is relative to the installation prefix, which is
stored in the variable :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.
ctest_update
------------

Perform the :ref:`CTest Update Step` as a :ref:`Dashboard Client`.

::

  ctest_update([SOURCE <source-dir>] [RETURN_VALUE <result-var>] [QUIET])

Update the source tree from version control and record results in
``Update.xml`` for submission with the :command:`ctest_submit` command.

The options are:

``SOURCE <source-dir>``
  Specify the source directory.  If not given, the
  :variable:`CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY` variable is used.

``RETURN_VALUE <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable the number of files
  updated or ``-1`` on error.

``QUIET``
  Tell CTest to suppress most non-error messages that it would
  have otherwise printed to the console.  CTest will still report
  the new revision of the repository and any conflicting files
  that were found.

The update always follows the version control branch currently checked
out in the source directory.  See the :ref:`CTest Update Step`
documentation for more information.
link_libraries
--------------

Link libraries to all targets added later.

::

  link_libraries([item1 [item2 [...]]]
                 [[debug|optimized|general] <item>] ...)

Specify libraries or flags to use when linking any targets created later in
the current directory or below by commands such as :command:`add_executable`
or :command:`add_library`.  See the :command:`target_link_libraries` command
for meaning of arguments.

.. note::
  The :command:`target_link_libraries` command should be preferred whenever
  possible.  Library dependencies are chained automatically, so directory-wide
  specification of link libraries is rarely needed.
ctest_configure
---------------

Perform the :ref:`CTest Configure Step` as a :ref:`Dashboard Client`.

::

  ctest_configure([BUILD <build-dir>] [SOURCE <source-dir>] [APPEND]
                  [OPTIONS <options>] [RETURN_VALUE <result-var>] [QUIET]
                  [CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>])

Configure the project build tree and record results in ``Configure.xml``
for submission with the :command:`ctest_submit` command.

The options are:

``BUILD <build-dir>``
  Specify the top-level build directory.  If not given, the
  :variable:`CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY` variable is used.

``SOURCE <source-dir>``
  Specify the source directory.  If not given, the
  :variable:`CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY` variable is used.

``APPEND``
  Mark ``Configure.xml`` for append to results previously submitted to a
  dashboard server since the last :command:`ctest_start` call.
  Append semantics are defined by the dashboard server in use.
  This does *not* cause results to be appended to a ``.xml`` file
  produced by a previous call to this command.

``OPTIONS <options>``
  Specify command-line arguments to pass to the configuration tool.

``RETURN_VALUE <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable the return value of the native
  configuration tool.

``CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable -1 if there are any errors running
  the command and prevent ctest from returning non-zero if an error occurs.

``QUIET``
  Suppress any CTest-specific non-error messages that would have
  otherwise been printed to the console.  Output from the underlying
  configure command is not affected.
endfunction
-----------

Ends a list of commands in a function block.

::

  endfunction(expression)

See the :command:`function` command.
option
------

Provides an option that the user can optionally select.

::

  option(<option_variable> "help string describing option"
         [initial value])

Provide an option for the user to select as ``ON`` or ``OFF``.  If no
initial value is provided, ``OFF`` is used.

If you have options that depend on the values of other options, see
the module help for :module:`CMakeDependentOption`.
execute_process
---------------

Execute one or more child processes.

.. code-block:: cmake

  execute_process(COMMAND <cmd1> [args1...]]
                  [COMMAND <cmd2> [args2...] [...]]
                  [WORKING_DIRECTORY <directory>]
                  [TIMEOUT <seconds>]
                  [RESULT_VARIABLE <variable>]
                  [RESULTS_VARIABLE <variable>]
                  [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <variable>]
                  [ERROR_VARIABLE <variable>]
                  [INPUT_FILE <file>]
                  [OUTPUT_FILE <file>]
                  [ERROR_FILE <file>]
                  [OUTPUT_QUIET]
                  [ERROR_QUIET]
                  [OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE]
                  [ERROR_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE]
                  [ENCODING <name>])

Runs the given sequence of one or more commands in parallel with the standard
output of each process piped to the standard input of the next.
A single standard error pipe is used for all processes.

Options:

``COMMAND``
 A child process command line.

 CMake executes the child process using operating system APIs directly.
 All arguments are passed VERBATIM to the child process.
 No intermediate shell is used, so shell operators such as ``>``
 are treated as normal arguments.
 (Use the ``INPUT_*``, ``OUTPUT_*``, and ``ERROR_*`` options to
 redirect stdin, stdout, and stderr.)

 If a sequential execution of multiple commands is required, use multiple
 :command:`execute_process` calls with a single ``COMMAND`` argument.

``WORKING_DIRECTORY``
 The named directory will be set as the current working directory of
 the child processes.

``TIMEOUT``
 The child processes will be terminated if they do not finish in the
 specified number of seconds (fractions are allowed).

``RESULT_VARIABLE``
 The variable will be set to contain the result of last child process.
 This will be an integer return code from the last child or a string
 describing an error condition.

``RESULTS_VARIABLE <variable>``
 The variable will be set to contain the result of all processes as a
 :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>`, in order of the given ``COMMAND``
 arguments.  Each entry will be an integer return code from the
 corresponding child or a string describing an error condition.

``OUTPUT_VARIABLE``, ``ERROR_VARIABLE``
 The variable named will be set with the contents of the standard output
 and standard error pipes, respectively.  If the same variable is named
 for both pipes their output will be merged in the order produced.

``INPUT_FILE, OUTPUT_FILE``, ``ERROR_FILE``
 The file named will be attached to the standard input of the first
 process, standard output of the last process, or standard error of
 all processes, respectively.  If the same file is named for both
 output and error then it will be used for both.

``OUTPUT_QUIET``, ``ERROR_QUIET``
 The standard output or standard error results will be quietly ignored.

``ENCODING <name>``
 On Windows, the encoding that is used to decode output from the process.
 Ignored on other platforms.
 Valid encoding names are:

 ``NONE``
   Perform no decoding.  This assumes that the process output is encoded
   in the same way as CMake's internal encoding (UTF-8).
   This is the default.
 ``AUTO``
   Use the current active console's codepage or if that isn't
   available then use ANSI.
 ``ANSI``
   Use the ANSI codepage.
 ``OEM``
   Use the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) code page.
 ``UTF8`` or ``UTF-8``
   Use the UTF-8 codepage. Prior to CMake 3.11.0, only ``UTF8`` was accepted
   for this encoding. In CMake 3.11.0, ``UTF-8`` was added for consistency with
   the `UTF-8 RFC <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3629>`_ naming convention.

If more than one ``OUTPUT_*`` or ``ERROR_*`` option is given for the
same pipe the precedence is not specified.
If no ``OUTPUT_*`` or ``ERROR_*`` options are given the output will
be shared with the corresponding pipes of the CMake process itself.

The :command:`execute_process` command is a newer more powerful version of
:command:`exec_program`, but the old command has been kept for compatibility.
Both commands run while CMake is processing the project prior to build
system generation.  Use :command:`add_custom_target` and
:command:`add_custom_command` to create custom commands that run at
build time.

.. include:: FIND_XXX.txt

When searching for frameworks, if the file is specified as ``A/b.h``, then
the framework search will look for ``A.framework/Headers/b.h``.  If that
is found the path will be set to the path to the framework.  CMake
will convert this to the correct ``-F`` option to include the file.
include_external_msproject
--------------------------

Include an external Microsoft project file in a workspace.

::

  include_external_msproject(projectname location
                             [TYPE projectTypeGUID]
                             [GUID projectGUID]
                             [PLATFORM platformName]
                             dep1 dep2 ...)

Includes an external Microsoft project in the generated workspace
file.  Currently does nothing on UNIX.  This will create a target
named [projectname].  This can be used in the :command:`add_dependencies`
command to make things depend on the external project.

``TYPE``, ``GUID`` and ``PLATFORM`` are optional parameters that allow one to
specify the type of project, id (GUID) of the project and the name of
the target platform.  This is useful for projects requiring values
other than the default (e.g.  WIX projects).

If the imported project has different configuration names than the
current project, set the :prop_tgt:`MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>`
target property to specify the mapping.

    list(`TRANSFORM`_ <list> <ACTION> [...])

  `Ordering`_
    list(`REVERSE`_ <list>)
    list(`SORT`_ <list>)

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The list subcommands ``APPEND``, ``INSERT``, ``FILTER``, ``REMOVE_AT``,
``REMOVE_ITEM``, ``REMOVE_DUPLICATES``, ``REVERSE`` and ``SORT`` may create
new values for the list within the current CMake variable scope.  Similar to
the :command:`set` command, the LIST command creates new variable values in
the current scope, even if the list itself is actually defined in a parent
scope.  To propagate the results of these operations upwards, use
:command:`set` with ``PARENT_SCOPE``, :command:`set` with
``CACHE INTERNAL``, or some other means of value propagation.

.. note::

  A list in cmake is a ``;`` separated group of strings.  To create a
  list the set command can be used.  For example, ``set(var a b c d e)``
  creates a list with ``a;b;c;d;e``, and ``set(var "a b c d e")`` creates a
  string or a list with one item in it.   (Note macro arguments are not
  variables, and therefore cannot be used in LIST commands.)

.. note::

  When specifying index values, if ``<element index>`` is 0 or greater, it
  is indexed from the beginning of the list, with 0 representing the
  first list element.  If ``<element index>`` is -1 or lesser, it is indexed
  from the end of the list, with -1 representing the last list element.
  Be careful when counting with negative indices: they do not start from
  0.  -0 is equivalent to 0, the first list element.

Reading
^^^^^^^

.. _LENGTH:

::

  list(LENGTH <list> <output variable>)

Returns the list's length.

.. _GET:

::

  list(GET <list> <element index> [<element index> ...] <output variable>)

Returns the list of elements specified by indices from the list.

.. _JOIN:

::

  list(JOIN <list> <glue> <output variable>)

Returns a string joining all list's elements using the glue string.
To join multiple strings, which are not part of a list, use ``JOIN`` operator
from :command:`string` command.

.. _SUBLIST:

::

  list(SUBLIST <list> <begin> <length> <output variable>)

Returns a sublist of the given list.
If ``<length>`` is 0, an empty list will be returned.
If ``<length>`` is -1 or the list is smaller than ``<begin>+<length>`` then
the remaining elements of the list starting at ``<begin>`` will be returned.

Search
^^^^^^

.. _FIND:

::

  list(FIND <list> <value> <output variable>)

Returns the index of the element specified in the list or -1
if it wasn't found.

Modification
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _APPEND:

::

  list(APPEND <list> [<element> ...])

Appends elements to the list.

.. _FILTER:

::

  list(FILTER <list> <INCLUDE|EXCLUDE> REGEX <regular_expression>)

Includes or removes items from the list that match the mode's pattern.
In ``REGEX`` mode, items will be matched against the given regular expression.

For more information on regular expressions see also the
:command:`string` command.

.. _INSERT:

::

  list(INSERT <list> <element_index> <element> [<element> ...])

Inserts elements to the list to the specified location.

.. _REMOVE_ITEM:

::

  list(REMOVE_ITEM <list> <value> [<value> ...])

Removes the given items from the list.

.. _REMOVE_AT:

::

  list(REMOVE_AT <list> <index> [<index> ...])

Removes items at given indices from the list.

.. _REMOVE_DUPLICATES:

::

  list(REMOVE_DUPLICATES <list>)

Removes duplicated items in the list.

.. _TRANSFORM:

::

  list(TRANSFORM <list> <ACTION> [<SELECTOR>]
                        [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <output variable>])

Transforms the list by applying an action to all or, by specifying a
``<SELECTOR>``, to the selected elements of the list, storing result in-place
or in the specified output variable.

.. note::

   ``TRANSFORM`` sub-command does not change the number of elements of the
   list. If a ``<SELECTOR>`` is specified, only some elements will be changed,
   the other ones will remain same as before the transformation.

``<ACTION>`` specify the action to apply to the elements of list.
The actions have exactly the same semantics as sub-commands of
:command:`string` command.

The ``<ACTION>`` may be one of:

``APPEND``, ``PREPEND``: Append, prepend specified value to each element of
the list. ::

  list(TRANSFORM <list> <APPEND|PREPEND> <value> ...)

``TOUPPER``, ``TOLOWER``: Convert each element of the list to upper, lower
characters. ::

  list(TRANSFORM <list> <TOLOWER|TOUPPER> ...)

``STRIP``: Remove leading and trailing spaces from each element of the
list. ::

  list(TRANSFORM <list> STRIP ...)

``GENEX_STRIP``: Strip any
:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` from each
element of the list. ::

  list(TRANSFORM <list> GENEX_STRIP ...)

``REPLACE``: Match the regular expression as many times as possible and
substitute the replacement expression for the match for each element
of the list
(Same semantic as ``REGEX REPLACE`` from :command:`string` command). ::

  list(TRANSFORM <list> REPLACE <regular_expression>
                                <replace_expression> ...)

``<SELECTOR>`` select which elements of the list will be transformed. Only one
type of selector can be specified at a time.

The ``<SELECTOR>`` may be one of:

``AT``: Specify a list of indexes. ::

  list(TRANSFORM <list> <ACTION> AT <index> [<index> ...] ...)

``FOR``: Specify a range with, optionally, an increment used to iterate over
the range. ::

  list(TRANSFORM <list> <ACTION> FOR <start> <stop> [<step>] ...)

``REGEX``: Specify a regular expression. Only elements matching the regular
expression will be transformed. ::

  list(TRANSFORM <list> <ACTION> REGEX <regular_expression> ...)


Ordering
^^^^^^^^

.. _REVERSE:

::

  list(REVERSE <list>)

Reverses the contents of the list in-place.

.. _SORT:

::

  list(SORT <list>)


Sorts the list in-place alphabetically.
separate_arguments
------------------

Parse space-separated arguments into a semicolon-separated list.

::

  separate_arguments(<var> <NATIVE|UNIX|WINDOWS>_COMMAND "<args>")

Parses a UNIX- or Windows-style command-line string "<args>" and
stores a semicolon-separated list of the arguments in ``<var>``.  The
entire command line must be given in one "<args>" argument.

The ``UNIX_COMMAND`` mode separates arguments by unquoted whitespace.  It
recognizes both single-quote and double-quote pairs.  A backslash
escapes the next literal character (``\"`` is ``"``); there are no special
escapes (``\n`` is just ``n``).

The ``WINDOWS_COMMAND`` mode parses a Windows command-line using the same
syntax the runtime library uses to construct argv at startup.  It
separates arguments by whitespace that is not double-quoted.
Backslashes are literal unless they precede double-quotes.  See the
MSDN article `Parsing C Command-Line Arguments`_ for details.

The ``NATIVE_COMMAND`` mode parses a Windows command-line if the host
system is Windows, and a UNIX command-line otherwise.

.. _`Parsing C Command-Line Arguments`: https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/a1y7w461.aspx

::

  separate_arguments(<var>)

Convert the value of ``<var>`` to a semi-colon separated list.  All
spaces are replaced with ';'.  This helps with generating command
lines.
ctest_upload
------------

Upload files to a dashboard server as a :ref:`Dashboard Client`.

::

  ctest_upload(FILES <file>... [QUIET] [CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>])

The options are:

``FILES <file>...``
  Specify a list of files to be sent along with the build results to the
  dashboard server.

``QUIET``
  Suppress any CTest-specific non-error output that would have been
  printed to the console otherwise.

``CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable -1 if there are any errors running
  the command and prevent ctest from returning non-zero if an error occurs.
project
-------

Sets project details such as name, version, etc. and enables languages.

.. code-block:: cmake

 project(<PROJECT-NAME> [LANGUAGES] [<language-name>...])
 project(<PROJECT-NAME>
         [VERSION <major>[.<minor>[.<patch>[.<tweak>]]]]
         [DESCRIPTION <project-description-string>]
         [HOMEPAGE_URL <url-string>]
         [LANGUAGES <language-name>...])

Sets the name of the project and stores the name in the
:variable:`PROJECT_NAME` variable.  Additionally this sets variables

* :variable:`PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR`,
  :variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_SOURCE_DIR`
* :variable:`PROJECT_BINARY_DIR`,
  :variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_BINARY_DIR`

If ``VERSION`` is specified, given components must be non-negative integers.
If ``VERSION`` is not specified, the default version is the empty string.
The ``VERSION`` option may not be used unless policy :policy:`CMP0048` is
set to ``NEW``.

The :command:`project()` command stores the version number and its components
in variables

* :variable:`PROJECT_VERSION`,
  :variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION`
* :variable:`PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR`,
  :variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_MAJOR`
* :variable:`PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR`,
  :variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_MINOR`
* :variable:`PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH`,
  :variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_PATCH`
* :variable:`PROJECT_VERSION_TWEAK`,
  :variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_TWEAK`

Variables corresponding to unspecified versions are set to the empty string
(if policy :policy:`CMP0048` is set to ``NEW``).

If the optional ``DESCRIPTION`` is given, then :variable:`PROJECT_DESCRIPTION`
and :variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_DESCRIPTION` will be set to its argument.
The description is expected to be a relatively short string, usually no more
than a few words.

The optional ``HOMEPAGE_URL`` sets the analogous variables
:variable:`PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL` and :variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_HOMEPAGE_URL`.
When this option is given, the URL provided should be the canonical home for
the project.

Note that the description and homepage URL may be used as defaults for
things like packaging meta-data, documentation, etc.

Optionally you can specify which languages your project supports.
Example languages include ``C``, ``CXX`` (i.e.  C++), ``CUDA``,
``Fortran``, and ``ASM``.
By default ``C`` and ``CXX`` are enabled if no language options are
given.  Specify language ``NONE``, or use the ``LANGUAGES`` keyword
and list no languages, to skip enabling any languages.

If enabling ``ASM``, list it last so that CMake can check whether
compilers for other languages like ``C`` work for assembly too.

If a variable exists called :variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_<PROJECT-NAME>_INCLUDE`,
the file pointed to by that variable will be included as the last step of the
project command.

The top-level ``CMakeLists.txt`` file for a project must contain a
literal, direct call to the :command:`project` command; loading one
through the :command:`include` command is not sufficient.  If no such
call exists CMake will implicitly add one to the top that enables the
default languages (``C`` and ``CXX``).  The name of the project set in
the top level ``CMakeLists.txt`` file is available from the
:variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME` variable, its description from
:variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION`, its homepage URL from
:variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL` and its version from
:variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION`.

.. note::
  Call the :command:`cmake_minimum_required` command at the beginning
  of the top-level ``CMakeLists.txt`` file even before calling the
  ``project()`` command.  It is important to establish version and
  policy settings before invoking other commands whose behavior they
  may affect.  See also policy :policy:`CMP0000`.
ctest_build
-----------

Perform the :ref:`CTest Build Step` as a :ref:`Dashboard Client`.

::

  ctest_build([BUILD <build-dir>] [APPEND]
              [CONFIGURATION <config>]
              [FLAGS <flags>]
              [PROJECT_NAME <project-name>]
              [TARGET <target-name>]
              [NUMBER_ERRORS <num-err-var>]
              [NUMBER_WARNINGS <num-warn-var>]
              [RETURN_VALUE <result-var>]
              [CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>]
              )

Build the project and store results in ``Build.xml``
for submission with the :command:`ctest_submit` command.

The :variable:`CTEST_BUILD_COMMAND` variable may be set to explicitly
specify the build command line.  Otherwise the build command line is
computed automatically based on the options given.

The options are:

``BUILD <build-dir>``
  Specify the top-level build directory.  If not given, the
  :variable:`CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY` variable is used.

``APPEND``
  Mark ``Build.xml`` for append to results previously submitted to a
  dashboard server since the last :command:`ctest_start` call.
  Append semantics are defined by the dashboard server in use.
  This does *not* cause results to be appended to a ``.xml`` file
  produced by a previous call to this command.

``CONFIGURATION <config>``
  Specify the build configuration (e.g. ``Debug``).  If not
  specified the ``CTEST_BUILD_CONFIGURATION`` variable will be checked.
  Otherwise the ``-C <cfg>`` option given to the :manual:`ctest(1)`
  command will be used, if any.

``FLAGS <flags>``
  Pass additional arguments to the underlying build command.
  If not specified the ``CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS`` variable will be checked.
  This can, e.g., be used to trigger a parallel build using the
  ``-j`` option of make. See the :module:`ProcessorCount` module
  for an example.

``PROJECT_NAME <project-name>``
  Set the name of the project to build.  This should correspond
  to the top-level call to the :command:`project` command.
  If not specified the ``CTEST_PROJECT_NAME`` variable will be checked.

``TARGET <target-name>``
  Specify the name of a target to build.  If not specified the
  ``CTEST_BUILD_TARGET`` variable will be checked.  Otherwise the
  default target will be built.  This is the "all" target
  (called ``ALL_BUILD`` in :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`).

``NUMBER_ERRORS <num-err-var>``
  Store the number of build errors detected in the given variable.

``NUMBER_WARNINGS <num-warn-var>``
  Store the number of build warnings detected in the given variable.

``RETURN_VALUE <result-var>``
  Store the return value of the native build tool in the given variable.

``CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable -1 if there are any errors running
  the command and prevent ctest from returning non-zero if an error occurs.

``QUIET``
  Suppress any CTest-specific non-error output that would have been
  printed to the console otherwise.  The summary of warnings / errors,
  as well as the output from the native build tool is unaffected by
  this option.
ctest_read_custom_files
-----------------------

read CTestCustom files.

::

  ctest_read_custom_files( directory ... )

Read all the CTestCustom.ctest or CTestCustom.cmake files from the
given directory.

By default, invoking :manual:`ctest(1)` without a script will read custom
files from the binary directory.
set_tests_properties
--------------------

Set a property of the tests.

::

  set_tests_properties(test1 [test2...] PROPERTIES prop1 value1 prop2 value2)

Set a property for the tests.  If the test is not found, CMake
will report an error.
:manual:`Generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` will be
expanded the same as supported by the test's :command:`add_test` call.  See
:ref:`Test Properties` for the list of properties known to CMake.
include_guard
-------------

Provides an include guard for the file currently being processed by CMake.

::

  include_guard([DIRECTORY|GLOBAL])

Sets up an include guard for the current CMake file (see the
:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE` variable documentation).

CMake will end its processing of the current file at the location of the
:command:`include_guard` command if the current file has already been
processed for the applicable scope (see below). This provides functionality
similar to the include guards commonly used in source headers or to the
``#pragma once`` directive. If the current file has been processed previously
for the applicable scope, the effect is as though :command:`return` had been
called. Do not call this command from inside a function being defined within
the current file.

An optional argument specifying the scope of the guard may be provided.
Possible values for the option are:

``DIRECTORY``
  The include guard applies within the current directory and below. The file
  will only be included once within this directory scope, but may be included
  again by other files outside of this directory (i.e. a parent directory or
  another directory not pulled in by :command:`add_subdirectory` or
  :command:`include` from the current file or its children).

``GLOBAL``
  The include guard applies globally to the whole build. The current file
  will only be included once regardless of the scope.

If no arguments given, ``include_guard`` has the same scope as a variable,
meaning that the include guard effect is isolated by the most recent
function scope or current directory if no inner function scopes exist.
In this case the command behavior is the same as:

.. code-block:: cmake

  if(__CURRENT_FILE_VAR__)
    return()
  endif()
  set(__CURRENT_FILE_VAR__ TRUE)
fltk_wrap_ui
------------

Create FLTK user interfaces Wrappers.

::

  fltk_wrap_ui(resultingLibraryName source1
               source2 ... sourceN )

Produce .h and .cxx files for all the .fl and .fld files listed.  The
resulting .h and .cxx files will be added to a variable named
``resultingLibraryName_FLTK_UI_SRCS`` which should be added to your
library.
variable_requires
-----------------

Disallowed.  See CMake Policy :policy:`CMP0035`.

Use the :command:`if` command instead.

Assert satisfaction of an option's required variables.

::

  variable_requires(TEST_VARIABLE RESULT_VARIABLE
                    REQUIRED_VARIABLE1
                    REQUIRED_VARIABLE2 ...)

The first argument (``TEST_VARIABLE``) is the name of the variable to be
tested, if that variable is false nothing else is done.  If
``TEST_VARIABLE`` is true, then the next argument (``RESULT_VARIABLE``)
is a variable that is set to true if all the required variables are set.
The rest of the arguments are variables that must be true or not set
to NOTFOUND to avoid an error.  If any are not true, an error is
reported.
set_target_properties
---------------------

Targets can have properties that affect how they are built.

::

  set_target_properties(target1 target2 ...
                        PROPERTIES prop1 value1
                        prop2 value2 ...)

Set properties on targets.  The syntax for the command is to list all
the targets you want to change, and then provide the values you want to
set next.  You can use any prop value pair you want and extract it
later with the :command:`get_property` or :command:`get_target_property`
command.

See also the :command:`set_property(TARGET)` command.

See :ref:`Target Properties` for the list of properties known to CMake.
get_target_property
-------------------

Get a property from a target.

::

  get_target_property(VAR target property)

Get a property from a target.  The value of the property is stored in
the variable ``VAR``.  If the target property is not found, the behavior
depends on whether it has been defined to be an ``INHERITED`` property
or not (see :command:`define_property`).  Non-inherited properties will
set ``VAR`` to "NOTFOUND", whereas inherited properties will search the
relevant parent scope as described for the :command:`define_property`
command and if still unable to find the property, ``VAR`` will be set to
an empty string.

Use :command:`set_target_properties` to set target property values.
Properties are usually used to control how a target is built, but some
query the target instead.  This command can get properties for any
target so far created.  The targets do not need to be in the current
``CMakeLists.txt`` file.

See also the more general :command:`get_property` command.
find_library
------------

.. |FIND_XXX| replace:: find_library
.. |NAMES| replace:: NAMES name1 [name2 ...] [NAMES_PER_DIR]
.. |SEARCH_XXX| replace:: library
.. |SEARCH_XXX_DESC| replace:: library
.. |prefix_XXX_SUBDIR| replace:: ``<prefix>/lib``
.. |entry_XXX_SUBDIR| replace:: ``<entry>/lib``

.. |FIND_PACKAGE_ROOT_PREFIX_PATH_XXX| replace::
   ``<prefix>/lib/<arch>`` if :variable:`CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE` is set,
   and |FIND_PACKAGE_ROOT_PREFIX_PATH_XXX_SUBDIR|
.. |CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH_XXX| replace::
   ``<prefix>/lib/<arch>`` if :variable:`CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE` is set,
   and |CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH_XXX_SUBDIR|
.. |CMAKE_XXX_PATH| replace:: :variable:`CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH`
.. |CMAKE_XXX_MAC_PATH| replace:: :variable:`CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH`

.. |SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH_XXX| replace:: Directories in ``LIB``.
   On Windows hosts:
   ``<prefix>/lib/<arch>`` if :variable:`CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE` is set,
   and |SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PREFIX_PATH_XXX_SUBDIR|,
   and the directories in ``PATH`` itself.

.. |CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH_XXX| replace::
   ``<prefix>/lib/<arch>`` if :variable:`CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE` is set,
   and |CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH_XXX_SUBDIR|
.. |CMAKE_SYSTEM_XXX_PATH| replace::
   :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH`
.. |CMAKE_SYSTEM_XXX_MAC_PATH| replace::
   :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH`

.. |CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_XXX| replace::
   :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY`

.. include:: FIND_XXX.txt

When more than one value is given to the ``NAMES`` option this command by
default will consider one name at a time and search every directory
for it.  The ``NAMES_PER_DIR`` option tells this command to consider one
directory at a time and search for all names in it.

Each library name given to the ``NAMES`` option is first considered
as a library file name and then considered with platform-specific
prefixes (e.g. ``lib``) and suffixes (e.g. ``.so``).  Therefore one
may specify library file names such as ``libfoo.a`` directly.
This can be used to locate static libraries on UNIX-like systems.

If the library found is a framework, then ``<VAR>`` will be set to the full
path to the framework ``<fullPath>/A.framework``.  When a full path to a
framework is used as a library, CMake will use a ``-framework A``, and a
``-F<fullPath>`` to link the framework to the target.

If the :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX` variable is set all
search paths will be tested as normal, with the suffix appended, and with
all matches of ``lib/`` replaced with
``lib${CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX}/``.  This variable overrides
the :prop_gbl:`FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS`,
:prop_gbl:`FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS`,
and :prop_gbl:`FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS` global properties.

If the :prop_gbl:`FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS` global property is set
all search paths will be tested as normal, with ``32/`` appended, and
with all matches of ``lib/`` replaced with ``lib32/``.  This property is
automatically set for the platforms that are known to need it if at
least one of the languages supported by the :command:`project` command
is enabled.

If the :prop_gbl:`FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS` global property is set
all search paths will be tested as normal, with ``x32/`` appended, and
with all matches of ``lib/`` replaced with ``libx32/``.  This property is
automatically set for the platforms that are known to need it if at
least one of the languages supported by the :command:`project` command
is enabled.

If the :prop_gbl:`FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS` global property is set
all search paths will be tested as normal, with ``64/`` appended, and
with all matches of ``lib/`` replaced with ``lib64/``.  This property is
automatically set for the platforms that are known to need it if at
least one of the languages supported by the :command:`project` command
is enabled.
target_link_libraries
---------------------

.. only:: html

   .. contents::

Specify libraries or flags to use when linking a given target and/or
its dependents.  :ref:`Usage requirements <Target Usage Requirements>`
from linked library targets will be propagated.  Usage requirements
of a target's dependencies affect compilation of its own sources.

Overview
^^^^^^^^

This command has several signatures as detailed in subsections below.
All of them have the general form::

  target_link_libraries(<target> ... <item>... ...)

The named ``<target>`` must have been created by
a command such as :command:`add_executable` or :command:`add_library` and
must not be an :ref:`ALIAS target <Alias Targets>`.
Repeated calls for the same ``<target>`` append items in the order called.
Each ``<item>`` may be:

* **A library target name**: The generated link line will have the
  full path to the linkable library file associated with the target.
  The buildsystem will have a dependency to re-link ``<target>`` if
  the library file changes.

  The named target must be created by :command:`add_library` within
  the project or as an :ref:`IMPORTED library <Imported Targets>`.
  If it is created within the project an ordering dependency will
  automatically be added in the build system to make sure the named
  library target is up-to-date before the ``<target>`` links.

  If an imported library has the :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_NO_SONAME`
  target property set, CMake may ask the linker to search for
  the library instead of using the full path
  (e.g. ``/usr/lib/libfoo.so`` becomes ``-lfoo``).

* **A full path to a library file**: The generated link line will
  normally preserve the full path to the file. The buildsystem will
  have a dependency to re-link ``<target>`` if the library file changes.

  There are some cases where CMake may ask the linker to search for
  the library (e.g. ``/usr/lib/libfoo.so`` becomes ``-lfoo``), such
  as when a shared library is detected to have no ``SONAME`` field.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0060` for discussion of another case.

  If the library file is in a Mac OSX framework, the ``Headers`` directory
  of the framework will also be processed as a
  :ref:`usage requirement <Target Usage Requirements>`.  This has the same
  effect as passing the framework directory as an include directory.

  On :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above, library files
  ending in ``.targets`` will be treated as MSBuild targets files and
  imported into generated project files.  This is not supported by other
  generators.

* **A plain library name**: The generated link line will ask the linker
  to search for the library (e.g. ``foo`` becomes ``-lfoo`` or ``foo.lib``).

* **A link flag**: Item names starting with ``-``, but not ``-l`` or
  ``-framework``, are treated as linker flags.  Note that such flags will
  be treated like any other library link item for purposes of transitive
  dependencies, so they are generally safe to specify only as private link
  items that will not propagate to dependents.

  Link flags specified here are inserted into the link command in the same
  place as the link libraries. This might not be correct, depending on
  the linker. Use the :prop_tgt:`LINK_FLAGS` target property to add link
  flags explicitly. The flags will then be placed at the toolchain-defined
  flag position in the link command.

* A ``debug``, ``optimized``, or ``general`` keyword immediately followed
  by another ``<item>``.  The item following such a keyword will be used
  only for the corresponding build configuration.  The ``debug`` keyword
  corresponds to the ``Debug`` configuration (or to configurations named
  in the :prop_gbl:`DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS` global property if it is set).
  The ``optimized`` keyword corresponds to all other configurations.  The
  ``general`` keyword corresponds to all configurations, and is purely
  optional.  Higher granularity may be achieved for per-configuration
  rules by creating and linking to
  :ref:`IMPORTED library targets <Imported Targets>`.

Items containing ``::``, such as ``Foo::Bar``, are assumed to be
:ref:`IMPORTED <Imported Targets>` or :ref:`ALIAS <Alias Targets>` library
target names and will cause an error if no such target exists.
See policy :policy:`CMP0028`.

Arguments to ``target_link_libraries`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  Note however, that generator expressions
will not be used in OLD handling of :policy:`CMP0003` or :policy:`CMP0004`.
See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual for available
expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)` manual for more on
defining buildsystem properties.

Libraries for a Target and/or its Dependents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  target_link_libraries(<target>
                        <PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE> <item>...
                       [<PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE> <item>...]...)

The ``PUBLIC``, ``PRIVATE`` and ``INTERFACE`` keywords can be used to
specify both the link dependencies and the link interface in one command.
Libraries and targets following ``PUBLIC`` are linked to, and are made
part of the link interface.  Libraries and targets following ``PRIVATE``
are linked to, but are not made part of the link interface.  Libraries
following ``INTERFACE`` are appended to the link interface and are not
used for linking ``<target>``.

Libraries for both a Target and its Dependents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  target_link_libraries(<target> <item>...)

Library dependencies are transitive by default with this signature.
When this target is linked into another target then the libraries
linked to this target will appear on the link line for the other
target too.  This transitive "link interface" is stored in the
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` target property and may be overridden
by setting the property directly.  When :policy:`CMP0022` is not set to
``NEW``, transitive linking is built in but may be overridden by the
:prop_tgt:`LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES` property.  Calls to other signatures
of this command may set the property making any libraries linked
exclusively by this signature private.

Libraries for a Target and/or its Dependents (Legacy)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  target_link_libraries(<target>
                        <LINK_PRIVATE|LINK_PUBLIC> <lib>...
                       [<LINK_PRIVATE|LINK_PUBLIC> <lib>...]...)

The ``LINK_PUBLIC`` and ``LINK_PRIVATE`` modes can be used to specify both
the link dependencies and the link interface in one command.

This signature is for compatibility only.  Prefer the ``PUBLIC`` or
``PRIVATE`` keywords instead.

Libraries and targets following ``LINK_PUBLIC`` are linked to, and are
made part of the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`.  If policy
:policy:`CMP0022` is not ``NEW``, they are also made part of the
:prop_tgt:`LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES`.  Libraries and targets following
``LINK_PRIVATE`` are linked to, but are not made part of the
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` (or :prop_tgt:`LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES`).

Libraries for Dependents Only (Legacy)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  target_link_libraries(<target> LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES <item>...)

The ``LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES`` mode appends the libraries to the
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` target property instead of using them
for linking.  If policy :policy:`CMP0022` is not ``NEW``, then this mode
also appends libraries to the :prop_tgt:`LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES` and its
per-configuration equivalent.

This signature is for compatibility only.  Prefer the ``INTERFACE`` mode
instead.

Libraries specified as ``debug`` are wrapped in a generator expression to
correspond to debug builds.  If policy :policy:`CMP0022` is
not ``NEW``, the libraries are also appended to the
:prop_tgt:`LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_DEBUG <LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>>`
property (or to the properties corresponding to configurations listed in
the :prop_gbl:`DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS` global property if it is set).
Libraries specified as ``optimized`` are appended to the
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` property.  If policy :policy:`CMP0022`
is not ``NEW``, they are also appended to the
:prop_tgt:`LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES` property.  Libraries specified as
``general`` (or without any keyword) are treated as if specified for both
``debug`` and ``optimized``.

Linking Object Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`Object Libraries` may be used as the ``<target>`` (first) argument
of ``target_link_libraries`` to specify dependencies of their sources
on other libraries.  For example, the code

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(A SHARED a.c)
  target_compile_definitions(A PUBLIC A)

  add_library(obj OBJECT obj.c)
  target_compile_definitions(obj PUBLIC OBJ)
  target_link_libraries(obj PUBLIC A)

compiles ``obj.c`` with ``-DA -DOBJ`` and establishes usage requirements
for ``obj`` that propagate to its dependents.

Normal libraries and executables may link to :ref:`Object Libraries`
to get their objects and usage requirements.  Continuing the above
example, the code

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(B SHARED b.c)
  target_link_libraries(B PUBLIC obj)

compiles ``b.c`` with ``-DA -DOBJ``, creates shared library ``B``
with object files from ``b.c`` and ``obj.c``, and links ``B`` to ``A``.
Furthermore, the code

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_executable(main main.c)
  target_link_libraries(main B)

compiles ``main.c`` with ``-DA -DOBJ`` and links executable ``main``
to ``B`` and ``A``.  The object library's usage requirements are
propagated transitively through ``B``, but its object files are not.

:ref:`Object Libraries` may "link" to other object libraries to get
usage requirements, but since they do not have a link step nothing
is done with their object files.  Continuing from the above example,
the code:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(obj2 OBJECT obj2.c)
  target_link_libraries(obj2 PUBLIC obj)

  add_executable(main2 main2.c)
  target_link_libraries(main2 obj2)

compiles ``obj2.c`` with ``-DA -DOBJ``, creates executable ``main2``
with object files from ``main2.c`` and ``obj2.c``, and links ``main2``
to ``A``.

In other words, when :ref:`Object Libraries` appear in a target's
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` property they will be
treated as :ref:`Interface Libraries`, but when they appear in
a target's :prop_tgt:`LINK_LIBRARIES` property their object files
will be included in the link too.

Cyclic Dependencies of Static Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The library dependency graph is normally acyclic (a DAG), but in the case
of mutually-dependent ``STATIC`` libraries CMake allows the graph to
contain cycles (strongly connected components).  When another target links
to one of the libraries, CMake repeats the entire connected component.
For example, the code

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(A STATIC a.c)
  add_library(B STATIC b.c)
  target_link_libraries(A B)
  target_link_libraries(B A)
  add_executable(main main.c)
  target_link_libraries(main A)

links ``main`` to ``A B A B``.  While one repetition is usually
sufficient, pathological object file and symbol arrangements can require
more.  One may handle such cases by using the
:prop_tgt:`LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY` target property or by manually
repeating the component in the last ``target_link_libraries`` call.
However, if two archives are really so interdependent they should probably
be combined into a single archive, perhaps by using :ref:`Object Libraries`.

When more than one value is given to the ``NAMES`` option this command by
default will consider one name at a time and search every directory
for it.  The ``NAMES_PER_DIR`` option tells this command to consider one
directory at a time and search for all names in it.
if
--

Conditionally execute a group of commands.

.. code-block:: cmake

 if(expression)
   # then section.
   COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
   COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
   #...
 elseif(expression2)
   # elseif section.
   COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
   COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
   #...
 else(expression)
   # else section.
   COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
   COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
   #...
 endif(expression)

Evaluates the given expression.  If the result is true, the commands
in the THEN section are invoked.  Otherwise, the commands in the else
section are invoked.  The elseif and else sections are optional.  You
may have multiple elseif clauses.  Note that the expression in the
else and endif clause is optional.  Long expressions can be used and
there is a traditional order of precedence.  Parenthetical expressions
are evaluated first followed by unary tests such as ``EXISTS``,
``COMMAND``, and ``DEFINED``.  Then any binary tests such as
``EQUAL``, ``LESS``, ``LESS_EQUAL``, ``GREATER``, ``GREATER_EQUAL``,
``STREQUAL``, ``STRLESS``, ``STRLESS_EQUAL``, ``STRGREATER``,
``STRGREATER_EQUAL``, ``VERSION_EQUAL``, ``VERSION_LESS``,
``VERSION_LESS_EQUAL``, ``VERSION_GREATER``, ``VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL``,
and ``MATCHES`` will be evaluated.  Then boolean ``NOT`` operators and
finally boolean ``AND`` and then ``OR`` operators will be evaluated.

Possible expressions are:

``if(<constant>)``
 True if the constant is ``1``, ``ON``, ``YES``, ``TRUE``, ``Y``,
 or a non-zero number.  False if the constant is ``0``, ``OFF``,
 ``NO``, ``FALSE``, ``N``, ``IGNORE``, ``NOTFOUND``, the empty string,
 or ends in the suffix ``-NOTFOUND``.  Named boolean constants are
 case-insensitive.  If the argument is not one of these specific
 constants, it is treated as a variable or string and the following
 signature is used.

``if(<variable|string>)``
 True if given a variable that is defined to a value that is not a false
 constant.  False otherwise.  (Note macro arguments are not variables.)

``if(NOT <expression>)``
 True if the expression is not true.

``if(<expr1> AND <expr2>)``
 True if both expressions would be considered true individually.

``if(<expr1> OR <expr2>)``
 True if either expression would be considered true individually.

``if(COMMAND command-name)``
 True if the given name is a command, macro or function that can be
 invoked.

``if(POLICY policy-id)``
 True if the given name is an existing policy (of the form ``CMP<NNNN>``).

``if(TARGET target-name)``
 True if the given name is an existing logical target name created
 by a call to the :command:`add_executable`, :command:`add_library`,
 or :command:`add_custom_target` command that has already been invoked
 (in any directory).

``if(TEST test-name)``
 True if the given name is an existing test name created by the
 :command:`add_test` command.

``if(EXISTS path-to-file-or-directory)``
 True if the named file or directory exists.  Behavior is well-defined
 only for full paths.

``if(file1 IS_NEWER_THAN file2)``
 True if ``file1`` is newer than ``file2`` or if one of the two files doesn't
 exist.  Behavior is well-defined only for full paths.  If the file
 time stamps are exactly the same, an ``IS_NEWER_THAN`` comparison returns
 true, so that any dependent build operations will occur in the event
 of a tie.  This includes the case of passing the same file name for
 both file1 and file2.

``if(IS_DIRECTORY path-to-directory)``
 True if the given name is a directory.  Behavior is well-defined only
 for full paths.

``if(IS_SYMLINK file-name)``
 True if the given name is a symbolic link.  Behavior is well-defined
 only for full paths.

``if(IS_ABSOLUTE path)``
 True if the given path is an absolute path.

``if(<variable|string> MATCHES regex)``
 True if the given string or variable's value matches the given regular
 expression.  See :ref:`Regex Specification` for regex format.
 ``()`` groups are captured in :variable:`CMAKE_MATCH_<n>` variables.

``if(<variable|string> LESS <variable|string>)``
 True if the given string or variable's value is a valid number and less
 than that on the right.

``if(<variable|string> GREATER <variable|string>)``
 True if the given string or variable's value is a valid number and greater
 than that on the right.

``if(<variable|string> EQUAL <variable|string>)``
 True if the given string or variable's value is a valid number and equal
 to that on the right.

``if(<variable|string> LESS_EQUAL <variable|string>)``
 True if the given string or variable's value is a valid number and less
 than or equal to that on the right.

``if(<variable|string> GREATER_EQUAL <variable|string>)``
 True if the given string or variable's value is a valid number and greater
 than or equal to that on the right.

``if(<variable|string> STRLESS <variable|string>)``
 True if the given string or variable's value is lexicographically less
 than the string or variable on the right.

``if(<variable|string> STRGREATER <variable|string>)``
 True if the given string or variable's value is lexicographically greater
 than the string or variable on the right.

``if(<variable|string> STREQUAL <variable|string>)``
 True if the given string or variable's value is lexicographically equal
 to the string or variable on the right.

``if(<variable|string> STRLESS_EQUAL <variable|string>)``
 True if the given string or variable's value is lexicographically less
 than or equal to the string or variable on the right.

``if(<variable|string> STRGREATER_EQUAL <variable|string>)``
 True if the given string or variable's value is lexicographically greater
 than or equal to the string or variable on the right.

``if(<variable|string> VERSION_LESS <variable|string>)``
 Component-wise integer version number comparison (version format is
 ``major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]``).

``if(<variable|string> VERSION_GREATER <variable|string>)``
 Component-wise integer version number comparison (version format is
 ``major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]``).

``if(<variable|string> VERSION_EQUAL <variable|string>)``
 Component-wise integer version number comparison (version format is
 ``major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]``).

``if(<variable|string> VERSION_LESS_EQUAL <variable|string>)``
 Component-wise integer version number comparison (version format is
 ``major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]``).

``if(<variable|string> VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL <variable|string>)``
 Component-wise integer version number comparison (version format is
 ``major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]``).

``if(<variable|string> IN_LIST <variable>)``
 True if the given element is contained in the named list variable.

``if(DEFINED <variable>)``
 True if the given variable is defined.  It does not matter if the
 variable is true or false just if it has been set.  (Note macro
 arguments are not variables.)

``if((expression) AND (expression OR (expression)))``
 The expressions inside the parenthesis are evaluated first and then
 the remaining expression is evaluated as in the previous examples.
 Where there are nested parenthesis the innermost are evaluated as part
 of evaluating the expression that contains them.

The if command was written very early in CMake's history, predating
the ``${}`` variable evaluation syntax, and for convenience evaluates
variables named by its arguments as shown in the above signatures.
Note that normal variable evaluation with ``${}`` applies before the if
command even receives the arguments.  Therefore code like::

 set(var1 OFF)
 set(var2 "var1")
 if(${var2})

appears to the if command as::

 if(var1)

and is evaluated according to the ``if(<variable>)`` case documented
above.  The result is ``OFF`` which is false.  However, if we remove the
``${}`` from the example then the command sees::

 if(var2)

which is true because ``var2`` is defined to "var1" which is not a false
constant.

Automatic evaluation applies in the other cases whenever the
above-documented signature accepts ``<variable|string>``:

* The left hand argument to ``MATCHES`` is first checked to see if it is
  a defined variable, if so the variable's value is used, otherwise the
  original value is used.

* If the left hand argument to ``MATCHES`` is missing it returns false
  without error

* Both left and right hand arguments to ``LESS``, ``GREATER``, ``EQUAL``,
  ``LESS_EQUAL``, and ``GREATER_EQUAL``, are independently tested to see if
  they are defined variables, if so their defined values are used otherwise
  the original value is used.

* Both left and right hand arguments to ``STRLESS``, ``STRGREATER``,
  ``STREQUAL``, ``STRLESS_EQUAL``, and ``STRGREATER_EQUAL`` are independently
  tested to see if they are defined variables, if so their defined values are
  used otherwise the original value is used.

* Both left and right hand arguments to ``VERSION_LESS``,
  ``VERSION_GREATER``, ``VERSION_EQUAL``, ``VERSION_LESS_EQUAL``, and
  ``VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL`` are independently tested to see if they are defined
  variables, if so their defined values are used otherwise the original value
  is used.

* The right hand argument to ``NOT`` is tested to see if it is a boolean
  constant, if so the value is used, otherwise it is assumed to be a
  variable and it is dereferenced.

* The left and right hand arguments to ``AND`` and ``OR`` are independently
  tested to see if they are boolean constants, if so they are used as
  such, otherwise they are assumed to be variables and are dereferenced.

To prevent ambiguity, potential variable or keyword names can be
specified in a :ref:`Quoted Argument` or a :ref:`Bracket Argument`.
A quoted or bracketed variable or keyword will be interpreted as a
string and not dereferenced or interpreted.
See policy :policy:`CMP0054`.
function
--------

Start recording a function for later invocation as a command::

  function(<name> [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
    COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
    COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
    ...
  endfunction(<name>)

Define a function named ``<name>`` that takes arguments named ``arg1``,
``arg2``, ``arg3``, (...).
Commands listed after function, but before the matching
:command:`endfunction()`, are not invoked until the function is invoked.
When it is invoked, the commands recorded in the function are first
modified by replacing formal parameters (``${arg1}``) with the arguments
passed, and then invoked as normal commands.
In addition to referencing the formal parameters you can reference the
``ARGC`` variable which will be set to the number of arguments passed
into the function as well as ``ARGV0``, ``ARGV1``, ``ARGV2``, ...  which
will have the actual values of the arguments passed in.
This facilitates creating functions with optional arguments.
Additionally ``ARGV`` holds the list of all arguments given to the
function and ``ARGN`` holds the list of arguments past the last expected
argument.
Referencing to ``ARGV#`` arguments beyond ``ARGC`` have undefined
behavior. Checking that ``ARGC`` is greater than ``#`` is the only way
to ensure that ``ARGV#`` was passed to the function as an extra
argument.

A function opens a new scope: see :command:`set(var PARENT_SCOPE)` for
details.

See the :command:`cmake_policy()` command documentation for the behavior
of policies inside functions.
set_directory_properties
------------------------

Set a property of the directory.

::

  set_directory_properties(PROPERTIES prop1 value1 prop2 value2)

Set a property for the current directory and subdirectories. See
:ref:`Directory Properties` for the list of properties known
to CMake.
try_run
-------

.. only:: html

   .. contents::

Try compiling and then running some code.

Try Compiling and Running Source Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  try_run(RUN_RESULT_VAR COMPILE_RESULT_VAR
          bindir srcfile [CMAKE_FLAGS <flags>...]
          [COMPILE_DEFINITIONS <defs>...]
          [LINK_LIBRARIES <libs>...]
          [COMPILE_OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>]
          [RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>]
          [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>]
          [ARGS <args>...])

Try compiling a ``<srcfile>``.  Returns ``TRUE`` or ``FALSE`` for success
or failure in ``COMPILE_RESULT_VAR``.  If the compile succeeded, runs the
executable and returns its exit code in ``RUN_RESULT_VAR``.  If the
executable was built, but failed to run, then ``RUN_RESULT_VAR`` will be
set to ``FAILED_TO_RUN``.  See the :command:`try_compile` command for
information on how the test project is constructed to build the source file.

The options are:

``CMAKE_FLAGS <flags>...``
  Specify flags of the form ``-DVAR:TYPE=VALUE`` to be passed to
  the ``cmake`` command-line used to drive the test build.
  The example in :command:`try_compile` shows how values for variables
  ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, ``LINK_DIRECTORIES``, and ``LINK_LIBRARIES``
  are used.

``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS <defs>...``
  Specify ``-Ddefinition`` arguments to pass to ``add_definitions``
  in the generated test project.

``COMPILE_OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>``
  Report the compile step build output in a given variable.

``LINK_LIBRARIES <libs>...``
  Specify libraries to be linked in the generated project.
  The list of libraries may refer to system libraries and to
  :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` from the calling project.

  If this option is specified, any ``-DLINK_LIBRARIES=...`` value
  given to the ``CMAKE_FLAGS`` option will be ignored.

``OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>``
  Report the compile build output and the output from running the executable
  in the given variable.  This option exists for legacy reasons.  Prefer
  ``COMPILE_OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` and ``RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` instead.

``RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>``
  Report the output from running the executable in a given variable.

Other Behavior Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set the :variable:`CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION` variable to choose
a build configuration.

Behavior when Cross Compiling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When cross compiling, the executable compiled in the first step
usually cannot be run on the build host.  The ``try_run`` command checks
the :variable:`CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING` variable to detect whether CMake is in
cross-compiling mode.  If that is the case, it will still try to compile
the executable, but it will not try to run the executable unless the
:variable:`CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR` variable is set.  Instead it
will create cache variables which must be filled by the user or by
presetting them in some CMake script file to the values the executable
would have produced if it had been run on its actual target platform.
These cache entries are:

``<RUN_RESULT_VAR>``
  Exit code if the executable were to be run on the target platform.

``<RUN_RESULT_VAR>__TRYRUN_OUTPUT``
  Output from stdout and stderr if the executable were to be run on
  the target platform.  This is created only if the
  ``RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` or ``OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` option was used.

In order to make cross compiling your project easier, use ``try_run``
only if really required.  If you use ``try_run``, use the
``RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` or ``OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` options only if really
required.  Using them will require that when cross-compiling, the cache
variables will have to be set manually to the output of the executable.
You can also "guard" the calls to ``try_run`` with an :command:`if`
block checking the :variable:`CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING` variable and
provide an easy-to-preset alternative for this case.
target_compile_features
-----------------------

Add expected compiler features to a target.

::

  target_compile_features(<target> <PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE> <feature> [...])

Specify compiler features required when compiling a given target.  If the
feature is not listed in the :variable:`CMAKE_C_COMPILE_FEATURES` variable
or :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILE_FEATURES` variable,
then an error will be reported by CMake.  If the use of the feature requires
an additional compiler flag, such as ``-std=gnu++11``, the flag will be added
automatically.

The ``INTERFACE``, ``PUBLIC`` and ``PRIVATE`` keywords are required to
specify the scope of the features.  ``PRIVATE`` and ``PUBLIC`` items will
populate the :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_FEATURES` property of ``<target>``.
``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` items will populate the
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_COMPILE_FEATURES` property of ``<target>``.
(:ref:`IMPORTED targets <Imported Targets>` only support ``INTERFACE`` items.)
Repeated calls for the same ``<target>`` append items.

The named ``<target>`` must have been created by a command such as
:command:`add_executable` or :command:`add_library` and must not be an
:ref:`ALIAS target <Alias Targets>`.

Arguments to ``target_compile_features`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.
See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual for available
expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for
information on compile features and a list of supported compilers.
ctest_empty_binary_directory
----------------------------

empties the binary directory

::

  ctest_empty_binary_directory( directory )

Removes a binary directory.  This command will perform some checks
prior to deleting the directory in an attempt to avoid malicious or
accidental directory deletion.
include_regular_expression
--------------------------

Set the regular expression used for dependency checking.

::

  include_regular_expression(regex_match [regex_complain])

Set the regular expressions used in dependency checking.  Only files
matching ``regex_match`` will be traced as dependencies.  Only files
matching ``regex_complain`` will generate warnings if they cannot be found
(standard header paths are not searched).  The defaults are:

::

  regex_match    = "^.*$" (match everything)
  regex_complain = "^$" (match empty string only)
while
-----

Evaluate a group of commands while a condition is true

::

  while(condition)
    COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
    COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
    ...
  endwhile(condition)

All commands between while and the matching :command:`endwhile` are recorded
without being invoked.  Once the :command:`endwhile` is evaluated, the
recorded list of commands is invoked as long as the condition is true.  The
condition is evaluated using the same logic as the :command:`if` command.
endforeach
----------

Ends a list of commands in a foreach block.

::

  endforeach(expression)

See the :command:`foreach` command.
target_compile_definitions
--------------------------

Add compile definitions to a target.

::

  target_compile_definitions(<target>
    <INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [items1...]
    [<INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [items2...] ...])

Specify compile definitions to use when compiling a given ``<target>``.  The
named ``<target>`` must have been created by a command such as
:command:`add_executable` or :command:`add_library` and must not be an
:ref:`ALIAS target <Alias Targets>`.

The ``INTERFACE``, ``PUBLIC`` and ``PRIVATE`` keywords are required to
specify the scope of the following arguments.  ``PRIVATE`` and ``PUBLIC``
items will populate the :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` property of
``<target>``. ``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` items will populate the
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` property of ``<target>``.
(:ref:`IMPORTED targets <Imported Targets>` only support ``INTERFACE`` items.)
The following arguments specify compile definitions.  Repeated calls for the
same ``<target>`` append items in the order called.

Arguments to ``target_compile_definitions`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
manual for available expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)`
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

Any leading ``-D`` on an item will be removed.  Empty items are ignored.
For example, the following are all equivalent:

.. code-block:: cmake

  target_compile_definitions(foo PUBLIC FOO)
  target_compile_definitions(foo PUBLIC -DFOO)  # -D removed
  target_compile_definitions(foo PUBLIC "" FOO) # "" ignored
  target_compile_definitions(foo PUBLIC -D FOO) # -D becomes "", then ignored
add_library
-----------

.. only:: html

   .. contents::

Add a library to the project using the specified source files.

Normal Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  add_library(<name> [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE]
              [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
              [source1] [source2 ...])

Adds a library target called ``<name>`` to be built from the source files
listed in the command invocation.  (The source files can be omitted here
if they are added later using :command:`target_sources`.)  The ``<name>``
corresponds to the logical target name and must be globally unique within
a project.  The actual file name of the library built is constructed based
on conventions of the native platform (such as ``lib<name>.a`` or
``<name>.lib``).

``STATIC``, ``SHARED``, or ``MODULE`` may be given to specify the type of
library to be created.  ``STATIC`` libraries are archives of object files
for use when linking other targets.  ``SHARED`` libraries are linked
dynamically and loaded at runtime.  ``MODULE`` libraries are plugins that
are not linked into other targets but may be loaded dynamically at runtime
using dlopen-like functionality.  If no type is given explicitly the
type is ``STATIC`` or ``SHARED`` based on whether the current value of the
variable :variable:`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` is ``ON``.  For ``SHARED`` and
``MODULE`` libraries the :prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` target
property is set to ``ON`` automatically.
A ``SHARED`` or ``STATIC`` library may be marked with the :prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK`
target property to create an OS X Framework.

If a library does not export any symbols, it must not be declared as a
``SHARED`` library.  For example, a Windows resource DLL or a managed C++/CLI
DLL that exports no unmanaged symbols would need to be a ``MODULE`` library.
This is because CMake expects a ``SHARED`` library to always have an
associated import library on Windows.

By default the library file will be created in the build tree directory
corresponding to the source tree directory in which the command was
invoked.  See documentation of the :prop_tgt:`ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`,
:prop_tgt:`LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`, and
:prop_tgt:`RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` target properties to change this
location.  See documentation of the :prop_tgt:`OUTPUT_NAME` target
property to change the ``<name>`` part of the final file name.

If ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` is given the corresponding property will be set on
the created target.  See documentation of the :prop_tgt:`EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`
target property for details.

Source arguments to ``add_library`` may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
manual for available expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)`
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

See also :prop_sf:`HEADER_FILE_ONLY` on what to do if some sources are
pre-processed, and you want to have the original sources reachable from
within IDE.

Imported Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  add_library(<name> <SHARED|STATIC|MODULE|OBJECT|UNKNOWN> IMPORTED
              [GLOBAL])

An :ref:`IMPORTED library target <Imported Targets>` references a library
file located outside the project.  No rules are generated to build it, and
the :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` target property is ``True``.  The target name has
scope in the directory in which it is created and below, but the ``GLOBAL``
option extends visibility.  It may be referenced like any target built
within the project.  ``IMPORTED`` libraries are useful for convenient
reference from commands like :command:`target_link_libraries`.  Details
about the imported library are specified by setting properties whose names
begin in ``IMPORTED_`` and ``INTERFACE_``.  The most important such
property is :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION` (and its per-configuration
variant :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>`) which specifies the
location of the main library file on disk.  See documentation of the
``IMPORTED_*`` and ``INTERFACE_*`` properties for more information.

Object Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  add_library(<name> OBJECT <src>...)

Creates an :ref:`Object Library <Object Libraries>`.  An object library
compiles source files but does not archive or link their object files into a
library.  Instead other targets created by :command:`add_library` or
:command:`add_executable` may reference the objects using an expression of the
form ``$<TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib>`` as a source, where ``objlib`` is the
object library name.  For example:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_library(... $<TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib> ...)
  add_executable(... $<TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib> ...)

will include objlib's object files in a library and an executable
along with those compiled from their own sources.  Object libraries
may contain only sources that compile, header files, and other files
that would not affect linking of a normal library (e.g. ``.txt``).
They may contain custom commands generating such sources, but not
``PRE_BUILD``, ``PRE_LINK``, or ``POST_BUILD`` commands.  Some native build
systems (such as Xcode) may not like targets that have only object files, so
consider adding at least one real source file to any target that references
``$<TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib>``.

Alias Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  add_library(<name> ALIAS <target>)

Creates an :ref:`Alias Target <Alias Targets>`, such that ``<name>`` can be
used to refer to ``<target>`` in subsequent commands.  The ``<name>`` does
not appear in the generated buildsystem as a make target.  The ``<target>``
may not be a non-``GLOBAL`` :ref:`Imported Target <Imported Targets>` or an
``ALIAS``.
``ALIAS`` targets can be used as linkable targets and as targets to
read properties from.  They can also be tested for existence with the
regular :command:`if(TARGET)` subcommand.  The ``<name>`` may not be used
to modify properties of ``<target>``, that is, it may not be used as the
operand of :command:`set_property`, :command:`set_target_properties`,
:command:`target_link_libraries` etc.  An ``ALIAS`` target may not be
installed or exported.

Interface Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  add_library(<name> INTERFACE [IMPORTED [GLOBAL]])

Creates an :ref:`Interface Library <Interface Libraries>`.  An ``INTERFACE``
library target does not directly create build output, though it may
have properties set on it and it may be installed, exported and
imported. Typically the ``INTERFACE_*`` properties are populated on
the interface target using the commands:

* :command:`set_property`,
* :command:`target_link_libraries(INTERFACE)`,
* :command:`target_include_directories(INTERFACE)`,
* :command:`target_compile_options(INTERFACE)`,
* :command:`target_compile_definitions(INTERFACE)`, and
* :command:`target_sources(INTERFACE)`,

and then it is used as an argument to :command:`target_link_libraries`
like any other target.

An ``INTERFACE`` :ref:`Imported Target <Imported Targets>` may also be
created with this signature.  An ``IMPORTED`` library target references a
library defined outside the project.  The target name has scope in the
directory in which it is created and below, but the ``GLOBAL`` option
extends visibility.  It may be referenced like any target built within
the project.  ``IMPORTED`` libraries are useful for convenient reference
from commands like :command:`target_link_libraries`.
add_subdirectory
----------------

Add a subdirectory to the build.

::

  add_subdirectory(source_dir [binary_dir]
                   [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL])

Add a subdirectory to the build.  The source_dir specifies the
directory in which the source CMakeLists.txt and code files are
located.  If it is a relative path it will be evaluated with respect
to the current directory (the typical usage), but it may also be an
absolute path.  The ``binary_dir`` specifies the directory in which to
place the output files.  If it is a relative path it will be evaluated
with respect to the current output directory, but it may also be an
absolute path.  If ``binary_dir`` is not specified, the value of
``source_dir``, before expanding any relative path, will be used (the
typical usage).  The CMakeLists.txt file in the specified source
directory will be processed immediately by CMake before processing in
the current input file continues beyond this command.

If the ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` argument is provided then targets in the
subdirectory will not be included in the ``ALL`` target of the parent
directory by default, and will be excluded from IDE project files.
Users must explicitly build targets in the subdirectory.  This is
meant for use when the subdirectory contains a separate part of the
project that is useful but not necessary, such as a set of examples.
Typically the subdirectory should contain its own :command:`project`
command invocation so that a full build system will be generated in the
subdirectory (such as a VS IDE solution file).  Note that inter-target
dependencies supersede this exclusion.  If a target built by the
parent project depends on a target in the subdirectory, the dependee
target will be included in the parent project build system to satisfy
the dependency.
build_name
----------

Disallowed.  See CMake Policy :policy:`CMP0036`.

Use ``${CMAKE_SYSTEM}`` and ``${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER}`` instead.

::

  build_name(variable)

Sets the specified variable to a string representing the platform and
compiler settings.  These values are now available through the
:variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM` and
:variable:`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER <CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER>` variables.
endwhile
--------

Ends a list of commands in a while block.

::

  endwhile(expression)

See the :command:`while` command.
utility_source
--------------

Disallowed.  See CMake Policy :policy:`CMP0034`.

Specify the source tree of a third-party utility.

::

  utility_source(cache_entry executable_name
                 path_to_source [file1 file2 ...])

When a third-party utility's source is included in the distribution,
this command specifies its location and name.  The cache entry will
not be set unless the ``path_to_source`` and all listed files exist.  It
is assumed that the source tree of the utility will have been built
before it is needed.

When cross compiling CMake will print a warning if a ``utility_source()``
command is executed, because in many cases it is used to build an
executable which is executed later on.  This doesn't work when cross
compiling, since the executable can run only on their target platform.
So in this case the cache entry has to be adjusted manually so it
points to an executable which is runnable on the build host.
get_test_property
-----------------

Get a property of the test.

::

  get_test_property(test property VAR)

Get a property from the test.  The value of the property is stored in
the variable ``VAR``.  If the test property is not found, the behavior
depends on whether it has been defined to be an ``INHERITED`` property
or not (see :command:`define_property`).  Non-inherited properties will
set ``VAR`` to "NOTFOUND", whereas inherited properties will search the
relevant parent scope as described for the :command:`define_property`
command and if still unable to find the property, ``VAR`` will be set to
an empty string.

For a list of standard properties you can type ``cmake --help-property-list``.

See also the more general :command:`get_property` command.
set
---

Set a normal, cache, or environment variable to a given value.
See the :ref:`cmake-language(7) variables <CMake Language Variables>`
documentation for the scopes and interaction of normal variables
and cache entries.

Signatures of this command that specify a ``<value>...`` placeholder
expect zero or more arguments.  Multiple arguments will be joined as
a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` to form the actual variable
value to be set.  Zero arguments will cause normal variables to be
unset.  See the :command:`unset` command to unset variables explicitly.

Set Normal Variable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  set(<variable> <value>... [PARENT_SCOPE])

Set the given ``<variable>`` in the current function or directory scope.

If the ``PARENT_SCOPE`` option is given the variable will be set in
the scope above the current scope.  Each new directory or function
creates a new scope.  This command will set the value of a variable
into the parent directory or calling function (whichever is applicable
to the case at hand). The previous state of the variable's value stays the
same in the current scope (e.g., if it was undefined before, it is still
undefined and if it had a value, it is still that value).

Set Cache Entry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  set(<variable> <value>... CACHE <type> <docstring> [FORCE])

Set the given cache ``<variable>`` (cache entry).  Since cache entries
are meant to provide user-settable values this does not overwrite
existing cache entries by default.  Use the ``FORCE`` option to
overwrite existing entries.

The ``<type>`` must be specified as one of:

``BOOL``
  Boolean ``ON/OFF`` value.  :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` offers a checkbox.

``FILEPATH``
  Path to a file on disk.  :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` offers a file dialog.

``PATH``
  Path to a directory on disk.  :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` offers a file dialog.

``STRING``
  A line of text.  :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` offers a text field or a
  drop-down selection if the :prop_cache:`STRINGS` cache entry
  property is set.

``INTERNAL``
  A line of text.  :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` does not show internal entries.
  They may be used to store variables persistently across runs.
  Use of this type implies ``FORCE``.

The ``<docstring>`` must be specified as a line of text providing
a quick summary of the option for presentation to :manual:`cmake-gui(1)`
users.

If the cache entry does not exist prior to the call or the ``FORCE``
option is given then the cache entry will be set to the given value.
Furthermore, any normal variable binding in the current scope will
be removed to expose the newly cached value to any immediately
following evaluation.

It is possible for the cache entry to exist prior to the call but
have no type set if it was created on the :manual:`cmake(1)` command
line by a user through the ``-D<var>=<value>`` option without
specifying a type.  In this case the ``set`` command will add the
type.  Furthermore, if the ``<type>`` is ``PATH`` or ``FILEPATH``
and the ``<value>`` provided on the command line is a relative path,
then the ``set`` command will treat the path as relative to the
current working directory and convert it to an absolute path.

Set Environment Variable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  set(ENV{<variable>} <value>...)

Set the current process environment ``<variable>`` to the given value.
qt_wrap_cpp
-----------

Create Qt Wrappers.

::

  qt_wrap_cpp(resultingLibraryName DestName
              SourceLists ...)

Produce moc files for all the .h files listed in the SourceLists.  The
moc files will be added to the library using the ``DestName`` source list.
get_directory_property
----------------------

Get a property of ``DIRECTORY`` scope.

::

  get_directory_property(<variable> [DIRECTORY <dir>] <prop-name>)

Store a property of directory scope in the named ``<variable>``.
The ``DIRECTORY`` argument specifies another directory from which
to retrieve the property value instead of the current directory.
The specified directory must have already been traversed by CMake.

If the property is not defined for the nominated directory scope,
an empty string is returned.  In the case of ``INHERITED`` properties,
if the property is not found for the nominated directory scope,
the search will chain to a parent scope as described for the
:command:`define_property` command.

::

  get_directory_property(<variable> [DIRECTORY <dir>]
                         DEFINITION <var-name>)

Get a variable definition from a directory.  This form is useful to
get a variable definition from another directory.

See also the more general :command:`get_property` command.
export_library_dependencies
---------------------------

Disallowed.  See CMake Policy :policy:`CMP0033`.

Use :command:`install(EXPORT)` or :command:`export` command.

This command generates an old-style library dependencies file.
Projects requiring CMake 2.6 or later should not use the command.  Use
instead the :command:`install(EXPORT)` command to help export targets from an
installation tree and the :command:`export` command to export targets from a
build tree.

The old-style library dependencies file does not take into account
per-configuration names of libraries or the
:prop_tgt:`LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES` target property.

::

  export_library_dependencies(<file> [APPEND])

Create a file named ``<file>`` that can be included into a CMake listfile
with the INCLUDE command.  The file will contain a number of SET
commands that will set all the variables needed for library dependency
information.  This should be the last command in the top level
CMakeLists.txt file of the project.  If the ``APPEND`` option is
specified, the SET commands will be appended to the given file instead
of replacing it.
subdir_depends
--------------

Disallowed.  See CMake Policy :policy:`CMP0029`.

Does nothing.

::

  subdir_depends(subdir dep1 dep2 ...)

Does not do anything.  This command used to help projects order
parallel builds correctly.  This functionality is now automatic.
set_property
------------

Set a named property in a given scope.

::

  set_property(<GLOBAL                            |
                DIRECTORY [dir]                   |
                TARGET    [target1 [target2 ...]] |
                SOURCE    [src1 [src2 ...]]       |
                INSTALL   [file1 [file2 ...]]     |
                TEST      [test1 [test2 ...]]     |
                CACHE     [entry1 [entry2 ...]]>
               [APPEND] [APPEND_STRING]
               PROPERTY <name> [value1 [value2 ...]])

Set one property on zero or more objects of a scope.  The first
argument determines the scope in which the property is set.  It must
be one of the following:

``GLOBAL``
  Scope is unique and does not accept a name.

``DIRECTORY``
  Scope defaults to the current directory but another
  directory (already processed by CMake) may be named by full or
  relative path.

``TARGET``
  Scope may name zero or more existing targets.

``SOURCE``
  Scope may name zero or more source files.  Note that source
  file properties are visible only to targets added in the same
  directory (CMakeLists.txt).

``INSTALL``
  Scope may name zero or more installed file paths.
  These are made available to CPack to influence deployment.

  Both the property key and value may use generator expressions.
  Specific properties may apply to installed files and/or directories.

  Path components have to be separated by forward slashes,
  must be normalized and are case sensitive.

  To reference the installation prefix itself with a relative path use ".".

  Currently installed file properties are only defined for
  the WIX generator where the given paths are relative
  to the installation prefix.

``TEST``
  Scope may name zero or more existing tests.

``CACHE``
  Scope must name zero or more cache existing entries.

The required ``PROPERTY`` option is immediately followed by the name of
the property to set.  Remaining arguments are used to compose the
property value in the form of a semicolon-separated list.

If the ``APPEND`` option is given the list is appended to any existing
property value.  If the ``APPEND_STRING`` option is given the string is
appended to any existing property value as string, i.e. it results in a
longer string and not a list of strings.  When using ``APPEND`` or
``APPEND_STRING`` with a property defined to support ``INHERITED``
behavior (see :command:`define_property`), no inheriting occurs when
finding the initial value to append to.  If the property is not already
directly set in the nominated scope, the command will behave as though
``APPEND`` or ``APPEND_STRING`` had not been given.

See the :manual:`cmake-properties(7)` manual for a list of properties
in each scope.
subdirs
-------

Deprecated. Use the :command:`add_subdirectory` command instead.

Add a list of subdirectories to the build.

::

  subdirs(dir1 dir2 ...[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL exclude_dir1 exclude_dir2 ...]
          [PREORDER] )

Add a list of subdirectories to the build.  The :command:`add_subdirectory`
command should be used instead of ``subdirs`` although ``subdirs`` will still
work.  This will cause any CMakeLists.txt files in the sub directories
to be processed by CMake.  Any directories after the ``PREORDER`` flag are
traversed first by makefile builds, the ``PREORDER`` flag has no effect on
IDE projects.  Any directories after the ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` marker will
not be included in the top level makefile or project file.  This is
useful for having CMake create makefiles or projects for a set of
examples in a project.  You would want CMake to generate makefiles or
project files for all the examples at the same time, but you would not
want them to show up in the top level project or be built each time
make is run from the top.
find_file

.. include:: FIND_XXX.txt
aux_source_directory
--------------------

Find all source files in a directory.

::

  aux_source_directory(<dir> <variable>)

Collects the names of all the source files in the specified directory
and stores the list in the ``<variable>`` provided.  This command is
intended to be used by projects that use explicit template
instantiation.  Template instantiation files can be stored in a
"Templates" subdirectory and collected automatically using this
command to avoid manually listing all instantiations.

It is tempting to use this command to avoid writing the list of source
files for a library or executable target.  While this seems to work,
there is no way for CMake to generate a build system that knows when a
new source file has been added.  Normally the generated build system
knows when it needs to rerun CMake because the CMakeLists.txt file is
modified to add a new source.  When the source is just added to the
directory without modifying this file, one would have to manually
rerun CMake to generate a build system incorporating the new file.
enable_language
---------------

Enable a language (CXX/C/Fortran/etc)

::

  enable_language(<lang> [OPTIONAL] )

This command enables support for the named language in CMake.  This is
the same as the project command but does not create any of the extra
variables that are created by the project command.  Example languages
are ``CXX``, ``C``, ``CUDA``, ``Fortran``, and ``ASM``.

If enabling ``ASM``, enable it last so that CMake can check whether
compilers for other languages like ``C`` work for assembly too.

This command must be called in file scope, not in a function call.
Furthermore, it must be called in the highest directory common to all
targets using the named language directly for compiling sources or
indirectly through link dependencies.  It is simplest to enable all
needed languages in the top-level directory of a project.

The ``OPTIONAL`` keyword is a placeholder for future implementation and
does not currently work. Instead you can use the :module:`CheckLanguage`
module to verify support before enabling.
source_group
------------

Define a grouping for source files in IDE project generation.
There are two different signatures to create source groups.

::

  source_group(<name> [FILES <src>...] [REGULAR_EXPRESSION <regex>])
  source_group(TREE <root> [PREFIX <prefix>] [FILES <src>...])

Defines a group into which sources will be placed in project files.
This is intended to set up file tabs in Visual Studio.
The options are:

``TREE``
 CMake will automatically detect, from ``<src>`` files paths, source groups
 it needs to create, to keep structure of source groups analogically to the
 actual files and directories structure in the project. Paths of ``<src>``
 files will be cut to be relative to ``<root>``.

``PREFIX``
 Source group and files located directly in ``<root>`` path, will be placed
 in ``<prefix>`` source groups.

``FILES``
 Any source file specified explicitly will be placed in group
 ``<name>``.  Relative paths are interpreted with respect to the
 current source directory.

``REGULAR_EXPRESSION``
 Any source file whose name matches the regular expression will
 be placed in group ``<name>``.

If a source file matches multiple groups, the *last* group that
explicitly lists the file with ``FILES`` will be favored, if any.
If no group explicitly lists the file, the *last* group whose
regular expression matches the file will be favored.

The ``<name>`` of the group and ``<prefix>`` argument may contain backslashes
to specify subgroups:

.. code-block:: cmake

  source_group(outer\\inner ...)
  source_group(TREE <root> PREFIX sources\\inc ...)

For backwards compatibility, the short-hand signature

.. code-block:: cmake

  source_group(<name> <regex>)

is equivalent to

.. code-block:: cmake

  source_group(<name> REGULAR_EXPRESSION <regex>)
target_sources
--------------

Add sources to a target.

::

  target_sources(<target>
    <INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [items1...]
    [<INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [items2...] ...])

Specify sources to use when compiling a given target.  The
named ``<target>`` must have been created by a command such as
:command:`add_executable` or :command:`add_library` and must not be an
:ref:`ALIAS target <Alias Targets>`.

The ``INTERFACE``, ``PUBLIC`` and ``PRIVATE`` keywords are required to
specify the scope of the following arguments.  ``PRIVATE`` and ``PUBLIC``
items will populate the :prop_tgt:`SOURCES` property of
``<target>``.  ``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` items will populate the
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_SOURCES` property of ``<target>``.
(:ref:`IMPORTED targets <Imported Targets>` only support ``INTERFACE`` items.)
The following arguments specify sources.  Repeated calls for the same
``<target>`` append items in the order called.

Arguments to ``target_sources`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``. See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
manual for available expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)`
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
get_filename_component
----------------------

Get a specific component of a full filename.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

  get_filename_component(<VAR> <FileName> <COMP> [CACHE])

Set ``<VAR>`` to a component of ``<FileName>``, where ``<COMP>`` is one of:

::

 DIRECTORY = Directory without file name
 NAME      = File name without directory
 EXT       = File name longest extension (.b.c from d/a.b.c)
 NAME_WE   = File name without directory or longest extension
 PATH      = Legacy alias for DIRECTORY (use for CMake <= 2.8.11)

Paths are returned with forward slashes and have no trailing slashes.
The longest file extension is always considered.  If the optional
``CACHE`` argument is specified, the result variable is added to the
cache.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

  get_filename_component(<VAR> <FileName>
                         <COMP> [BASE_DIR <BASE_DIR>]
                         [CACHE])

Set ``<VAR>`` to the absolute path of ``<FileName>``, where ``<COMP>`` is one
of:

::

 ABSOLUTE  = Full path to file
 REALPATH  = Full path to existing file with symlinks resolved

If the provided ``<FileName>`` is a relative path, it is evaluated relative
to the given base directory ``<BASE_DIR>``.  If no base directory is
provided, the default base directory will be
:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`.

Paths are returned with forward slashes and have no trailing slashes.  If the
optional ``CACHE`` argument is specified, the result variable is added to the
cache.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

  get_filename_component(<VAR> <FileName>
                         PROGRAM [PROGRAM_ARGS <ARG_VAR>]
                         [CACHE])

The program in ``<FileName>`` will be found in the system search path or
left as a full path.  If ``PROGRAM_ARGS`` is present with ``PROGRAM``, then
any command-line arguments present in the ``<FileName>`` string are split
from the program name and stored in ``<ARG_VAR>``.  This is used to
separate a program name from its arguments in a command line string.
add_compile_definitions
-----------------------

Adds preprocessor definitions to the compilation of source files.

::

  add_compile_definitions(<definition> ...)

Adds preprocessor definitions to the compiler command line for targets in the
current directory and below that are added after this command is invoked.
See documentation of the :prop_dir:`directory <COMPILE_DEFINITIONS>` and
:prop_tgt:`target <COMPILE_DEFINITIONS>` ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` properties.

Definitions are specified using the syntax ``VAR`` or ``VAR=value``.
Function-style definitions are not supported. CMake will automatically
escape the value correctly for the native build system (note that CMake
language syntax may require escapes to specify some values).

Arguments to ``add_compile_definitions`` may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
manual for available expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)`
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
continue
--------

Continue to the top of enclosing foreach or while loop.

::

  continue()

The ``continue`` command allows a cmake script to abort the rest of a block
in a :command:`foreach` or :command:`while` loop, and start at the top of
the next iteration.  See also the :command:`break` command.
cmake_parse_arguments
---------------------

``cmake_parse_arguments`` is intended to be used in macros or functions for
parsing the arguments given to that macro or function.  It processes the
arguments and defines a set of variables which hold the values of the
respective options.

::

  cmake_parse_arguments(<prefix> <options> <one_value_keywords>
                        <multi_value_keywords> args...)

  cmake_parse_arguments(PARSE_ARGV N <prefix> <options> <one_value_keywords>
                        <multi_value_keywords>)

The first signature reads processes arguments passed in the ``args...``.
This may be used in either a :command:`macro` or a :command:`function`.

The ``PARSE_ARGV`` signature is only for use in a :command:`function`
body.  In this case the arguments that are parsed come from the
``ARGV#`` variables of the calling function.  The parsing starts with
the Nth argument, where ``N`` is an unsigned integer.  This allows for
the values to have special characters like ``;`` in them.

The ``<options>`` argument contains all options for the respective macro,
i.e.  keywords which can be used when calling the macro without any value
following, like e.g.  the ``OPTIONAL`` keyword of the :command:`install`
command.

The ``<one_value_keywords>`` argument contains all keywords for this macro
which are followed by one value, like e.g. ``DESTINATION`` keyword of the
:command:`install` command.

The ``<multi_value_keywords>`` argument contains all keywords for this
macro which can be followed by more than one value, like e.g. the
``TARGETS`` or ``FILES`` keywords of the :command:`install` command.

.. note::

   All keywords shall be unique. I.e. every keyword shall only be specified
   once in either ``<options>``, ``<one_value_keywords>`` or
   ``<multi_value_keywords>``. A warning will be emitted if uniqueness is
   violated.

When done, ``cmake_parse_arguments`` will consider for each of the
keywords listed in ``<options>``, ``<one_value_keywords>`` and
``<multi_value_keywords>`` a variable composed of the given ``<prefix>``
followed by ``"_"`` and the name of the respective keyword.  These
variables will then hold the respective value from the argument list
or be undefined if the associated option could not be found.
For the ``<options>`` keywords, these will always be defined,
to ``TRUE`` or ``FALSE``, whether the option is in the argument list or not.

All remaining arguments are collected in a variable
``<prefix>_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS`` that will be undefined if all argument
where recognized. This can be checked afterwards to see
whether your macro was called with unrecognized parameters.

As an example here a ``my_install()`` macro, which takes similar arguments
as the real :command:`install` command:

.. code-block:: cmake

   macro(my_install)
       set(options OPTIONAL FAST)
       set(oneValueArgs DESTINATION RENAME)
       set(multiValueArgs TARGETS CONFIGURATIONS)
       cmake_parse_arguments(MY_INSTALL "${options}" "${oneValueArgs}"
                             "${multiValueArgs}" ${ARGN} )

       # ...

Assume ``my_install()`` has been called like this:

.. code-block:: cmake

   my_install(TARGETS foo bar DESTINATION bin OPTIONAL blub)

After the ``cmake_parse_arguments`` call the macro will have set or undefined
the following variables::

   MY_INSTALL_OPTIONAL = TRUE
   MY_INSTALL_FAST = FALSE # was not used in call to my_install
   MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION = "bin"
   MY_INSTALL_RENAME <UNDEFINED> # was not used
   MY_INSTALL_TARGETS = "foo;bar"
   MY_INSTALL_CONFIGURATIONS <UNDEFINED> # was not used
   MY_INSTALL_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS = "blub" # nothing expected after "OPTIONAL"

You can then continue and process these variables.

Keywords terminate lists of values, e.g.  if directly after a
one_value_keyword another recognized keyword follows, this is
interpreted as the beginning of the new option.  E.g.
``my_install(TARGETS foo DESTINATION OPTIONAL)`` would result in
``MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION`` set to ``"OPTIONAL"``, but as ``OPTIONAL``
is a keyword itself ``MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION`` will be empty and
``MY_INSTALL_OPTIONAL`` will therefore be set to ``TRUE``.
load_cache
----------

Load in the values from another project's CMake cache.

::

  load_cache(pathToCacheFile READ_WITH_PREFIX
             prefix entry1...)

Read the cache and store the requested entries in variables with their
name prefixed with the given prefix.  This only reads the values, and
does not create entries in the local project's cache.

::

  load_cache(pathToCacheFile [EXCLUDE entry1...]
             [INCLUDE_INTERNALS entry1...])

Load in the values from another cache and store them in the local
project's cache as internal entries.  This is useful for a project
that depends on another project built in a different tree.  ``EXCLUDE``
option can be used to provide a list of entries to be excluded.
``INCLUDE_INTERNALS`` can be used to provide a list of internal entries to
be included.  Normally, no internal entries are brought in.  Use of
this form of the command is strongly discouraged, but it is provided
for backward compatibility.
make_directory
--------------

Deprecated. Use the :command:`file(MAKE_DIRECTORY)` command instead.

::

  make_directory(directory)

Creates the specified directory.  Full paths should be given.  Any
parent directories that do not exist will also be created.  Use with
care.
ctest_submit
------------

Perform the :ref:`CTest Submit Step` as a :ref:`Dashboard Client`.

::

  ctest_submit([PARTS <part>...] [FILES <file>...]
               [HTTPHEADER <header>]
               [RETRY_COUNT <count>]
               [RETRY_DELAY <delay>]
               [RETURN_VALUE <result-var>]
               [QUIET]
               )

Submit results to a dashboard server.
By default all available parts are submitted.

The options are:

``PARTS <part>...``
  Specify a subset of parts to submit.  Valid part names are::

    Start      = nothing
    Update     = ctest_update results, in Update.xml
    Configure  = ctest_configure results, in Configure.xml
    Build      = ctest_build results, in Build.xml
    Test       = ctest_test results, in Test.xml
    Coverage   = ctest_coverage results, in Coverage.xml
    MemCheck   = ctest_memcheck results, in DynamicAnalysis.xml
    Notes      = Files listed by CTEST_NOTES_FILES, in Notes.xml
    ExtraFiles = Files listed by CTEST_EXTRA_SUBMIT_FILES
    Upload     = Files prepared for upload by ctest_upload(), in Upload.xml
    Submit     = nothing

``FILES <file>...``
  Specify an explicit list of specific files to be submitted.
  Each individual file must exist at the time of the call.

``HTTPHEADER <HTTP-header>``
  Specify HTTP header to be included in the request to CDash during submission.
  This suboption can be repeated several times.

``RETRY_COUNT <count>``
  Specify how many times to retry a timed-out submission.

``RETRY_DELAY <delay>``
  Specify how long (in seconds) to wait after a timed-out submission
  before attempting to re-submit.

``RETURN_VALUE <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable ``0`` for success and
  non-zero on failure.

``QUIET``
  Suppress all non-error messages that would have otherwise been
  printed to the console.

Submit to CDash Upload API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  ctest_submit(CDASH_UPLOAD <file> [CDASH_UPLOAD_TYPE <type>]
               [HTTPHEADER <header>]
               [RETRY_COUNT <count>]
               [RETRY_DELAY <delay>]
               [QUIET])

This second signature is used to upload files to CDash via the CDash
file upload API. The API first sends a request to upload to CDash along
with a content hash of the file. If CDash does not already have the file,
then it is uploaded. Along with the file, a CDash type string is specified
to tell CDash which handler to use to process the data.

This signature accepts the ``HTTPHEADER``, ``RETRY_COUNT``, ``RETRY_DELAY``, and
``QUIET`` options as described above.
try_compile
-----------

.. only:: html

   .. contents::

Try building some code.

Try Compiling Whole Projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  try_compile(RESULT_VAR <bindir> <srcdir>
              <projectName> [<targetName>] [CMAKE_FLAGS <flags>...]
              [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>])

Try building a project.  The success or failure of the ``try_compile``,
i.e. ``TRUE`` or ``FALSE`` respectively, is returned in ``RESULT_VAR``.

In this form, ``<srcdir>`` should contain a complete CMake project with a
``CMakeLists.txt`` file and all sources.  The ``<bindir>`` and ``<srcdir>``
will not be deleted after this command is run.  Specify ``<targetName>`` to
build a specific target instead of the ``all`` or ``ALL_BUILD`` target.  See
below for the meaning of other options.

Try Compiling Source Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  try_compile(RESULT_VAR <bindir> <srcfile|SOURCES srcfile...>
              [CMAKE_FLAGS <flags>...]
              [COMPILE_DEFINITIONS <defs>...]
              [LINK_LIBRARIES <libs>...]
              [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>]
              [COPY_FILE <fileName> [COPY_FILE_ERROR <var>]]
              [<LANG>_STANDARD <std>]
              [<LANG>_STANDARD_REQUIRED <bool>]
              [<LANG>_EXTENSIONS <bool>]
              )

Try building an executable from one or more source files.  The success or
failure of the ``try_compile``, i.e. ``TRUE`` or ``FALSE`` respectively, is
returned in ``RESULT_VAR``.

In this form the user need only supply one or more source files that include a
definition for ``main``.  CMake will create a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file to build
the source(s) as an executable that looks something like this::

  add_definitions(<expanded COMPILE_DEFINITIONS from caller>)
  include_directories(${INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES})
  link_directories(${LINK_DIRECTORIES})
  add_executable(cmTryCompileExec <srcfile>...)
  target_link_libraries(cmTryCompileExec ${LINK_LIBRARIES})

The options are:

``CMAKE_FLAGS <flags>...``
  Specify flags of the form ``-DVAR:TYPE=VALUE`` to be passed to
  the ``cmake`` command-line used to drive the test build.
  The above example shows how values for variables
  ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, ``LINK_DIRECTORIES``, and ``LINK_LIBRARIES``
  are used.

``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS <defs>...``
  Specify ``-Ddefinition`` arguments to pass to ``add_definitions``
  in the generated test project.

``COPY_FILE <fileName>``
  Copy the linked executable to the given ``<fileName>``.

``COPY_FILE_ERROR <var>``
  Use after ``COPY_FILE`` to capture into variable ``<var>`` any error
  message encountered while trying to copy the file.

``LINK_LIBRARIES <libs>...``
  Specify libraries to be linked in the generated project.
  The list of libraries may refer to system libraries and to
  :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` from the calling project.

  If this option is specified, any ``-DLINK_LIBRARIES=...`` value
  given to the ``CMAKE_FLAGS`` option will be ignored.

``OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>``
  Store the output from the build process the given variable.

``<LANG>_STANDARD <std>``
  Specify the :prop_tgt:`C_STANDARD`, :prop_tgt:`CXX_STANDARD`,
  or :prop_tgt:`CUDA_STANDARD` target property of the generated project.

``<LANG>_STANDARD_REQUIRED <bool>``
  Specify the :prop_tgt:`C_STANDARD_REQUIRED`,
  :prop_tgt:`CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED`, or :prop_tgt:`CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED`
  target property of the generated project.

``<LANG>_EXTENSIONS <bool>``
  Specify the :prop_tgt:`C_EXTENSIONS`, :prop_tgt:`CXX_EXTENSIONS`,
  or :prop_tgt:`CUDA_EXTENSIONS` target property of the generated project.

In this version all files in ``<bindir>/CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp`` will be
cleaned automatically.  For debugging, ``--debug-trycompile`` can be
passed to ``cmake`` to avoid this clean.  However, multiple sequential
``try_compile`` operations reuse this single output directory.  If you use
``--debug-trycompile``, you can only debug one ``try_compile`` call at a time.
The recommended procedure is to protect all ``try_compile`` calls in your
project by ``if(NOT DEFINED RESULT_VAR)`` logic, configure with cmake
all the way through once, then delete the cache entry associated with
the try_compile call of interest, and then re-run cmake again with
``--debug-trycompile``.

Other Behavior Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If set, the following variables are passed in to the generated
try_compile CMakeLists.txt to initialize compile target properties with
default values:

* :variable:`CMAKE_ENABLE_EXPORTS`
* :variable:`CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC`
* :variable:`CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC`
* :variable:`CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`

If :policy:`CMP0056` is set to ``NEW``, then
:variable:`CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS` is passed in as well.

The current setting of :policy:`CMP0065` is set in the generated project.

Set the :variable:`CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION` variable to choose
a build configuration.

Set the :variable:`CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE` variable to specify
the type of target used for the source file signature.

Set the :variable:`CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_PLATFORM_VARIABLES` variable to specify
variables that must be propagated into the test project.  This variable is
meant for use only in toolchain files.

If :policy:`CMP0067` is set to ``NEW``, or any of the ``<LANG>_STANDARD``,
``<LANG>_STANDARD_REQUIRED``, or ``<LANG>_EXTENSIONS`` options are used,
then the language standard variables are honored:

* :variable:`CMAKE_C_STANDARD`
* :variable:`CMAKE_C_STANDARD_REQUIRED`
* :variable:`CMAKE_C_EXTENSIONS`
* :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD`
* :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED`
* :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS`
* :variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD`
* :variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED`
* :variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_EXTENSIONS`

Their values are used to set the corresponding target properties in
the generated project (unless overridden by an explicit option).
remove
------

Deprecated. Use the :command:`list(REMOVE_ITEM)` command instead.

::

  remove(VAR VALUE VALUE ...)

Removes ``VALUE`` from the variable ``VAR``.  This is typically used to
remove entries from a vector (e.g.  semicolon separated list).  ``VALUE``
is expanded.
string
------

String operations.

Search and Replace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _FIND:

::

  string(FIND <string> <substring> <output variable> [REVERSE])

Return the position where the given substring was found in
the supplied string.  If the ``REVERSE`` flag was used, the command will
search for the position of the last occurrence of the specified
substring.  If the substring is not found, a position of -1 is returned.

.. _REPLACE:

::

  string(REPLACE <match_string>
         <replace_string> <output variable>
         <input> [<input>...])

Replace all occurrences of ``match_string`` in the input
with ``replace_string`` and store the result in the output.

Regular Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _`REGEX MATCH`:

::

  string(REGEX MATCH <regular_expression>
         <output variable> <input> [<input>...])

Match the regular expression once and store the match in the output variable.
All ``<input>`` arguments are concatenated before matching.

.. _`REGEX MATCHALL`:

::

  string(REGEX MATCHALL <regular_expression>
         <output variable> <input> [<input>...])

Match the regular expression as many times as possible and store the matches
in the output variable as a list.
All ``<input>`` arguments are concatenated before matching.

.. _`REGEX REPLACE`:

::

  string(REGEX REPLACE <regular_expression>
         <replace_expression> <output variable>
         <input> [<input>...])

Match the regular expression as many times as possible and substitute the
replacement expression for the match in the output.
All ``<input>`` arguments are concatenated before matching.

The replace expression may refer to paren-delimited subexpressions of the
match using ``\1``, ``\2``, ..., ``\9``.  Note that two backslashes (``\\1``)
are required in CMake code to get a backslash through argument parsing.

.. _`Regex Specification`:

Regex Specification
"""""""""""""""""""

The following characters have special meaning in regular expressions:

``^``
  Matches at beginning of input
``$``
  Matches at end of input
``.``
  Matches any single character
``[ ]``
  Matches any character(s) inside the brackets
``[^ ]``
  Matches any character(s) not inside the brackets
``-``
  Inside brackets, specifies an inclusive range between
  characters on either side e.g. ``[a-f]`` is ``[abcdef]``
  To match a literal ``-`` using brackets, make it the first
  or the last character e.g. ``[+*/-]`` matches basic
  mathematical operators.
``*``
  Matches preceding pattern zero or more times
``+``
  Matches preceding pattern one or more times
``?``
  Matches preceding pattern zero or once only
``|``
  Matches a pattern on either side of the ``|``
``()``
  Saves a matched subexpression, which can be referenced
  in the ``REGEX REPLACE`` operation. Additionally it is saved
  by all regular expression-related commands, including
  e.g. :command:`if(MATCHES)`, in the variables
  :variable:`CMAKE_MATCH_<n>` for ``<n>`` 0..9.

``*``, ``+`` and ``?`` have higher precedence than concatenation.  ``|``
has lower precedence than concatenation.  This means that the regular
expression ``^ab+d$`` matches ``abbd`` but not ``ababd``, and the regular
expression ``^(ab|cd)$`` matches ``ab`` but not ``abd``.

Manipulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _APPEND:

::

  string(APPEND <string variable> [<input>...])

Append all the input arguments to the string.

.. _PREPEND:

::

  string(PREPEND <string variable> [<input>...])

.. _CONCAT:

::

  string(CONCAT <output variable> [<input>...])

Concatenate all the input arguments together and store
the result in the named output variable.

.. _JOIN:

::

  string(JOIN <glue> <output variable> [<input>...])

Join all the input arguments together using the glue
string and store the result in the named output variable.

To join list's elements, use preferably the ``JOIN`` operator
from :command:`list` command. This allows for the elements to have
special characters like ``;`` in them.

.. _TOLOWER:

::

  string(TOLOWER <string1> <output variable>)

Convert string to lower characters.

.. _TOUPPER:

::

  string(TOUPPER <string1> <output variable>)

Store in an output variable a given string's length.

.. _SUBSTRING:

::

  string(SUBSTRING <string> <begin> <length> <output variable>)

Store in an output variable a substring of a given string.  If length is
``-1`` the remainder of the string starting at begin will be returned.
If string is shorter than length then end of string is used instead.

.. note::
  CMake 3.1 and below reported an error if length pointed past
  the end of string.

.. _STRIP:

::

  string(STRIP <string> <output variable>)

Store in an output variable a substring of a given string with leading and
trailing spaces removed.

.. _GENEX_STRIP:

::

  string(GENEX_STRIP <input string> <output variable>)

Strip any :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
from the ``input string`` and store the result in the ``output variable``.

Comparison
^^^^^^^^^^

.. _COMPARE:

::

  string(COMPARE LESS <string1> <string2> <output variable>)
  string(COMPARE GREATER <string1> <string2> <output variable>)
  string(COMPARE EQUAL <string1> <string2> <output variable>)
  string(COMPARE NOTEQUAL <string1> <string2> <output variable>)
  string(COMPARE LESS_EQUAL <string1> <string2> <output variable>)
  string(COMPARE GREATER_EQUAL <string1> <string2> <output variable>)

Compare the strings and store true or false in the output variable.

.. _`Supported Hash Algorithms`:

Hashing
^^^^^^^

.. _`HASH`:

::

  string(<HASH> <output variable> <input>)

Compute a cryptographic hash of the input string.
The supported ``<HASH>`` algorithm names are:

``MD5``
  Message-Digest Algorithm 5, RFC 1321.
``SHA1``
  US Secure Hash Algorithm 1, RFC 3174.
``SHA224``

Generation
^^^^^^^^^^

.. _ASCII:

::

  string(ASCII <number> [<number> ...] <output variable>)

Convert all numbers into corresponding ASCII characters.

.. _CONFIGURE:

::

  string(CONFIGURE <string1> <output variable>
         [@ONLY] [ESCAPE_QUOTES])

Transform a string like :command:`configure_file` transforms a file.

.. _MAKE_C_IDENTIFIER:

::

  string(MAKE_C_IDENTIFIER <input string> <output variable>)

Convert each non-alphanumeric character in the ``<input string>`` to an
underscore and store the result in the ``<output variable>``.  If the first
character of the string is a digit, an underscore will also be prepended to
the result.

.. _RANDOM:

::

  string(RANDOM [LENGTH <length>] [ALPHABET <alphabet>]
         [RANDOM_SEED <seed>] <output variable>)

Return a random string of given length consisting of
characters from the given alphabet.  Default length is 5 characters
and default alphabet is all numbers and upper and lower case letters.
If an integer ``RANDOM_SEED`` is given, its value will be used to seed the
random number generator.

.. _TIMESTAMP:

::

  string(TIMESTAMP <output variable> [<format string>] [UTC])

Write a string representation of the current date
and/or time to the output variable.

Should the command be unable to obtain a timestamp the output variable
will be set to the empty string "".

The optional ``UTC`` flag requests the current date/time representation to
be in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than local time.

The optional ``<format string>`` may contain the following format
specifiers:

::

   %%        A literal percent sign (%).
   %d        The day of the current month (01-31).
   %H        The hour on a 24-hour clock (00-23).
   %I        The hour on a 12-hour clock (01-12).
   %j        The day of the current year (001-366).
   %m        The month of the current year (01-12).
   %b        Abbreviated month name (e.g. Oct).
   %B        Full month name (e.g. October).
   %M        The minute of the current hour (00-59).
   %s        Seconds since midnight (UTC) 1-Jan-1970 (UNIX time).
   %S        The second of the current minute.
             60 represents a leap second. (00-60)
   %U        The week number of the current year (00-53).
   %w        The day of the current week. 0 is Sunday. (0-6)
   %a        Abbreviated weekday name (e.g. Fri).
   %A        Full weekday name (e.g. Friday).
   %y        The last two digits of the current year (00-99)
   %Y        The current year.

Unknown format specifiers will be ignored and copied to the output
as-is.

If no explicit ``<format string>`` is given it will default to:

::

   %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S    for local time.
   %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ   for UTC.

.. note::

  If the ``SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`` environment variable is set,
  its value will be used instead of the current time.
  See https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/ for details.

.. _UUID:

::

  string(UUID <output variable> NAMESPACE <namespace> NAME <name>
         TYPE <MD5|SHA1> [UPPER])

Create a universally unique identifier (aka GUID) as per RFC4122
based on the hash of the combined values of ``<namespace>``
(which itself has to be a valid UUID) and ``<name>``.
The hash algorithm can be either ``MD5`` (Version 3 UUID) or
``SHA1`` (Version 5 UUID).
A UUID has the format ``xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx``
where each `x` represents a lower case hexadecimal character.
Where required an uppercase representation can be requested
with the optional ``UPPER`` flag.
message
-------

Display a message to the user.

::

  message([<mode>] "message to display" ...)

The optional ``<mode>`` keyword determines the type of message:

::

  (none)         = Important information
  STATUS         = Incidental information
  WARNING        = CMake Warning, continue processing
  AUTHOR_WARNING = CMake Warning (dev), continue processing
  SEND_ERROR     = CMake Error, continue processing,
                                but skip generation
  FATAL_ERROR    = CMake Error, stop processing and generation
  DEPRECATION    = CMake Deprecation Error or Warning if variable
                   CMAKE_ERROR_DEPRECATED or CMAKE_WARN_DEPRECATED
                   is enabled, respectively, else no message.

The CMake command-line tool displays STATUS messages on stdout and all
other message types on stderr.  The CMake GUI displays all messages in
its log area.  The interactive dialogs (ccmake and CMakeSetup) show
STATUS messages one at a time on a status line and other messages in
interactive pop-up boxes.

CMake Warning and Error message text displays using a simple markup
language.  Non-indented text is formatted in line-wrapped paragraphs
delimited by newlines.  Indented text is considered pre-formatted.
load_command
------------

Disallowed.  See CMake Policy :policy:`CMP0031`.

Load a command into a running CMake.

::

  load_command(COMMAND_NAME <loc1> [loc2 ...])

The given locations are searched for a library whose name is
cmCOMMAND_NAME.  If found, it is loaded as a module and the command is
added to the set of available CMake commands.  Usually,
:command:`try_compile` is used before this command to compile the
module.  If the command is successfully loaded a variable named

::

  CMAKE_LOADED_COMMAND_<COMMAND_NAME>

will be set to the full path of the module that was loaded.  Otherwise
the variable will not be set.
cmake_policy
------------

Manage CMake Policy settings.  See the :manual:`cmake-policies(7)`
manual for defined policies.

As CMake evolves it is sometimes necessary to change existing behavior
in order to fix bugs or improve implementations of existing features.
The CMake Policy mechanism is designed to help keep existing projects
building as new versions of CMake introduce changes in behavior.  Each
new policy (behavioral change) is given an identifier of the form
``CMP<NNNN>`` where ``<NNNN>`` is an integer index.  Documentation
associated with each policy describes the ``OLD`` and ``NEW`` behavior
and the reason the policy was introduced.  Projects may set each policy
to select the desired behavior.  When CMake needs to know which behavior
to use it checks for a setting specified by the project.  If no
setting is available the ``OLD`` behavior is assumed and a warning is
produced requesting that the policy be set.

Setting Policies by CMake Version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``cmake_policy`` command is used to set policies to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
behavior.  While setting policies individually is supported, we
encourage projects to set policies based on CMake versions::

  cmake_policy(VERSION <min>[...<max>])

``<min>`` and the optional ``<max>`` are each CMake versions of the form
``major.minor[.patch[.tweak]]``, and the ``...`` is literal.  The ``<min>``
version must be at least ``2.4`` and at most the running version of CMake.
The ``<max>`` version, if specified, must be at least the ``<min>`` version
but may exceed the running version of CMake.

This specifies that the current CMake code is written for the given
range of CMake versions.  All policies known to the running version of CMake
and introduced in the ``<min>`` (or ``<max>``, if specified) version
or earlier will be set to use ``NEW`` behavior.  All policies
introduced in later versions will be unset (unless the
:variable:`CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>` variable sets a default).
This effectively requests behavior preferred as of a given CMake
version and tells newer CMake versions to warn about their new policies.

Note that the :command:`cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)`
command implicitly calls ``cmake_policy(VERSION)`` too.

Setting Policies Explicitly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  cmake_policy(SET CMP<NNNN> NEW)
  cmake_policy(SET CMP<NNNN> OLD)

Tell CMake to use the ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` behavior for a given policy.
Projects depending on the old behavior of a given policy may silence a
policy warning by setting the policy state to ``OLD``.  Alternatively
one may fix the project to work with the new behavior and set the
policy state to ``NEW``.

.. include:: ../policy/DEPRECATED.txt

Checking Policy Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  cmake_policy(GET CMP<NNNN> <variable>)

Check whether a given policy is set to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` behavior.
The output ``<variable>`` value will be ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` if the
policy is set, and empty otherwise.

CMake Policy Stack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CMake keeps policy settings on a stack, so changes made by the
cmake_policy command affect only the top of the stack.  A new entry on
the policy stack is managed automatically for each subdirectory to
protect its parents and siblings.  CMake also manages a new entry for
scripts loaded by :command:`include` and :command:`find_package` commands
except when invoked with the ``NO_POLICY_SCOPE`` option
(see also policy :policy:`CMP0011`).
The ``cmake_policy`` command provides an interface to manage custom
entries on the policy stack::

  cmake_policy(PUSH)
  cmake_policy(POP)

Each ``PUSH`` must have a matching ``POP`` to erase any changes.
This is useful to make temporary changes to policy settings.
Calls to the :command:`cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)`,
``cmake_policy(VERSION)``, or ``cmake_policy(SET)`` commands
influence only the current top of the policy stack.

Commands created by the :command:`function` and :command:`macro`
commands record policy settings when they are created and
use the pre-record policies when they are invoked.  If the function or
macro implementation sets policies, the changes automatically
propagate up through callers until they reach the closest nested
policy stack entry.
variable_watch
--------------

Watch the CMake variable for change.

::

  variable_watch(<variable name> [<command to execute>])

If the specified variable changes, the message will be printed about
the variable being changed.  If the command is specified, the command
will be executed.  The command will receive the following arguments:
COMMAND(<variable> <access> <value> <current list file> <stack>)
find_package
------------

Load settings for an external project.

::

  find_package(<package> [version] [EXACT] [QUIET] [MODULE]
               [REQUIRED] [[COMPONENTS] [components...]]
               [OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS components...]
               [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])

Finds and loads settings from an external project.  ``<package>_FOUND``
will be set to indicate whether the package was found.  When the
package is found package-specific information is provided through
variables and :ref:`Imported Targets` documented by the package itself.  The
``QUIET`` option disables messages if the package cannot be found.  The
``MODULE`` option disables the second signature documented below.  The
``REQUIRED`` option stops processing with an error message if the package
cannot be found.

A package-specific list of required components may be listed after the
``COMPONENTS`` option (or after the ``REQUIRED`` option if present).
Additional optional components may be listed after
``OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS``.  Available components and their influence on
whether a package is considered to be found are defined by the target
package.

The ``[version]`` argument requests a version with which the package found
should be compatible (format is ``major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]``).  The
``EXACT`` option requests that the version be matched exactly.  If no
``[version]`` and/or component list is given to a recursive invocation
inside a find-module, the corresponding arguments are forwarded
automatically from the outer call (including the ``EXACT`` flag for
``[version]``).  Version support is currently provided only on a
package-by-package basis (details below).

User code should generally look for packages using the above simple
signature.  The remainder of this command documentation specifies the
full command signature and details of the search process.  Project
maintainers wishing to provide a package to be found by this command
are encouraged to read on.

The command has two modes by which it searches for packages: "Module"
mode and "Config" mode.  Module mode is available when the command is
invoked with the above reduced signature.  CMake searches for a file
called ``Find<package>.cmake`` in the :variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`
followed by the CMake installation.  If the file is found, it is read
and processed by CMake.  It is responsible for finding the package,
checking the version, and producing any needed messages.  Many
find-modules provide limited or no support for versioning; check
the module documentation.  If no module is found and the ``MODULE``
option is not given the command proceeds to Config mode.

The complete Config mode command signature is::

  find_package(<package> [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]
               [REQUIRED] [[COMPONENTS] [components...]]
               [CONFIG|NO_MODULE]
               [NO_POLICY_SCOPE]
               [NAMES name1 [name2 ...]]
               [CONFIGS config1 [config2 ...]]
               [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ]]
               [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ]]
               [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
               [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
               [NO_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH]
               [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
               [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
               [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
               [NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY]
               [NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH] # Deprecated; does nothing.
               [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
               [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY]
               [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH])

The ``CONFIG`` option may be used to skip Module mode explicitly and
switch to Config mode.  It is synonymous to using ``NO_MODULE``.  Config
mode is also implied by use of options not specified in the reduced
signature.

Config mode attempts to locate a configuration file provided by the
package to be found.  A cache entry called ``<package>_DIR`` is created to
hold the directory containing the file.  By default the command
searches for a package with the name ``<package>``.  If the ``NAMES`` option
is given the names following it are used instead of ``<package>``.  The
command searches for a file called ``<name>Config.cmake`` or
``<lower-case-name>-config.cmake`` for each name specified.  A
replacement set of possible configuration file names may be given
using the ``CONFIGS`` option.  The search procedure is specified below.
Once found, the configuration file is read and processed by CMake.
Since the file is provided by the package it already knows the
location of package contents.  The full path to the configuration file
is stored in the cmake variable ``<package>_CONFIG``.

All configuration files which have been considered by CMake while
searching for an installation of the package with an appropriate
version are stored in the cmake variable ``<package>_CONSIDERED_CONFIGS``,
the associated versions in ``<package>_CONSIDERED_VERSIONS``.

If the package configuration file cannot be found CMake will generate
an error describing the problem unless the ``QUIET`` argument is
specified.  If ``REQUIRED`` is specified and the package is not found a
fatal error is generated and the configure step stops executing.  If
``<package>_DIR`` has been set to a directory not containing a
configuration file CMake will ignore it and search from scratch.

When the ``[version]`` argument is given Config mode will only find a
version of the package that claims compatibility with the requested
version (format is ``major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]``).  If the ``EXACT``
option is given only a version of the package claiming an exact match
of the requested version may be found.  CMake does not establish any
convention for the meaning of version numbers.  Package version
numbers are checked by "version" files provided by the packages
themselves.  For a candidate package configuration file
``<config-file>.cmake`` the corresponding version file is located next
to it and named either ``<config-file>-version.cmake`` or
``<config-file>Version.cmake``.  If no such version file is available
then the configuration file is assumed to not be compatible with any
requested version.  A basic version file containing generic version
matching code can be created using the
:module:`CMakePackageConfigHelpers` module.  When a version file
is found it is loaded to check the requested version number.  The
version file is loaded in a nested scope in which the following
variables have been defined:

``PACKAGE_FIND_NAME``
  the ``<package>`` name
``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION``
  full requested version string
``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR``
  major version if requested, else 0
``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR``
  minor version if requested, else 0
``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH``
  patch version if requested, else 0
``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK``
  tweak version if requested, else 0
``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COUNT``
  number of version components, 0 to 4

The version file checks whether it satisfies the requested version and
sets these variables:

``PACKAGE_VERSION``
  full provided version string
``PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT``
  true if version is exact match
``PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE``
  true if version is compatible
``PACKAGE_VERSION_UNSUITABLE``
  true if unsuitable as any version

These variables are checked by the ``find_package`` command to determine
whether the configuration file provides an acceptable version.  They
are not available after the find_package call returns.  If the version
is acceptable the following variables are set:

``<package>_VERSION``
  full provided version string
``<package>_VERSION_MAJOR``
  major version if provided, else 0
``<package>_VERSION_MINOR``
  minor version if provided, else 0
``<package>_VERSION_PATCH``
  patch version if provided, else 0
``<package>_VERSION_TWEAK``
  tweak version if provided, else 0
``<package>_VERSION_COUNT``
  number of version components, 0 to 4

and the corresponding package configuration file is loaded.
When multiple package configuration files are available whose version files
claim compatibility with the version requested it is unspecified which
one is chosen: unless the variable :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER`
is set no attempt is made to choose a highest or closest version number.

To control the order in which ``find_package`` checks for compatibility use
the two variables :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER` and
:variable:`CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_DIRECTION`.
For instance in order to select the highest version one can set::

  SET(CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER NATURAL)
  SET(CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_DIRECTION DEC)

before calling ``find_package``.

Config mode provides an elaborate interface and search procedure.
Much of the interface is provided for completeness and for use
internally by find-modules loaded by Module mode.  Most user code
should simply call::

  find_package(<package> [major[.minor]] [EXACT] [REQUIRED|QUIET])

in order to find a package.  Package maintainers providing CMake
package configuration files are encouraged to name and install them
such that the procedure outlined below will find them without
requiring use of additional options.

CMake constructs a set of possible installation prefixes for the
package.  Under each prefix several directories are searched for a
configuration file.  The tables below show the directories searched.
Each entry is meant for installation trees following Windows (W), UNIX
(U), or Apple (A) conventions::

  <prefix>/                                                       (W)
  <prefix>/(cmake|CMake)/                                         (W)
  <prefix>/<name>*/                                               (W)
  <prefix>/<name>*/(cmake|CMake)/                                 (W)
  <prefix>/(lib/<arch>|lib*|share)/cmake/<name>*/                 (U)
  <prefix>/(lib/<arch>|lib*|share)/<name>*/                       (U)
  <prefix>/(lib/<arch>|lib*|share)/<name>*/(cmake|CMake)/         (U)
  <prefix>/<name>*/(lib/<arch>|lib*|share)/cmake/<name>*/         (W/U)
  <prefix>/<name>*/(lib/<arch>|lib*|share)/<name>*/               (W/U)
  <prefix>/<name>*/(lib/<arch>|lib*|share)/<name>*/(cmake|CMake)/ (W/U)

On systems supporting OS X Frameworks and Application Bundles the
following directories are searched for frameworks or bundles
containing a configuration file::

  <prefix>/<name>.framework/Resources/                    (A)
  <prefix>/<name>.framework/Resources/CMake/              (A)
  <prefix>/<name>.framework/Versions/*/Resources/         (A)
  <prefix>/<name>.framework/Versions/*/Resources/CMake/   (A)
  <prefix>/<name>.app/Contents/Resources/                 (A)
  <prefix>/<name>.app/Contents/Resources/CMake/           (A)

In all cases the ``<name>`` is treated as case-insensitive and corresponds
to any of the names specified (``<package>`` or names given by ``NAMES``).

Paths with ``lib/<arch>`` are enabled if the
:variable:`CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE` variable is set. ``lib*`` includes one
or more of the values ``lib64``, ``lib32``, ``libx32`` or ``lib`` (searched in
that order).

* Paths with ``lib64`` are searched on 64 bit platforms if the
  :prop_gbl:`FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS` property is set to ``TRUE``.
* Paths with ``lib32`` are searched on 32 bit platforms if the
  :prop_gbl:`FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS` property is set to ``TRUE``.
* Paths with ``libx32`` are searched on platforms using the x32 ABI
  if the :prop_gbl:`FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS` property is set to ``TRUE``.
* The ``lib`` path is always searched.

If ``PATH_SUFFIXES`` is specified, the suffixes are appended to each
(W) or (U) directory entry one-by-one.

This set of directories is intended to work in cooperation with
projects that provide configuration files in their installation trees.
Directories above marked with (W) are intended for installations on
Windows where the prefix may point at the top of an application's
installation directory.  Those marked with (U) are intended for
installations on UNIX platforms where the prefix is shared by multiple
packages.  This is merely a convention, so all (W) and (U) directories
are still searched on all platforms.  Directories marked with (A) are
intended for installations on Apple platforms.  The
:variable:`CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK` and :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE`
variables determine the order of preference.

The set of installation prefixes is constructed using the following
steps.  If ``NO_DEFAULT_PATH`` is specified all ``NO_*`` options are
enabled.

1. Search paths specified in the ``PackageName_ROOT`` CMake and environment
   variables.  The package root variables are maintained as a stack so if
   called from within a find module, root paths from the parent's find
   module will also be searched after paths for the current package.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH`` is passed.
   See policy :policy:`CMP0074`.

2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables.  These
   are intended to be used on the command line with a ``-DVAR=value``.
   The values are interpreted as :ref:`;-lists <CMake Language Lists>`.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_PATH`` is passed::

     CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
     CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
     CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

3. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
   These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration,
   and therefore use the host's native path separator
   (``;`` on Windows and ``:`` on UNIX).
   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` is passed::

     <package>_DIR
     CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
     CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
     CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

4. Search paths specified by the ``HINTS`` option.  These should be paths
   computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided by the
   location of another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses should
   be specified with the ``PATHS`` option.

5. Search the standard system environment variables.  This can be
   skipped if ``NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` is passed.  Path entries
   ending in ``/bin`` or ``/sbin`` are automatically converted to their
   parent directories::

     PATH

6. Search paths stored in the CMake :ref:`User Package Registry`.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` is passed or by
   setting the :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`
   to ``TRUE``.
   See the :manual:`cmake-packages(7)` manual for details on the user
   package registry.

7. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files for the
   current system.  This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH`` is
   passed::

     CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
     CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH
     CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH

8. Search paths stored in the CMake :ref:`System Package Registry`.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` is passed
   or by setting the
   :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY` to ``TRUE``.
   See the :manual:`cmake-packages(7)` manual for details on the system
   package registry.

9. Search paths specified by the ``PATHS`` option.  These are typically
   hard-coded guesses.

.. |FIND_XXX| replace:: find_package
.. |FIND_ARGS_XXX| replace:: <package>
.. |CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_XXX| replace::
   :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE`

.. include:: FIND_XXX_ROOT.txt
.. include:: FIND_XXX_ORDER.txt

Every non-REQUIRED ``find_package`` call can be disabled by setting the
:variable:`CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>` variable to ``TRUE``.

When loading a find module or package configuration file ``find_package``
defines variables to provide information about the call arguments (and
restores their original state before returning):

``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME``
  the ``<package>`` name which is searched for
``<package>_FIND_REQUIRED``
  true if ``REQUIRED`` option was given
``<package>_FIND_QUIETLY``
  true if ``QUIET`` option was given
``<package>_FIND_VERSION``
  full requested version string
``<package>_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR``
  major version if requested, else 0
``<package>_FIND_VERSION_MINOR``
  minor version if requested, else 0
``<package>_FIND_VERSION_PATCH``
  patch version if requested, else 0
``<package>_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK``
  tweak version if requested, else 0
``<package>_FIND_VERSION_COUNT``
  number of version components, 0 to 4
``<package>_FIND_VERSION_EXACT``
  true if ``EXACT`` option was given
``<package>_FIND_COMPONENTS``
  list of requested components
``<package>_FIND_REQUIRED_<c>``
  true if component ``<c>`` is required,
  false if component ``<c>`` is optional

In Module mode the loaded find module is responsible to honor the
request detailed by these variables; see the find module for details.
In Config mode ``find_package`` handles ``REQUIRED``, ``QUIET``, and
``[version]`` options automatically but leaves it to the package
configuration file to handle components in a way that makes sense
for the package.  The package configuration file may set
``<package>_FOUND`` to false to tell ``find_package`` that component
requirements are not satisfied.

See the :command:`cmake_policy` command documentation for discussion
of the ``NO_POLICY_SCOPE`` option.

install
-------

Specify rules to run at install time.

Synopsis
^^^^^^^^

.. parsed-literal::

  install(`TARGETS`_ <target>... [...])
  install({`FILES`_ | `PROGRAMS`_} <file>... DESTINATION <dir> [...])
  install(`DIRECTORY`_ <dir>... DESTINATION <dir> [...])
  install(`SCRIPT`_ <file> [...])
  install(`CODE`_ <code> [...])
  install(`EXPORT`_ <export-name> DESTINATION <dir> [...])

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This command generates installation rules for a project.  Rules
specified by calls to this command within a source directory are
executed in order during installation.  The order across directories
is not defined.

There are multiple signatures for this command.  Some of them define
installation options for files and targets.  Options common to
multiple signatures are covered here but they are valid only for
signatures that specify them.  The common options are:

``DESTINATION``
  Specify the directory on disk to which a file will be installed.
  If a full path (with a leading slash or drive letter) is given
  it is used directly.  If a relative path is given it is interpreted
  relative to the value of the :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable.
  The prefix can be relocated at install time using the ``DESTDIR``
  mechanism explained in the :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable
  documentation.

``PERMISSIONS``
  Specify permissions for installed files.  Valid permissions are
  ``OWNER_READ``, ``OWNER_WRITE``, ``OWNER_EXECUTE``, ``GROUP_READ``,
  ``GROUP_WRITE``, ``GROUP_EXECUTE``, ``WORLD_READ``, ``WORLD_WRITE``,
  ``WORLD_EXECUTE``, ``SETUID``, and ``SETGID``.  Permissions that do
  not make sense on certain platforms are ignored on those platforms.

``CONFIGURATIONS``
  Specify a list of build configurations for which the install rule
  applies (Debug, Release, etc.). Note that the values specified for
  this option only apply to options listed AFTER the ``CONFIGURATIONS``
  option. For example, to set separate install paths for the Debug and
  Release configurations, do the following:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    install(TARGETS target
            CONFIGURATIONS Debug
            RUNTIME DESTINATION Debug/bin)
    install(TARGETS target
            CONFIGURATIONS Release
            RUNTIME DESTINATION Release/bin)

  Note that ``CONFIGURATIONS`` appears BEFORE ``RUNTIME DESTINATION``.

``COMPONENT``
  Specify an installation component name with which the install rule
  is associated, such as "runtime" or "development".  During
  component-specific installation only install rules associated with
  the given component name will be executed.  During a full installation
  all components are installed unless marked with ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL``.
  If ``COMPONENT`` is not provided a default component "Unspecified" is
  created.  The default component name may be controlled with the
  :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_COMPONENT_NAME` variable.

``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL``
  Specify that the file is excluded from a full installation and only
  installed as part of a component-specific installation

``RENAME``
  Specify a name for an installed file that may be different from the
  original file.  Renaming is allowed only when a single file is
  installed by the command.

``OPTIONAL``
  Specify that it is not an error if the file to be installed does
  not exist.

Command signatures that install files may print messages during
installation.  Use the :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_MESSAGE` variable
to control which messages are printed.

Installing Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _TARGETS:

::

  install(TARGETS targets... [EXPORT <export-name>]
          [[ARCHIVE|LIBRARY|RUNTIME|OBJECTS|FRAMEWORK|BUNDLE|
            PRIVATE_HEADER|PUBLIC_HEADER|RESOURCE]
           [DESTINATION <dir>]
           [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
           [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
           [COMPONENT <component>]
           [NAMELINK_COMPONENT <component>]
           [OPTIONAL] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
           [NAMELINK_ONLY|NAMELINK_SKIP]
          ] [...]
          [INCLUDES DESTINATION [<dir> ...]]
          )

The ``TARGETS`` form specifies rules for installing targets from a
project.  There are several kinds of target files that may be installed:

``ARCHIVE``
  Static libraries are treated as ``ARCHIVE`` targets, except those
  marked with the ``FRAMEWORK`` property on OS X (see ``FRAMEWORK``
  below.) For DLL platforms (all Windows-based systems including
  Cygwin), the DLL import library is treated as an ``ARCHIVE`` target.

``LIBRARY``
  Module libraries are always treated as ``LIBRARY`` targets. For non-
  DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as ``LIBRARY`` targets,
  except those marked with the ``FRAMEWORK`` property on OS X (see
  ``FRAMEWORK`` below.)

``RUNTIME``
  Executables are treated as ``RUNTIME`` objects, except those marked
  with the ``MACOSX_BUNDLE`` property on OS X (see ``BUNDLE`` below.)
  For DLL platforms (all Windows-based systems including Cygwin), the
  DLL part of a shared library is treated as a ``RUNTIME`` target.

``OBJECTS``
  Object libraries (a simple group of object files) are always treated
  as ``OBJECTS`` targets.

``FRAMEWORK``
  Both static and shared libraries marked with the ``FRAMEWORK``
  property are treated as ``FRAMEWORK`` targets on OS X.

``BUNDLE``
  Executables marked with the ``MACOSX_BUNDLE`` property are treated as
  ``BUNDLE`` targets on OS X.

``PUBLIC_HEADER``
  Any ``PUBLIC_HEADER`` files associated with a library are installed in
  the destination specified by the ``PUBLIC_HEADER`` argument on non-Apple
  platforms. Rules defined by this argument are ignored for ``FRAMEWORK``
  libraries on Apple platforms because the associated files are installed
  into the appropriate locations inside the framework folder. See
  :prop_tgt:`PUBLIC_HEADER` for details.

``PRIVATE_HEADER``
  Similar to ``PUBLIC_HEADER``, but for ``PRIVATE_HEADER`` files. See
  :prop_tgt:`PRIVATE_HEADER` for details.

``RESOURCE``
  Similar to ``PUBLIC_HEADER`` and ``PRIVATE_HEADER``, but for
  ``RESOURCE`` files. See :prop_tgt:`RESOURCE` for details.

For each of these arguments given, the arguments following them only apply
to the target or file type specified in the argument. If none is given, the
installation properties apply to all target types. If only one is given then
only targets of that type will be installed (which can be used to install
just a DLL or just an import library.)

In addition to the common options listed above, each target can accept
the following additional arguments:

``NAMELINK_COMPONENT``
  On some platforms a versioned shared library has a symbolic link such
  as::

    lib<name>.so -> lib<name>.so.1

  where ``lib<name>.so.1`` is the soname of the library and ``lib<name>.so``
  is a "namelink" allowing linkers to find the library when given
  ``-l<name>``. The ``NAMELINK_COMPONENT`` option is similar to the
  ``COMPONENT`` option, but it changes the installation component of a shared
  library namelink if one is generated. If not specified, this defaults to the
  value of ``COMPONENT``. It is an error to use this parameter outside of a
  ``LIBRARY`` block.

  Consider the following example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    install(TARGETS mylib
            LIBRARY
              DESTINATION lib
              COMPONENT Libraries
              NAMELINK_COMPONENT Development
            PUBLIC_HEADER
              DESTINATION include
              COMPONENT Development
           )

  In this scenario, if you choose to install only the ``Development``
  component, both the headers and namelink will be installed without the
  library. (If you don't also install the ``Libraries`` component, the
  namelink will be a dangling symlink, and projects that link to the library
  will have build errors.) If you install only the ``Libraries`` component,
  only the library will be installed, without the headers and namelink.

  This option is typically used for package managers that have separate
  runtime and development packages. For example, on Debian systems, the
  library is expected to be in the runtime package, and the headers and
  namelink are expected to be in the development package.

  See the :prop_tgt:`VERSION` and :prop_tgt:`SOVERSION` target properties for
  details on creating versioned shared libraries.

``NAMELINK_ONLY``
  This option causes the installation of only the namelink when a library
  target is installed. On platforms where versioned shared libraries do not
  have namelinks or when a library is not versioned, the ``NAMELINK_ONLY``
  option installs nothing. It is an error to use this parameter outside of a
  ``LIBRARY`` block.

  When ``NAMELINK_ONLY`` is given, either ``NAMELINK_COMPONENT`` or
  ``COMPONENT`` may be used to specify the installation component of the
  namelink, but ``COMPONENT`` should generally be preferred.

``NAMELINK_SKIP``
  Similar to ``NAMELINK_ONLY``, but it has the opposite effect: it causes the
  installation of library files other than the namelink when a library target
  is installed. When neither ``NAMELINK_ONLY`` or ``NAMELINK_SKIP`` are given,
  both portions are installed. On platforms where versioned shared libraries
  do not have symlinks or when a library is not versioned, ``NAMELINK_SKIP``
  installs the library. It is an error to use this parameter outside of a
  ``LIBRARY`` block.

  If ``NAMELINK_SKIP`` is specified, ``NAMELINK_COMPONENT`` has no effect. It
  is not recommended to use ``NAMELINK_SKIP`` in conjunction with
  ``NAMELINK_COMPONENT``.

The ``install(TARGETS)`` command can also accept the following options at the
top level:

``EXPORT``
  This option associates the installed target files with an export called
  ``<export-name>``.  It must appear before any target options.  To actually
  install the export file itself, call ``install(EXPORT)``, documented below.

``INCLUDES DESTINATION``
  This option specifies a list of directories which will be added to the
  :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` target property of the
  ``<targets>`` when exported by the :command:`install(EXPORT)` command. If a
  relative path is specified, it is treated as relative to the
  ``$<INSTALL_PREFIX>``.

One or more groups of properties may be specified in a single call to
the ``TARGETS`` form of this command.  A target may be installed more than
once to different locations.  Consider hypothetical targets ``myExe``,
``mySharedLib``, and ``myStaticLib``.  The code:

.. code-block:: cmake

  install(TARGETS myExe mySharedLib myStaticLib
          RUNTIME DESTINATION bin
          LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
          ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib/static)
  install(TARGETS mySharedLib DESTINATION /some/full/path)

will install ``myExe`` to ``<prefix>/bin`` and ``myStaticLib`` to
``<prefix>/lib/static``.  On non-DLL platforms ``mySharedLib`` will be
installed to ``<prefix>/lib`` and ``/some/full/path``.  On DLL platforms
the ``mySharedLib`` DLL will be installed to ``<prefix>/bin`` and
``/some/full/path`` and its import library will be installed to
``<prefix>/lib/static`` and ``/some/full/path``.

:ref:`Interface Libraries` may be listed among the targets to install.
They install no artifacts but will be included in an associated ``EXPORT``.
If :ref:`Object Libraries` are listed but given no destination for their
object files, they will be exported as :ref:`Interface Libraries`.
This is sufficient to satisfy transitive usage requirements of other
targets that link to the object libraries in their implementation.

Installing a target with the :prop_tgt:`EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL` target property
set to ``TRUE`` has undefined behavior.

The install destination given to the target install ``DESTINATION`` may
use "generator expressions" with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the
:manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual for available expressions.

Installing Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _FILES:
.. _PROGRAMS:

::

  install(<FILES|PROGRAMS> files... DESTINATION <dir>
          [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
          [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
          [COMPONENT <component>]
          [RENAME <name>] [OPTIONAL] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL])

The ``FILES`` form specifies rules for installing files for a project.
File names given as relative paths are interpreted with respect to the
current source directory.  Files installed by this form are by default
given permissions ``OWNER_WRITE``, ``OWNER_READ``, ``GROUP_READ``, and
``WORLD_READ`` if no ``PERMISSIONS`` argument is given.

The ``PROGRAMS`` form is identical to the ``FILES`` form except that the
default permissions for the installed file also include ``OWNER_EXECUTE``,
``GROUP_EXECUTE``, and ``WORLD_EXECUTE``.  This form is intended to install
programs that are not targets, such as shell scripts.  Use the ``TARGETS``
form to install targets built within the project.

The list of ``files...`` given to ``FILES`` or ``PROGRAMS`` may use
"generator expressions" with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the
:manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual for available expressions.
However, if any item begins in a generator expression it must evaluate
to a full path.

The install destination given to the files install ``DESTINATION`` may
use "generator expressions" with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the
:manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual for available expressions.

Installing Directories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _DIRECTORY:

::

  install(DIRECTORY dirs... DESTINATION <dir>
          [FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
          [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
          [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [OPTIONAL] [MESSAGE_NEVER]
          [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
          [COMPONENT <component>] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
          [FILES_MATCHING]
          [[PATTERN <pattern> | REGEX <regex>]
           [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]] [...])

The ``DIRECTORY`` form installs contents of one or more directories to a
given destination.  The directory structure is copied verbatim to the
destination.  The last component of each directory name is appended to
the destination directory but a trailing slash may be used to avoid
this because it leaves the last component empty.  Directory names
given as relative paths are interpreted with respect to the current
source directory.  If no input directory names are given the
destination directory will be created but nothing will be installed
into it.  The ``FILE_PERMISSIONS`` and ``DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS`` options
specify permissions given to files and directories in the destination.
If ``USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS`` is specified and ``FILE_PERMISSIONS`` is not,
file permissions will be copied from the source directory structure.
If no permissions are specified files will be given the default
permissions specified in the ``FILES`` form of the command, and the
directories will be given the default permissions specified in the
``PROGRAMS`` form of the command.

The ``MESSAGE_NEVER`` option disables file installation status output.

Installation of directories may be controlled with fine granularity
using the ``PATTERN`` or ``REGEX`` options.  These "match" options specify a
globbing pattern or regular expression to match directories or files
encountered within input directories.  They may be used to apply
certain options (see below) to a subset of the files and directories
encountered.  The full path to each input file or directory (with
forward slashes) is matched against the expression.  A ``PATTERN`` will
match only complete file names: the portion of the full path matching
the pattern must occur at the end of the file name and be preceded by
a slash.  A ``REGEX`` will match any portion of the full path but it may
use ``/`` and ``$`` to simulate the ``PATTERN`` behavior.  By default all
files and directories are installed whether or not they are matched.
The ``FILES_MATCHING`` option may be given before the first match option
to disable installation of files (but not directories) not matched by
any expression.  For example, the code

.. code-block:: cmake

  install(DIRECTORY src/ DESTINATION include/myproj
          FILES_MATCHING PATTERN "*.h")

will extract and install header files from a source tree.

Some options may follow a ``PATTERN`` or ``REGEX`` expression and are applied
only to files or directories matching them.  The ``EXCLUDE`` option will
skip the matched file or directory.  The ``PERMISSIONS`` option overrides
the permissions setting for the matched file or directory.  For
example the code

.. code-block:: cmake

  install(DIRECTORY icons scripts/ DESTINATION share/myproj
          PATTERN "CVS" EXCLUDE
          PATTERN "scripts/*"
          PERMISSIONS OWNER_EXECUTE OWNER_WRITE OWNER_READ
                      GROUP_EXECUTE GROUP_READ)

will install the ``icons`` directory to ``share/myproj/icons`` and the
``scripts`` directory to ``share/myproj``.  The icons will get default
file permissions, the scripts will be given specific permissions, and any
``CVS`` directories will be excluded.

The list of ``dirs...`` given to ``DIRECTORY`` and the install destination
given to the directory install ``DESTINATION`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
manual for available expressions.

Custom Installation Logic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _CODE:
.. _SCRIPT:

::

  install([[SCRIPT <file>] [CODE <code>]]
          [COMPONENT <component>] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [...])

The ``SCRIPT`` form will invoke the given CMake script files during
installation.  If the script file name is a relative path it will be
interpreted with respect to the current source directory.  The ``CODE``
form will invoke the given CMake code during installation.  Code is
specified as a single argument inside a double-quoted string.  For
example, the code

.. code-block:: cmake

  install(CODE "MESSAGE(\"Sample install message.\")")

will print a message during installation.

Installing Exports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _EXPORT:

::

  install(EXPORT <export-name> DESTINATION <dir>
          [NAMESPACE <namespace>] [[FILE <name>.cmake]|
          [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
          [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
          [EXPORT_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES]
          [COMPONENT <component>]
          [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL])
  install(EXPORT_ANDROID_MK <export-name> DESTINATION <dir> [...])

The ``EXPORT`` form generates and installs a CMake file containing code to
import targets from the installation tree into another project.
Target installations are associated with the export ``<export-name>``
using the ``EXPORT`` option of the ``install(TARGETS)`` signature
documented above.  The ``NAMESPACE`` option will prepend ``<namespace>`` to
the target names as they are written to the import file.  By default
the generated file will be called ``<export-name>.cmake`` but the ``FILE``
option may be used to specify a different name.  The value given to
the ``FILE`` option must be a file name with the ``.cmake`` extension.
If a ``CONFIGURATIONS`` option is given then the file will only be installed
when one of the named configurations is installed.  Additionally, the
generated import file will reference only the matching target
configurations.  The ``EXPORT_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES`` keyword, if
present, causes the contents of the properties matching
``(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_<CONFIG>)?`` to be exported, when
policy :policy:`CMP0022` is ``NEW``.

When a ``COMPONENT`` option is given, the listed ``<component>`` implicitly
depends on all components mentioned in the export set. The exported
``<name>.cmake`` file will require each of the exported components to be
present in order for dependent projects to build properly. For example, a
project may define components ``Runtime`` and ``Development``, with shared
libraries going into the ``Runtime`` component and static libraries and
headers going into the ``Development`` component. The export set would also
typically be part of the ``Development`` component, but it would export
targets from both the ``Runtime`` and ``Development`` components. Therefore,
the ``Runtime`` component would need to be installed if the ``Development``
component was installed, but not vice versa. If the ``Development`` component
was installed without the ``Runtime`` component, dependent projects that try
to link against it would have build errors. Package managers, such as APT and
RPM, typically handle this by listing the ``Runtime`` component as a dependency
of the ``Development`` component in the package metadata, ensuring that the
library is always installed if the headers and CMake export file are present.

In addition to cmake language files, the ``EXPORT_ANDROID_MK`` mode maybe
used to specify an export to the android ndk build system.  This mode
accepts the same options as the normal export mode.  The Android
NDK supports the use of prebuilt libraries, both static and shared. This
allows cmake to build the libraries of a project and make them available
to an ndk build system complete with transitive dependencies, include flags
and defines required to use the libraries.

The ``EXPORT`` form is useful to help outside projects use targets built
and installed by the current project.  For example, the code

.. code-block:: cmake

  install(TARGETS myexe EXPORT myproj DESTINATION bin)
  install(EXPORT myproj NAMESPACE mp_ DESTINATION lib/myproj)
  install(EXPORT_ANDROID_MK myexp DESTINATION share/ndk-modules)

will install the executable myexe to ``<prefix>/bin`` and code to import
it in the file ``<prefix>/lib/myproj/myproj.cmake`` and
``<prefix>/share/ndk-modules/Android.mk``.  An outside project
may load this file with the include command and reference the ``myexe``
executable from the installation tree using the imported target name
``mp_myexe`` as if the target were built in its own tree.

.. note::
  This command supercedes the :command:`install_targets` command and
  the :prop_tgt:`PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT` and :prop_tgt:`POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT`
  target properties.  It also replaces the ``FILES`` forms of the
  :command:`install_files` and :command:`install_programs` commands.
  The processing order of these install rules relative to
  those generated by :command:`install_targets`,
  :command:`install_files`, and :command:`install_programs` commands
  is not defined.

Generated Installation Script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``install()`` command generates a file, ``cmake_install.cmake``, inside
the build directory, which is used internally by the generated install target
and by CPack. You can also invoke this script manually with ``cmake -P``. This
script accepts several variables:

``COMPONENT``
  Set this variable to install only a single CPack component as opposed to all
  of them. For example, if you only want to install the ``Development``
  component, run ``cmake -DCOMPONENT=Development -P cmake_install.cmake``.

``BUILD_TYPE``
  Set this variable to change the build type if you are using a multi-config
  generator. For example, to install with the ``Debug`` configuration, run
  ``cmake -DBUILD_TYPE=Debug -P cmake_install.cmake``.

``DESTDIR``
  This is an environment variable rather than a CMake variable. It allows you
  to change the installation prefix on UNIX systems. See :envvar:`DESTDIR` for
  details.
cmake_minimum_required
----------------------

Set the minimum required version of cmake for a project and
update `Policy Settings`_ to match the version given::

  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION <min>[...<max>] [FATAL_ERROR])

``<min>`` and the optional ``<max>`` are each CMake versions of the form
``major.minor[.patch[.tweak]]``, and the ``...`` is literal.

If the running version of CMake is lower than the ``<min>`` required
version it will stop processing the project and report an error.
The optional ``<max>`` version, if specified, must be at least the
``<min>`` version and affects policy settings as described below.

The ``FATAL_ERROR`` option is accepted but ignored by CMake 2.6 and
higher.  It should be specified so CMake versions 2.4 and lower fail
with an error instead of just a warning.

.. note::
  Call the ``cmake_minimum_required()`` command at the beginning of
  the top-level ``CMakeLists.txt`` file even before calling the
  :command:`project` command.  It is important to establish version
  and policy settings before invoking other commands whose behavior
  they may affect.  See also policy :policy:`CMP0000`.

  Calling ``cmake_minimum_required()`` inside a :command:`function`
  limits some effects to the function scope when invoked.  Such calls
  should not be made with the intention of having global effects.

Policy Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)`` command implicitly invokes the
:command:`cmake_policy(VERSION)` command to specify that the current
project code is written for the given range of CMake versions.
All policies known to the running version of CMake and introduced
in the ``<min>`` (or ``<max>``, if specified) version or earlier will
be set to use ``NEW`` behavior.  All policies introduced in later
versions will be unset.  This effectively requests behavior preferred
as of a given CMake version and tells newer CMake versions to warn
about their new policies.

When a ``<min>`` version higher than 2.4 is specified the command
implicitly invokes::

  cmake_policy(VERSION <min>[...<max>])

which sets CMake policies based on the range of versions specified.
When a ``<min>`` version 2.4 or lower is given the command implicitly
invokes::

  cmake_policy(VERSION 2.4[...<max>])

which enables compatibility features for CMake 2.4 and lower.
output_required_files
---------------------

Disallowed.  See CMake Policy :policy:`CMP0032`.

Approximate C preprocessor dependency scanning.

This command exists only because ancient CMake versions provided it.
CMake handles preprocessor dependency scanning automatically using a
more advanced scanner.

::

  output_required_files(srcfile outputfile)

Outputs a list of all the source files that are required by the
specified srcfile.  This list is written into outputfile.  This is
similar to writing out the dependencies for srcfile except that it
jumps from .h files into .cxx, .c and .cpp files if possible.
install_files
-------------

Deprecated.  Use the :command:`install(FILES)` command instead.

This command has been superceded by the :command:`install` command.  It is
provided for compatibility with older CMake code.  The ``FILES`` form is
directly replaced by the ``FILES`` form of the :command:`install`
command.  The regexp form can be expressed more clearly using the ``GLOB``
form of the :command:`file` command.

::

  install_files(<dir> extension file file ...)

Create rules to install the listed files with the given extension into
the given directory.  Only files existing in the current source tree
or its corresponding location in the binary tree may be listed.  If a
file specified already has an extension, that extension will be
removed first.  This is useful for providing lists of source files
such as foo.cxx when you want the corresponding foo.h to be installed.
A typical extension is '.h'.

::

  install_files(<dir> regexp)

Any files in the current source directory that match the regular
expression will be installed.

::

  install_files(<dir> FILES file file ...)

Any files listed after the ``FILES`` keyword will be installed explicitly
from the names given.  Full paths are allowed in this form.

The directory ``<dir>`` is relative to the installation prefix, which is
stored in the variable :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.
cmake_host_system_information
-----------------------------

Query host system specific information.

::

  cmake_host_system_information(RESULT <variable> QUERY <key> ...)

Queries system information of the host system on which cmake runs.
One or more ``<key>`` can be provided to select the information to be
queried.  The list of queried values is stored in ``<variable>``.

``<key>`` can be one of the following values:

============================= ================================================
Key                           Description
============================= ================================================
``NUMBER_OF_LOGICAL_CORES``   Number of logical cores
``NUMBER_OF_PHYSICAL_CORES``  Number of physical cores
``HOSTNAME``                  Hostname
``FQDN``                      Fully qualified domain name
``TOTAL_VIRTUAL_MEMORY``      Total virtual memory in megabytes
``AVAILABLE_VIRTUAL_MEMORY``  Available virtual memory in megabytes
``TOTAL_PHYSICAL_MEMORY``     Total physical memory in megabytes
``AVAILABLE_PHYSICAL_MEMORY`` Available physical memory in megabytes
``IS_64BIT``                  One if processor is 64Bit
``HAS_FPU``                   One if processor has floating point unit
``HAS_MMX``                   One if processor supports MMX instructions
``HAS_MMX_PLUS``              One if processor supports Ext. MMX instructions
``HAS_SSE``                   One if processor supports SSE instructions
``HAS_SSE2``                  One if processor supports SSE2 instructions
``HAS_SSE_FP``                One if processor supports SSE FP instructions
``HAS_SSE_MMX``               One if processor supports SSE MMX instructions
``HAS_AMD_3DNOW``             One if processor supports 3DNow instructions
``HAS_AMD_3DNOW_PLUS``        One if processor supports 3DNow+ instructions
``HAS_IA64``                  One if IA64 processor emulating x86
``HAS_SERIAL_NUMBER``         One if processor has serial number
``PROCESSOR_SERIAL_NUMBER``   Processor serial number
``PROCESSOR_NAME``            Human readable processor name
``PROCESSOR_DESCRIPTION``     Human readable full processor description
``OS_NAME``                   See :variable:`CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME`

============================= ================================================
add_compile_options
-------------------

Adds options to the compilation of source files.

::

  add_compile_options(<option> ...)

Adds options to the compiler command line for targets in the current
directory and below that are added after this command is invoked.
See documentation of the :prop_dir:`directory <COMPILE_OPTIONS>` and
:prop_tgt:`target <COMPILE_OPTIONS>` ``COMPILE_OPTIONS`` properties.

This command can be used to add any options, but alternative commands
exist to add preprocessor definitions (:command:`target_compile_definitions`
and :command:`add_compile_definitions`) or include directories
(:command:`target_include_directories` and :command:`include_directories`).

Arguments to ``add_compile_options`` may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)`
manual for available expressions.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)`
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

.. include:: COMPILE_OPTIONS_SHELL.txt
foreach
-------

Evaluate a group of commands for each value in a list.

::

  foreach(loop_var arg1 arg2 ...)
    COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
    COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
    ...
  endforeach(loop_var)

All commands between foreach and the matching endforeach are recorded
without being invoked.  Once the endforeach is evaluated, the recorded
list of commands is invoked once for each argument listed in the
original foreach command.  Before each iteration of the loop
``${loop_var}`` will be set as a variable with the current value in the
list.

::

  foreach(loop_var RANGE total)
  foreach(loop_var RANGE start stop [step])

Foreach can also iterate over a generated range of numbers.  There are
three types of this iteration:

* When specifying single number, the range will have elements [0, ... to
  "total"] (inclusive).

* When specifying two numbers, the range will have elements from the
  first number to the second number (inclusive).

* The third optional number is the increment used to iterate from the
  first number to the second number (inclusive).

::

  foreach(loop_var IN [LISTS [list1 [...]]]
                      [ITEMS [item1 [...]]])

Iterates over a precise list of items.  The ``LISTS`` option names
list-valued variables to be traversed, including empty elements (an
empty string is a zero-length list).  (Note macro
arguments are not variables.)  The ``ITEMS`` option ends argument
parsing and includes all arguments following it in the iteration.
write_file
----------

Deprecated. Use the :command:`file(WRITE)` command instead.

::

  write_file(filename "message to write"... [APPEND])

The first argument is the file name, the rest of the arguments are
messages to write.  If the argument ``APPEND`` is specified, then the
message will be appended.

NOTE 1: :command:`file(WRITE)`  and :command:`file(APPEND)`  do exactly
the same as this one but add some more functionality.

NOTE 2: When using ``write_file`` the produced file cannot be used as an
input to CMake (CONFIGURE_FILE, source file ...) because it will lead
to an infinite loop.  Use :command:`configure_file` if you want to
generate input files to CMake.
file
----

File manipulation command.

Reading
^^^^^^^

.. _READ:

::

  file(READ <filename> <variable>
       [OFFSET <offset>] [LIMIT <max-in>] [HEX])

Read content from a file called ``<filename>`` and store it in a
``<variable>``.  Optionally start from the given ``<offset>`` and
read at most ``<max-in>`` bytes.  The ``HEX`` option causes data to
be converted to a hexadecimal representation (useful for binary data).

.. _STRINGS:

::

  file(STRINGS <filename> <variable> [<options>...])

Parse a list of ASCII strings from ``<filename>`` and store it in
``<variable>``.  Binary data in the file are ignored.  Carriage return
(``\r``, CR) characters are ignored.  The options are:

``LENGTH_MAXIMUM <max-len>``
 Consider only strings of at most a given length.

``LENGTH_MINIMUM <min-len>``
 Consider only strings of at least a given length.

``LIMIT_COUNT <max-num>``
 Limit the number of distinct strings to be extracted.

``LIMIT_INPUT <max-in>``
 Limit the number of input bytes to read from the file.

``LIMIT_OUTPUT <max-out>``
 Limit the number of total bytes to store in the ``<variable>``.

``NEWLINE_CONSUME``
 Treat newline characters (``\n``, LF) as part of string content
 instead of terminating at them.

``NO_HEX_CONVERSION``
 Intel Hex and Motorola S-record files are automatically converted to
 binary while reading unless this option is given.

``REGEX <regex>``
 Consider only strings that match the given regular expression.

``ENCODING <encoding-type>``
 Consider strings of a given encoding.  Currently supported encodings are:
 UTF-8, UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE, UTF-32LE, UTF-32BE.  If the ENCODING option
 is not provided and the file has a Byte Order Mark, the ENCODING option
 will be defaulted to respect the Byte Order Mark.

For example, the code

.. code-block:: cmake

  file(STRINGS myfile.txt myfile)

stores a list in the variable ``myfile`` in which each item is a line
from the input file.

.. _HASH:

::

  file(<HASH> <filename> <variable>)

Compute a cryptographic hash of the content of ``<filename>`` and
store it in a ``<variable>``.  The supported ``<HASH>`` algorithm names
are those listed by the :ref:`string(\<HASH\>) <Supported Hash Algorithms>`
command.

.. _TIMESTAMP:

::

  file(TIMESTAMP <filename> <variable> [<format>] [UTC])

Compute a string representation of the modification time of ``<filename>``
and store it in ``<variable>``.  Should the command be unable to obtain a
timestamp variable will be set to the empty string ("").

See the :command:`string(TIMESTAMP)` command for documentation of
the ``<format>`` and ``UTC`` options.

Writing
^^^^^^^

.. _WRITE:
.. _APPEND:

::

  file(WRITE <filename> <content>...)
  file(APPEND <filename> <content>...)

Write ``<content>`` into a file called ``<filename>``.  If the file does
not exist, it will be created.  If the file already exists, ``WRITE``
mode will overwrite it and ``APPEND`` mode will append to the end.
Any directories in the path specified by ``<filename>`` that do not
exist will be created.

If the file is a build input, use the :command:`configure_file` command
to update the file only when its content changes.

.. _TOUCH:
.. _TOUCH_NOCREATE:

::

  file(TOUCH [<files>...])
  file(TOUCH_NOCREATE [<files>...])

Create a file with no content if it does not yet exist. If the file already
exists, its access and/or modification will be updated to the time when the
function call is executed.

Use TOUCH_NOCREATE to touch a file if it exists but not create it. If a file
does not exist it will be silently ignored.

With TOUCH and TOUCH_NOCREATE the contents of an existing file will not be
modified.

.. _GENERATE:

::

  file(GENERATE OUTPUT output-file
       <INPUT input-file|CONTENT content>
       [CONDITION expression])

Generate an output file for each build configuration supported by the current
:manual:`CMake Generator <cmake-generators(7)>`.  Evaluate
:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
from the input content to produce the output content.  The options are:

``CONDITION <condition>``
  Generate the output file for a particular configuration only if
  the condition is true.  The condition must be either ``0`` or ``1``
  after evaluating generator expressions.

``CONTENT <content>``
  Use the content given explicitly as input.

``INPUT <input-file>``
  Use the content from a given file as input.
  A relative path is treated with respect to the value of
  :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`.  See policy :policy:`CMP0070`.

``OUTPUT <output-file>``
  Specify the output file name to generate.  Use generator expressions
  such as ``$<CONFIG>`` to specify a configuration-specific output file
  name.  Multiple configurations may generate the same output file only
  if the generated content is identical.  Otherwise, the ``<output-file>``
  must evaluate to an unique name for each configuration.
  A relative path (after evaluating generator expressions) is treated
  with respect to the value of :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0070`.

Exactly one ``CONTENT`` or ``INPUT`` option must be given.  A specific
``OUTPUT`` file may be named by at most one invocation of ``file(GENERATE)``.
Generated files are modified and their timestamp updated on subsequent cmake
runs only if their content is changed.

Note also that ``file(GENERATE)`` does not create the output file until the
generation phase. The output file will not yet have been written when the
``file(GENERATE)`` command returns, it is written only after processing all
of a project's ``CMakeLists.txt`` files.

Filesystem
^^^^^^^^^^

.. _GLOB:
.. _GLOB_RECURSE:

::

  file(GLOB <variable>
       [LIST_DIRECTORIES true|false] [RELATIVE <path>] [CONFIGURE_DEPENDS]
       [<globbing-expressions>...])
  file(GLOB_RECURSE <variable> [FOLLOW_SYMLINKS]
       [LIST_DIRECTORIES true|false] [RELATIVE <path>] [CONFIGURE_DEPENDS]
       [<globbing-expressions>...])

Generate a list of files that match the ``<globbing-expressions>`` and
store it into the ``<variable>``.  Globbing expressions are similar to
regular expressions, but much simpler.  If ``RELATIVE`` flag is
specified, the results will be returned as relative paths to the given
path.  The results will be ordered lexicographically.

If the ``CONFIGURE_DEPENDS`` flag is specified, CMake will add logic
to the main build system check target to rerun the flagged ``GLOB`` commands
at build time. If any of the outputs change, CMake will regenerate the build
system.

By default ``GLOB`` lists directories - directories are omitted in result if
``LIST_DIRECTORIES`` is set to false.

.. note::
  We do not recommend using GLOB to collect a list of source files from
  your source tree.  If no CMakeLists.txt file changes when a source is
  added or removed then the generated build system cannot know when to
  ask CMake to regenerate.
  The ``CONFIGURE_DEPENDS`` flag may not work reliably on all generators, or if
  a new generator is added in the future that cannot support it, projects using
  it will be stuck. Even if ``CONFIGURE_DEPENDS`` works reliably, there is
  still a cost to perform the check on every rebuild.

Examples of globbing expressions include::

  *.cxx      - match all files with extension cxx
  *.vt?      - match all files with extension vta,...,vtz
  f[3-5].txt - match files f3.txt, f4.txt, f5.txt

The ``GLOB_RECURSE`` mode will traverse all the subdirectories of the
matched directory and match the files.  Subdirectories that are symlinks
are only traversed if ``FOLLOW_SYMLINKS`` is given or policy
:policy:`CMP0009` is not set to ``NEW``.

By default ``GLOB_RECURSE`` omits directories from result list - setting
``LIST_DIRECTORIES`` to true adds directories to result list.
If ``FOLLOW_SYMLINKS`` is given or policy :policy:`CMP0009` is not set to
``OLD`` then ``LIST_DIRECTORIES`` treats symlinks as directories.

Examples of recursive globbing include::

  /dir/*.py  - match all python files in /dir and subdirectories

.. _RENAME:

::

  file(RENAME <oldname> <newname>)

Move a file or directory within a filesystem from ``<oldname>`` to
``<newname>``, replacing the destination atomically.

.. _REMOVE:
.. _REMOVE_RECURSE:

::

  file(REMOVE [<files>...])
  file(REMOVE_RECURSE [<files>...])

Remove the given files.  The ``REMOVE_RECURSE`` mode will remove the given
files and directories, also non-empty directories. No error is emitted if a
given file does not exist.

.. _MAKE_DIRECTORY:

::

  file(MAKE_DIRECTORY [<directories>...])

Create the given directories and their parents as needed.

.. _COPY:
.. _INSTALL:

::

  file(<COPY|INSTALL> <files>... DESTINATION <dir>
       [FILE_PERMISSIONS <permissions>...]
       [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS <permissions>...]
       [NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS]
       [FILES_MATCHING]
       [[PATTERN <pattern> | REGEX <regex>]
        [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS <permissions>...]] [...])

The ``COPY`` signature copies files, directories, and symlinks to a
destination folder.  Relative input paths are evaluated with respect
to the current source directory, and a relative destination is
evaluated with respect to the current build directory.  Copying
preserves input file timestamps, and optimizes out a file if it exists
at the destination with the same timestamp.  Copying preserves input
permissions unless explicit permissions or ``NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS``
are given (default is ``USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS``).

See the :command:`install(DIRECTORY)` command for documentation of
permissions, ``FILES_MATCHING``, ``PATTERN``, ``REGEX``, and
``EXCLUDE`` options.  Copying directories preserves the structure
of their content even if options are used to select a subset of
files.

The ``INSTALL`` signature differs slightly from ``COPY``: it prints
status messages (subject to the :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_MESSAGE` variable),
and ``NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS`` is default.
Installation scripts generated by the :command:`install` command
use this signature (with some undocumented options for internal use).

Path Conversion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _RELATIVE_PATH:

::

  file(RELATIVE_PATH <variable> <directory> <file>)

Compute the relative path from a ``<directory>`` to a ``<file>`` and
store it in the ``<variable>``.

.. _TO_CMAKE_PATH:
.. _TO_NATIVE_PATH:

::

  file(TO_CMAKE_PATH "<path>" <variable>)
  file(TO_NATIVE_PATH "<path>" <variable>)

The ``TO_CMAKE_PATH`` mode converts a native ``<path>`` into a cmake-style
path with forward-slashes (``/``).  The input can be a single path or a
system search path like ``$ENV{PATH}``.  A search path will be converted
to a cmake-style list separated by ``;`` characters.

The ``TO_NATIVE_PATH`` mode converts a cmake-style ``<path>`` into a native
path with platform-specific slashes (``\`` on Windows and ``/`` elsewhere).

Always use double quotes around the ``<path>`` to be sure it is treated
as a single argument to this command.

Transfer
^^^^^^^^

.. _DOWNLOAD:
.. _UPLOAD:

::

  file(DOWNLOAD <url> <file> [<options>...])
  file(UPLOAD   <file> <url> [<options>...])

The ``DOWNLOAD`` mode downloads the given ``<url>`` to a local ``<file>``.
The ``UPLOAD`` mode uploads a local ``<file>`` to a given ``<url>``.

Options to both ``DOWNLOAD`` and ``UPLOAD`` are:

``INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT <seconds>``
  Terminate the operation after a period of inactivity.

``LOG <variable>``
  Store a human-readable log of the operation in a variable.

``SHOW_PROGRESS``
  Print progress information as status messages until the operation is
  complete.

``STATUS <variable>``
  Store the resulting status of the operation in a variable.
  The status is a ``;`` separated list of length 2.
  The first element is the numeric return value for the operation,
  and the second element is a string value for the error.
  A ``0`` numeric error means no error in the operation.

``TIMEOUT <seconds>``
  Terminate the operation after a given total time has elapsed.

``USERPWD <username>:<password>``
  Set username and password for operation.

``HTTPHEADER <HTTP-header>``
  HTTP header for operation. Suboption can be repeated several times.

``NETRC <level>``
  Specify whether the .netrc file is to be used for operation.  If this
  option is not specified, the value of the ``CMAKE_NETRC`` variable
  will be used instead.
  Valid levels are:

  ``IGNORED``
    The .netrc file is ignored.
    This is the default.
  ``OPTIONAL``
    The .netrc file is optional, and information in the URL is preferred.
    The file will be scanned to find which ever information is not specified
    in the URL.
  ``REQUIRED``
    The .netrc file is required, and information in the URL is ignored.

``NETRC_FILE <file>``
  Specify an alternative .netrc file to the one in your home directory,
  if the ``NETRC`` level is ``OPTIONAL`` or ``REQUIRED``. If this option
  is not specified, the value of the ``CMAKE_NETRC_FILE`` variable will
  be used instead.

If neither ``NETRC`` option is given CMake will check variables
``CMAKE_NETRC`` and ``CMAKE_NETRC_FILE``, respectively.

Additional options to ``DOWNLOAD`` are:

``EXPECTED_HASH ALGO=<value>``

  Verify that the downloaded content hash matches the expected value, where
  ``ALGO`` is one of the algorithms supported by ``file(<HASH>)``.
  If it does not match, the operation fails with an error.

``EXPECTED_MD5 <value>``
  Historical short-hand for ``EXPECTED_HASH MD5=<value>``.

``TLS_VERIFY <ON|OFF>``
  Specify whether to verify the server certificate for ``https://`` URLs.
  The default is to *not* verify.

``TLS_CAINFO <file>``
  Specify a custom Certificate Authority file for ``https://`` URLs.

For ``https://`` URLs CMake must be built with OpenSSL support.  ``TLS/SSL``
certificates are not checked by default.  Set ``TLS_VERIFY`` to ``ON`` to
check certificates and/or use ``EXPECTED_HASH`` to verify downloaded content.
If neither ``TLS`` option is given CMake will check variables
``CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY`` and ``CMAKE_TLS_CAINFO``, respectively.

Locking
^^^^^^^

.. _LOCK:

::

  file(LOCK <path> [DIRECTORY] [RELEASE]
       [GUARD <FUNCTION|FILE|PROCESS>]
       [RESULT_VARIABLE <variable>]
       [TIMEOUT <seconds>])

Lock a file specified by ``<path>`` if no ``DIRECTORY`` option present and file
``<path>/cmake.lock`` otherwise. File will be locked for scope defined by
``GUARD`` option (default value is ``PROCESS``). ``RELEASE`` option can be used
to unlock file explicitly. If option ``TIMEOUT`` is not specified CMake will
wait until lock succeed or until fatal error occurs. If ``TIMEOUT`` is set to
``0`` lock will be tried once and result will be reported immediately. If
``TIMEOUT`` is not ``0`` CMake will try to lock file for the period specified
by ``<seconds>`` value. Any errors will be interpreted as fatal if there is no
``RESULT_VARIABLE`` option. Otherwise result will be stored in ``<variable>``
and will be ``0`` on success or error message on failure.

Note that lock is advisory - there is no guarantee that other processes will
respect this lock, i.e. lock synchronize two or more CMake instances sharing
some modifiable resources. Similar logic applied to ``DIRECTORY`` option -
locking parent directory doesn't prevent other ``LOCK`` commands to lock any
child directory or file.

Trying to lock file twice is not allowed.  Any intermediate directories and
file itself will be created if they not exist.  ``GUARD`` and ``TIMEOUT``
options ignored on ``RELEASE`` operation.
math
----

Mathematical expressions.

::

  math(EXPR <output-variable> <math-expression>)

``EXPR`` evaluates mathematical expression and returns result in the
output variable.  Example mathematical expression is ``5 * (10 + 13)``.
Supported operators are ``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``/``, ``%``, ``|``, ``&``,
``^``, ``~``, ``<<``, ``>>``, and ``(...)``.  They have the same meaning
as they do in C code.
add_custom_command
------------------

Add a custom build rule to the generated build system.

There are two main signatures for ``add_custom_command``.

Generating Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first signature is for adding a custom command to produce an output::

  add_custom_command(OUTPUT output1 [output2 ...]
                     COMMAND command1 [ARGS] [args1...]
                     [COMMAND command2 [ARGS] [args2...] ...]
                     [MAIN_DEPENDENCY depend]
                     [DEPENDS [depends...]]
                     [BYPRODUCTS [files...]]
                     [IMPLICIT_DEPENDS <lang1> depend1
                                      [<lang2> depend2] ...]
                     [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                     [COMMENT comment]
                     [DEPFILE depfile]
                     [VERBATIM] [APPEND] [USES_TERMINAL]
                     [COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS])

This defines a command to generate specified ``OUTPUT`` file(s).
A target created in the same directory (``CMakeLists.txt`` file)
that specifies any output of the custom command as a source file
is given a rule to generate the file using the command at build time.
Do not list the output in more than one independent target that
may build in parallel or the two instances of the rule may conflict
(instead use the :command:`add_custom_target` command to drive the
command and make the other targets depend on that one).
In makefile terms this creates a new target in the following form::

  OUTPUT: MAIN_DEPENDENCY DEPENDS
          COMMAND

The options are:

``APPEND``
  Append the ``COMMAND`` and ``DEPENDS`` option values to the custom
  command for the first output specified.  There must have already
  been a previous call to this command with the same output.
  The ``COMMENT``, ``MAIN_DEPENDENCY``, and ``WORKING_DIRECTORY``
  options are currently ignored when APPEND is given, but may be
  used in the future.

``BYPRODUCTS``
  Specify the files the command is expected to produce but whose
  modification time may or may not be newer than the dependencies.
  If a byproduct name is a relative path it will be interpreted
  relative to the build tree directory corresponding to the
  current source directory.
  Each byproduct file will be marked with the :prop_sf:`GENERATED`
  source file property automatically.

  Explicit specification of byproducts is supported by the
  :generator:`Ninja` generator to tell the ``ninja`` build tool
  how to regenerate byproducts when they are missing.  It is
  also useful when other build rules (e.g. custom commands)
  depend on the byproducts.  Ninja requires a build rule for any
  generated file on which another rule depends even if there are
  order-only dependencies to ensure the byproducts will be
  available before their dependents build.

  The ``BYPRODUCTS`` option is ignored on non-Ninja generators
  except to mark byproducts ``GENERATED``.

``COMMAND``
  Specify the command-line(s) to execute at build time.
  If more than one ``COMMAND`` is specified they will be executed in order,
  but *not* necessarily composed into a stateful shell or batch script.
  (To run a full script, use the :command:`configure_file` command or the
  :command:`file(GENERATE)` command to create it, and then specify
  a ``COMMAND`` to launch it.)
  The optional ``ARGS`` argument is for backward compatibility and
  will be ignored.

  If ``COMMAND`` specifies an executable target name (created by the
  :command:`add_executable` command) it will automatically be replaced
  by the location of the executable created at build time. If set, the
  :prop_tgt:`CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR` executable target property will
  also be prepended to the command to allow the executable to run on
  the host.
  (Use the ``TARGET_FILE``
  :manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` to
  reference an executable later in the command line.)
  Additionally a target-level dependency will be added so that the
  executable target will be built before any target using this custom
  command.  However this does NOT add a file-level dependency that
  would cause the custom command to re-run whenever the executable is
  recompiled.

  Arguments to ``COMMAND`` may use
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.
  References to target names in generator expressions imply target-level
  dependencies, but NOT file-level dependencies.  List target names with
  the ``DEPENDS`` option to add file-level dependencies.

``COMMENT``
  Display the given message before the commands are executed at
  build time.

``DEPENDS``
  Specify files on which the command depends.  If any dependency is
  an ``OUTPUT`` of another custom command in the same directory
  (``CMakeLists.txt`` file) CMake automatically brings the other
  custom command into the target in which this command is built.
  If ``DEPENDS`` is not specified the command will run whenever
  the ``OUTPUT`` is missing; if the command does not actually
  create the ``OUTPUT`` then the rule will always run.
  If ``DEPENDS`` specifies any target (created by the
  :command:`add_custom_target`, :command:`add_executable`, or
  :command:`add_library` command) a target-level dependency is
  created to make sure the target is built before any target
  using this custom command.  Additionally, if the target is an
  executable or library a file-level dependency is created to
  cause the custom command to re-run whenever the target is
  recompiled.

  Arguments to ``DEPENDS`` may use
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.

``COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS``
  Lists in ``COMMAND`` arguments will be expanded, including those
  created with
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`,
  allowing ``COMMAND`` arguments such as
  ``${CC} "-I$<JOIN:$<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>,;-I>" foo.cc``
  to be properly expanded.

``IMPLICIT_DEPENDS``
  Request scanning of implicit dependencies of an input file.
  The language given specifies the programming language whose
  corresponding dependency scanner should be used.
  Currently only ``C`` and ``CXX`` language scanners are supported.
  The language has to be specified for every file in the
  ``IMPLICIT_DEPENDS`` list.  Dependencies discovered from the
  scanning are added to those of the custom command at build time.
  Note that the ``IMPLICIT_DEPENDS`` option is currently supported
  only for Makefile generators and will be ignored by other generators.

``MAIN_DEPENDENCY``
  Specify the primary input source file to the command.  This is
  treated just like any value given to the ``DEPENDS`` option
  but also suggests to Visual Studio generators where to hang
  the custom command. Each source file may have at most one command
  specifying it as its main dependency. A compile command (i.e. for a
  library or an executable) counts as an implicit main dependency which
  gets silently overwritten by a custom command specification.

``OUTPUT``
  Specify the output files the command is expected to produce.
  If an output name is a relative path it will be interpreted
  relative to the build tree directory corresponding to the
  current source directory.
  Each output file will be marked with the :prop_sf:`GENERATED`
  source file property automatically.
  If the output of the custom command is not actually created
  as a file on disk it should be marked with the :prop_sf:`SYMBOLIC`
  source file property.

``USES_TERMINAL``
  The command will be given direct access to the terminal if possible.
  With the :generator:`Ninja` generator, this places the command in
  the ``console`` :prop_gbl:`pool <JOB_POOLS>`.

``VERBATIM``
  All arguments to the commands will be escaped properly for the
  build tool so that the invoked command receives each argument
  unchanged.  Note that one level of escapes is still used by the
  CMake language processor before add_custom_command even sees the
  arguments.  Use of ``VERBATIM`` is recommended as it enables
  correct behavior.  When ``VERBATIM`` is not given the behavior
  is platform specific because there is no protection of
  tool-specific special characters.

``WORKING_DIRECTORY``
  Execute the command with the given current working directory.
  If it is a relative path it will be interpreted relative to the
  build tree directory corresponding to the current source directory.

``DEPFILE``
  Specify a ``.d`` depfile for the :generator:`Ninja` generator.
  A ``.d`` file holds dependencies usually emitted by the custom
  command itself.
  Using ``DEPFILE`` with other generators than Ninja is an error.

Build Events
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The second signature adds a custom command to a target such as a
library or executable.  This is useful for performing an operation
before or after building the target.  The command becomes part of the
target and will only execute when the target itself is built.  If the
target is already built, the command will not execute.

::

  add_custom_command(TARGET <target>
                     PRE_BUILD | PRE_LINK | POST_BUILD
                     COMMAND command1 [ARGS] [args1...]
                     [COMMAND command2 [ARGS] [args2...] ...]
                     [BYPRODUCTS [files...]]
                     [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                     [COMMENT comment]
                     [VERBATIM] [USES_TERMINAL])

This defines a new command that will be associated with building the
specified ``<target>``.  The ``<target>`` must be defined in the current
directory; targets defined in other directories may not be specified.

When the command will happen is determined by which
of the following is specified:

``PRE_BUILD``
  On :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`, run before any other rules are
  executed within the target.
  On other generators, run just before ``PRE_LINK`` commands.
``PRE_LINK``
  Run after sources have been compiled but before linking the binary
  or running the librarian or archiver tool of a static library.
  This is not defined for targets created by the
  :command:`add_custom_target` command.
``POST_BUILD``
  Run after all other rules within the target have been executed.

.. note::
  Because generator expressions can be used in custom commands,
  it is possible to define ``COMMAND`` lines or whole custom commands
  which evaluate to empty strings for certain configurations.
  For **Visual Studio 2010 (and newer)** generators these command
  lines or custom commands will be omitted for the specific
  configuration and no "empty-string-command" will be added.

  This allows to add individual build events for every configuration.
mark_as_advanced
----------------

Mark cmake cached variables as advanced.

::

  mark_as_advanced([CLEAR|FORCE] VAR [VAR2 ...])

Mark the named cached variables as advanced.  An advanced variable
will not be displayed in any of the cmake GUIs unless the show
advanced option is on.  If ``CLEAR`` is the first argument advanced
variables are changed back to unadvanced.  If ``FORCE`` is the first
argument, then the variable is made advanced.  If neither ``FORCE`` nor
``CLEAR`` is specified, new values will be marked as advanced, but if the
variable already has an advanced/non-advanced state, it will not be
changed.

It does nothing in script mode.
ctest_test
----------

Perform the :ref:`CTest Test Step` as a :ref:`Dashboard Client`.

::

  ctest_test([BUILD <build-dir>] [APPEND]
             [START <start-number>]
             [END <end-number>]
             [STRIDE <stride-number>]
             [EXCLUDE <exclude-regex>]
             [INCLUDE <include-regex>]
             [EXCLUDE_LABEL <label-exclude-regex>]
             [INCLUDE_LABEL <label-include-regex>]
             [EXCLUDE_FIXTURE <regex>]
             [EXCLUDE_FIXTURE_SETUP <regex>]
             [EXCLUDE_FIXTURE_CLEANUP <regex>]
             [PARALLEL_LEVEL <level>]
             [TEST_LOAD <threshold>]
             [SCHEDULE_RANDOM <ON|OFF>]
             [STOP_TIME <time-of-day>]
             [RETURN_VALUE <result-var>]
             [CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>]
             [QUIET]
             )

Run tests in the project build tree and store results in
``Test.xml`` for submission with the :command:`ctest_submit` command.

The options are:

``BUILD <build-dir>``
  Specify the top-level build directory.  If not given, the
  :variable:`CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY` variable is used.

``APPEND``
  Mark ``Test.xml`` for append to results previously submitted to a
  dashboard server since the last :command:`ctest_start` call.
  Append semantics are defined by the dashboard server in use.
  This does *not* cause results to be appended to a ``.xml`` file
  produced by a previous call to this command.

``START <start-number>``
  Specify the beginning of a range of test numbers.

``END <end-number>``
  Specify the end of a range of test numbers.

``STRIDE <stride-number>``
  Specify the stride by which to step across a range of test numbers.

``EXCLUDE <exclude-regex>``
  Specify a regular expression matching test names to exclude.

``INCLUDE <include-regex>``
  Specify a regular expression matching test names to include.
  Tests not matching this expression are excluded.

``EXCLUDE_LABEL <label-exclude-regex>``
  Specify a regular expression matching test labels to exclude.

``INCLUDE_LABEL <label-include-regex>``
  Specify a regular expression matching test labels to include.
  Tests not matching this expression are excluded.

``EXCLUDE_FIXTURE <regex>``
  If a test in the set of tests to be executed requires a particular fixture,
  that fixture's setup and cleanup tests would normally be added to the test
  set automatically. This option prevents adding setup or cleanup tests for
  fixtures matching the ``<regex>``. Note that all other fixture behavior is
  retained, including test dependencies and skipping tests that have fixture
  setup tests that fail.

``EXCLUDE_FIXTURE_SETUP <regex>``
  Same as ``EXCLUDE_FIXTURE`` except only matching setup tests are excluded.

``EXCLUDE_FIXTURE_CLEANUP <regex>``
  Same as ``EXCLUDE_FIXTURE`` except only matching cleanup tests are excluded.

``PARALLEL_LEVEL <level>``
  Specify a positive number representing the number of tests to
  be run in parallel.

``TEST_LOAD <threshold>``
  While running tests in parallel, try not to start tests when they
  may cause the CPU load to pass above a given threshold.  If not
  specified the :variable:`CTEST_TEST_LOAD` variable will be checked,
  and then the ``--test-load`` command-line argument to :manual:`ctest(1)`.
  See also the ``TestLoad`` setting in the :ref:`CTest Test Step`.

``SCHEDULE_RANDOM <ON|OFF>``
  Launch tests in a random order.  This may be useful for detecting
  implicit test dependencies.

``STOP_TIME <time-of-day>``
  Specify a time of day at which the tests should all stop running.

``RETURN_VALUE <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable ``0`` if all tests passed.
  Store non-zero if anything went wrong.

``CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable -1 if there are any errors running
  the command and prevent ctest from returning non-zero if an error occurs.

``QUIET``
  Suppress any CTest-specific non-error messages that would have otherwise
  been printed to the console.  Output from the underlying test command is not
  affected.  Summary info detailing the percentage of passing tests is also
  unaffected by the ``QUIET`` option.

See also the :variable:`CTEST_CUSTOM_MAXIMUM_PASSED_TEST_OUTPUT_SIZE`
and :variable:`CTEST_CUSTOM_MAXIMUM_FAILED_TEST_OUTPUT_SIZE` variables.
ctest_memcheck
--------------

Perform the :ref:`CTest MemCheck Step` as a :ref:`Dashboard Client`.

::

  ctest_memcheck([BUILD <build-dir>] [APPEND]
                 [START <start-number>]

                 )


Run tests with a dynamic analysis tool and store results in
``MemCheck.xml`` for submission with the :command:`ctest_submit`
command.

Most options are the same as those for the :command:`ctest_test` command.

The options unique to this command are:

``DEFECT_COUNT <defect-count-var>``
  Store in the ``<defect-count-var>`` the number of defects found.
enable_testing
--------------

Enable testing for current directory and below.

::

  enable_testing()

Enables testing for this directory and below.  See also the
:command:`add_test` command.  Note that ctest expects to find a test file
in the build directory root.  Therefore, this command should be in the
source directory root.
ATTACHED_FILES
--------------

Attach a list of files to a dashboard submission.

Set this property to a list of files that will be encoded and
submitted to the dashboard as an addition to the test result.
PROCESSOR_AFFINITY
------------------

Set to a true value to ask CTest to launch the test process with CPU affinity
for a fixed set of processors.  If enabled and supported for the current
platform, CTest will choose a set of processors to place in the CPU affinity
mask when launching the test process.  The number of processors in the set is
determined by the :prop_test:`PROCESSORS` test property or the number of
processors available to CTest, whichever is smaller.  The set of processors
chosen will be disjoint from the processors assigned to other concurrently
running tests that also have the ``PROCESSOR_AFFINITY`` property enabled.
WORKING_DIRECTORY
-----------------

The directory from which the test executable will be called.

If this is not set, the test will be run with the working directory set to the
binary directory associated with where the test was created (i.e. the
:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` for where :command:`add_test` was
called).
FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
-----------------------

If the output matches this regular expression the test will fail.

If set, if the output matches one of specified regular expressions,
the test will fail.  Example:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set_tests_properties(mytest PROPERTIES
    FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "[^a-z]Error;ERROR;Failed"
  )

``FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`` expects a list of regular expressions.
RESOURCE_LOCK
-------------

Specify a list of resources that are locked by this test.

If multiple tests specify the same resource lock, they are guaranteed
not to run concurrently.

See also :prop_test:`FIXTURES_REQUIRED` if the resource requires any setup or
cleanup steps.
SKIP_RETURN_CODE
----------------

Return code to mark a test as skipped.

Sometimes only a test itself can determine if all requirements for the
test are met. If such a situation should not be considered a hard failure
a return code of the process can be specified that will mark the test as
"Not Run" if it is encountered.
FIXTURES_SETUP
--------------

Specifies a list of fixtures for which the test is to be treated as a setup
test. These fixture names are distinct from test case names and are not
required to have any similarity to the names of tests associated with them.

Fixture setup tests are ordinary tests with all of the usual test
functionality. Setting the ``FIXTURES_SETUP`` property for a test has two
primary effects:

- CTest will ensure the test executes before any other test which lists the
  fixture name(s) in its :prop_test:`FIXTURES_REQUIRED` property.

- If CTest is asked to run only a subset of tests (e.g. using regular
  expressions or the ``--rerun-failed`` option) and the setup test is not in
  the set of tests to run, it will automatically be added if any tests in the
  set require any fixture listed in ``FIXTURES_SETUP``.

A setup test can have multiple fixtures listed in its ``FIXTURES_SETUP``
property. It will execute only once for the whole CTest run, not once for each
fixture. A fixture can also have more than one setup test defined. If there are
multiple setup tests for a fixture, projects can control their order with the
usual :prop_test:`DEPENDS` test property if necessary.

A setup test is allowed to require other fixtures, but not any fixture listed
in its ``FIXTURES_SETUP`` property. For example:

.. code-block:: cmake

  # Ok: dependent fixture is different to setup
  set_tests_properties(setupFoo PROPERTIES
    FIXTURES_SETUP    Foo
    FIXTURES_REQUIRED Bar
  )

  # Error: cannot require same fixture as setup
  set_tests_properties(setupFoo PROPERTIES
    FIXTURES_SETUP    Foo
    FIXTURES_REQUIRED Foo
  )

If any of a fixture's setup tests fail, none of the tests listing that fixture
in its :prop_test:`FIXTURES_REQUIRED` property will be run. Cleanup tests will,
however, still be executed.

See :prop_test:`FIXTURES_REQUIRED` for a more complete discussion of how to use
test fixtures.
ATTACHED_FILES_ON_FAIL
----------------------

Attach a list of files to a dashboard submission if the test fails.

Same as :prop_test:`ATTACHED_FILES`, but these files will only be
included if the test does not pass.
FIXTURES_REQUIRED
-----------------

Specifies a list of fixtures the test requires. Fixture names are case
sensitive and they are not required to have any similarity to test names.

Fixtures are a way to attach setup and cleanup tasks to a set of tests. If a
test requires a given fixture, then all tests marked as setup tasks for that
fixture will be executed first (once for the whole set of tests, not once per
test requiring the fixture). After all tests requiring a particular fixture
have completed, CTest will ensure all tests marked as cleanup tasks for that
fixture are then executed. Tests are marked as setup tasks with the
:prop_test:`FIXTURES_SETUP` property and as cleanup tasks with the
:prop_test:`FIXTURES_CLEANUP` property. If any of a fixture's setup tests fail,
all tests listing that fixture in their ``FIXTURES_REQUIRED`` property will not
be executed. The cleanup tests for the fixture will always be executed, even if
some setup tests fail.

When CTest is asked to execute only a subset of tests (e.g. by the use of
regular expressions or when run with the ``--rerun-failed`` command line
option), it will automatically add any setup or cleanup tests for fixtures
required by any of the tests that are in the execution set. This behavior can
be overridden with the ``-FS``, ``-FC`` and ``-FA`` command line options to
:manual:`ctest(1)` if desired.

Since setup and cleanup tasks are also tests, they can have an ordering
specified by the :prop_test:`DEPENDS` test property just like any other tests.
This can be exploited to implement setup or cleanup using multiple tests for a
single fixture to modularise setup or cleanup logic.

The concept of a fixture is different to that of a resource specified by
:prop_test:`RESOURCE_LOCK`, but they may be used together. A fixture defines a
set of tests which share setup and cleanup requirements, whereas a resource
lock has the effect of ensuring a particular set of tests do not run in
parallel. Some situations may need both, such as setting up a database,
serialising test access to that database and deleting the database again at the
end. For such cases, tests would populate both ``FIXTURES_REQUIRED`` and
:prop_test:`RESOURCE_LOCK` to combine the two behaviours. Names used for
:prop_test:`RESOURCE_LOCK` have no relationship with names of fixtures, so note
that a resource lock does not imply a fixture and vice versa.

Consider the following example which represents a database test scenario
similar to that mentioned above:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_test(NAME testsDone   COMMAND emailResults)
  add_test(NAME fooOnly     COMMAND testFoo)
  add_test(NAME dbOnly      COMMAND testDb)
  add_test(NAME dbWithFoo   COMMAND testDbWithFoo)
  add_test(NAME createDB    COMMAND initDB)
  add_test(NAME setupUsers  COMMAND userCreation)
  add_test(NAME cleanupDB   COMMAND deleteDB)
  add_test(NAME cleanupFoo  COMMAND removeFoos)

  set_tests_properties(setupUsers PROPERTIES DEPENDS createDB)

  set_tests_properties(createDB   PROPERTIES FIXTURES_SETUP    DB)
  set_tests_properties(setupUsers PROPERTIES FIXTURES_SETUP    DB)
  set_tests_properties(cleanupDB  PROPERTIES FIXTURES_CLEANUP  DB)
  set_tests_properties(cleanupFoo PROPERTIES FIXTURES_CLEANUP  Foo)
  set_tests_properties(testsDone  PROPERTIES FIXTURES_CLEANUP  "DB;Foo")

  set_tests_properties(fooOnly    PROPERTIES FIXTURES_REQUIRED Foo)
  set_tests_properties(dbOnly     PROPERTIES FIXTURES_REQUIRED DB)
  set_tests_properties(dbWithFoo  PROPERTIES FIXTURES_REQUIRED "DB;Foo")

  set_tests_properties(dbOnly dbWithFoo createDB setupUsers cleanupDB
                       PROPERTIES RESOURCE_LOCK DbAccess)

Key points from this example:

- Two fixtures are defined: ``DB`` and ``Foo``. Tests can require a single
  fixture as ``fooOnly`` and ``dbOnly`` do, or they can depend on multiple
  fixtures like ``dbWithFoo`` does.

- A ``DEPENDS`` relationship is set up to ensure ``setupUsers`` happens after
  ``createDB``, both of which are setup tests for the ``DB`` fixture and will
  therefore be executed before the ``dbOnly`` and ``dbWithFoo`` tests
  automatically.

- No explicit ``DEPENDS`` relationships were needed to make the setup tests run
  before or the cleanup tests run after the regular tests.

- The ``Foo`` fixture has no setup tests defined, only a single cleanup test.

- ``testsDone`` is a cleanup test for both the ``DB`` and ``Foo`` fixtures.
  Therefore, it will only execute once regular tests for both fixtures have
  finished (i.e. after ``fooOnly``, ``dbOnly`` and ``dbWithFoo``). No
  ``DEPENDS`` relationship was specified for ``testsDone``, so it is free to
  run before, after or concurrently with other cleanup tests for either
  fixture.

- The setup and cleanup tests never list the fixtures they are for in their own
  ``FIXTURES_REQUIRED`` property, as that would result in a dependency on
  themselves and be considered an error.
PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
-----------------------

The output must match this regular expression for the test to pass.

If set, the test output will be checked against the specified regular
expressions and at least one of the regular expressions has to match,
otherwise the test will fail.  Example:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set_tests_properties(mytest PROPERTIES
    PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "TestPassed;All ok"
  )

``PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`` expects a list of regular expressions.
COST
----

Set this to a floating point value. Tests in a test set will be run in descending order of cost.

This property describes the cost of a test.  You can explicitly set
this value; tests with higher COST values will run first.
RUN_SERIAL
----------

Do not run this test in parallel with any other test.

Use this option in conjunction with the ctest_test PARALLEL_LEVEL
option to specify that this test should not be run in parallel with
any other tests.
FIXTURES_CLEANUP
----------------

Specifies a list of fixtures for which the test is to be treated as a cleanup
test. These fixture names are distinct from test case names and are not
required to have any similarity to the names of tests associated with them.

Fixture cleanup tests are ordinary tests with all of the usual test
functionality. Setting the ``FIXTURES_CLEANUP`` property for a test has two
primary effects:

- CTest will ensure the test executes after all other tests which list any of
  the fixtures in its :prop_test:`FIXTURES_REQUIRED` property.

- If CTest is asked to run only a subset of tests (e.g. using regular
  expressions or the ``--rerun-failed`` option) and the cleanup test is not in
  the set of tests to run, it will automatically be added if any tests in the
  set require any fixture listed in ``FIXTURES_CLEANUP``.

A cleanup test can have multiple fixtures listed in its ``FIXTURES_CLEANUP``
property. It will execute only once for the whole CTest run, not once for each
fixture. A fixture can also have more than one cleanup test defined. If there
are multiple cleanup tests for a fixture, projects can control their order with
the usual :prop_test:`DEPENDS` test property if necessary.

A cleanup test is allowed to require other fixtures, but not any fixture listed
in its ``FIXTURES_CLEANUP`` property. For example:

.. code-block:: cmake

  # Ok: Dependent fixture is different to cleanup
  set_tests_properties(cleanupFoo PROPERTIES
    FIXTURES_CLEANUP  Foo
    FIXTURES_REQUIRED Bar
  )

  # Error: cannot require same fixture as cleanup
  set_tests_properties(cleanupFoo PROPERTIES
    FIXTURES_CLEANUP  Foo
    FIXTURES_REQUIRED Foo
  )

Cleanup tests will execute even if setup or regular tests for that fixture fail
or are skipped.

See :prop_test:`FIXTURES_REQUIRED` for a more complete discussion of how to use
test fixtures.
PROCESSORS
----------

Set to specify how many process slots this test requires.
If not set, the default is ``1`` processor.

Denotes the number of processors that this test will require.  This is
typically used for MPI tests, and should be used in conjunction with
the :command:`ctest_test` ``PARALLEL_LEVEL`` option.

This will also be used to display a weighted test timing result in label and
subproject summaries in the command line output of :manual:`ctest(1)`. The wall
clock time for the test run will be multiplied by this property to give a
better idea of how much cpu resource CTest allocated for the test.

See also the :prop_test:`PROCESSOR_AFFINITY` test property.
TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH
-------------------

Change a test's timeout duration after a matching line is encountered
in its output.

Usage
^^^^^

.. code-block:: cmake

 add_test(mytest ...)
 set_property(TEST mytest PROPERTY TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH "${seconds}" "${regex}")

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

Allow a test ``seconds`` to complete after ``regex`` is encountered in
its output.

When the test outputs a line that matches ``regex`` its start time is
reset to the current time and its timeout duration is changed to
``seconds``.  Prior to this, the timeout duration is determined by the
:prop_test:`TIMEOUT` property or the :variable:`CTEST_TEST_TIMEOUT`
variable if either of these are set.  Because the test's start time is
reset, its execution time will not include any time that was spent
waiting for the matching output.

:prop_test:`TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH` is useful for avoiding spurious
timeouts when your test must wait for some system resource to become
available before it can execute.  Set :prop_test:`TIMEOUT` to a longer
duration that accounts for resource acquisition and use
:prop_test:`TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH` to control how long the actual test
is allowed to run.

If the required resource can be controlled by CTest you should use
:prop_test:`RESOURCE_LOCK` instead of :prop_test:`TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH`.
This property should be used when only the test itself can determine
when its required resources are available.
TIMEOUT
-------

How many seconds to allow for this test.

This property if set will limit a test to not take more than the
specified number of seconds to run.  If it exceeds that the test
process will be killed and ctest will move to the next test.  This
setting takes precedence over :variable:`CTEST_TEST_TIMEOUT`.
DISABLED
--------

If set to true, the test will be skipped and its status will be 'Not Run'. A
DISABLED test will not be counted in the total number of tests and its
completion status will be reported to CDash as 'Disabled'.

A DISABLED test does not participate in test fixture dependency resolution.
If a DISABLED test has fixture requirements defined in its
:prop_test:`FIXTURES_REQUIRED` property, it will not cause setup or cleanup
tests for those fixtures to be added to the test set.

If a test with the :prop_test:`FIXTURES_SETUP` property set is DISABLED, the
fixture behavior will be as though that setup test was passing and any test
case requiring that fixture will still run.
WILL_FAIL
---------

If set to true, this will invert the pass/fail flag of the test.

This property can be used for tests that are expected to fail and
return a non zero return code.
MEASUREMENT
-----------

Specify a CDASH measurement and value to be reported for a test.

If set to a name then that name will be reported to CDASH as a named
measurement with a value of 1.  You may also specify a value by
setting MEASUREMENT to "measurement=value".
LABELS
------

Specify a list of text labels associated with a test.

The list is reported in dashboard submissions.
ENVIRONMENT
-----------

Specify environment variables that should be defined for running a test.

If set to a list of environment variables and values of the form
MYVAR=value those environment variables will be defined while running
the test.  The environment is restored to its previous state after the
test is done.
REQUIRED_FILES
--------------

List of files required to run the test.

If set to a list of files, the test will not be run unless all of the
files exist.
DEPENDS
-------

Specifies that this test should only be run after the specified list of tests.

Set this to a list of tests that must finish before this test is run. The
results of those tests are not considered, the dependency relationship is
purely for order of execution (i.e. it is really just a *run after*
relationship). Consider using test fixtures with setup tests if a dependency
with successful completion is required (see :prop_test:`FIXTURES_REQUIRED`).
PREDEFINED_TARGETS_FOLDER
-------------------------

Name of FOLDER for targets that are added automatically by CMake.

If not set, CMake uses "CMakePredefinedTargets" as a default value for
this property.  Targets such as INSTALL, PACKAGE and RUN_TESTS will be
organized into this FOLDER.  See also the documentation for the
:prop_tgt:`FOLDER` target property.
AUTOMOC_SOURCE_GROUP
--------------------

Name of the  :command:`source_group` for :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` generated files.

When set this is used instead of :prop_gbl:`AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP` for
files generated by :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC`.
ENABLED_LANGUAGES
-----------------

Read-only property that contains the list of currently enabled languages

Set to list of currently enabled languages.
DISABLED_FEATURES
-----------------

List of features which are disabled during the CMake run.

List of features which are disabled during the CMake run.  By default
it contains the names of all packages which were not found.  This is
determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.  Packages which are
searched QUIET are not listed.  A project can add its own features to
this list.  This property is used by the macros in
FeatureSummary.cmake.
FIND_LIBRARY_USE_OPENBSD_VERSIONING
-----------------------------------

Whether :command:`find_library` should find OpenBSD-style shared
libraries.

This property is a boolean specifying whether the
:command:`find_library` command should find shared libraries with
OpenBSD-style versioned extension: ".so.<major>.<minor>".  The
property is set to true on OpenBSD and false on other platforms.
RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
----------------

Specify a launcher for link rules.

:ref:`Makefile Generators` and the :generator:`Ninja` generator prefix
link and archive commands with the given launcher command line.
This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build problems
with high granularity.  Other generators ignore this property
because their underlying build systems provide no hook to wrap
individual commands with a launcher.
REPORT_UNDEFINED_PROPERTIES
---------------------------

If set, report any undefined properties to this file.

If this property is set to a filename then when CMake runs it will
report any properties or variables that were accessed but not defined
into the filename specified in this property.
IN_TRY_COMPILE
--------------

Read-only property that is true during a try-compile configuration.

True when building a project inside a :command:`try_compile` or
:command:`try_run` command.
CMAKE_CXX_KNOWN_FEATURES
------------------------

List of C++ features known to this version of CMake.

The features listed in this global property may be known to be available to the
C++ compiler.  If the feature is available with the C++ compiler, it will
be listed in the :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILE_FEATURES` variable.

The features listed here may be used with the :command:`target_compile_features`
command.  See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

``cxx_template_template_parameters``
  Template template parameters, as defined in ``ISO/IEC 14882:1998``.
AUTORCC_SOURCE_GROUP
--------------------

Name of the  :command:`source_group` for :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC` generated files.

When set this is used instead of :prop_gbl:`AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP` for
files generated by :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC`.
XCODE_EMIT_EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME
----------------------------------

Control emission of ``EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME`` by the Xcode generator.

It is required for building the same target with multiple SDKs. A
common use case is the parallel use of ``iphoneos`` and
``iphonesimulator`` SDKs.

Three different states possible that control when the Xcode generator
emits the ``EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME`` variable:

- If set to ``ON`` it will always be emitted
- If set to ``OFF`` it will never be emitted
- If unset (the default) it will only be emitted when the project was
  configured for an embedded Xcode SDK like iOS, tvOS, watchOS or any
  of the simulators.

.. note::

  When this behavior is enable for generated Xcode projects, the
  ``EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME`` variable will leak into
  :manual:`Generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
  like ``TARGET_FILE`` and will render those mostly unusable.
AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER
----------------------

Name of :prop_tgt:`FOLDER` for ``*_autogen`` targets that are added
automatically by CMake for targets for which :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` is enabled.

If not set, CMake uses the :prop_tgt:`FOLDER` property of the parent target as a
default value for this property.  See also the documentation for the
:prop_tgt:`FOLDER` target property and the :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` target property.
DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS
--------------------

Specify which configurations are for debugging.

The value must be a semi-colon separated list of configuration names.
Currently this property is used only by the :command:`target_link_libraries`
command.  Additional uses may be defined in the future.

This property must be set at the top level of the project and before
the first :command:`target_link_libraries` command invocation.  If any entry in
the list does not match a valid configuration for the project the
behavior is undefined.
ECLIPSE_EXTRA_CPROJECT_CONTENTS
-------------------------------

Additional contents to be inserted into the generated Eclipse cproject file.

The cproject file defines the CDT specific information. Some third party IDE's
are based on Eclipse with the addition of other information specific to that IDE.
Through this property, it is possible to add this additional contents to
the generated project.
It is expected to contain valid XML.

Also see the :prop_gbl:`ECLIPSE_EXTRA_NATURES` property.
GLOBAL_DEPENDS_DEBUG_MODE
-------------------------

Enable global target dependency graph debug mode.

CMake automatically analyzes the global inter-target dependency graph
at the beginning of native build system generation.  This property
causes it to display details of its analysis to stderr.
USE_FOLDERS
-----------

Use the :prop_tgt:`FOLDER` target property to organize targets into
folders.

If not set, CMake treats this property as OFF by default.  CMake
generators that are capable of organizing into a hierarchy of folders
use the values of the :prop_tgt:`FOLDER` target property to name those
folders. See also the documentation for the FOLDER target property.
GLOBAL_DEPENDS_NO_CYCLES
------------------------

Disallow global target dependency graph cycles.

CMake automatically analyzes the global inter-target dependency graph
at the beginning of native build system generation.  It reports an
error if the dependency graph contains a cycle that does not consist
of all STATIC library targets.  This property tells CMake to disallow
all cycles completely, even among static libraries.
PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND
------------------

List of packages which were not found during the CMake run.

List of packages which were not found during the CMake run.  Whether a
package has been found is determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.
JOB_POOLS
---------

Ninja only: List of available pools.

A pool is a named integer property and defines the maximum number
of concurrent jobs which can be started by a rule assigned to the pool.
The :prop_gbl:`JOB_POOLS` property is a semicolon-separated list of
pairs using the syntax NAME=integer (without a space after the equality sign).

For instance:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set_property(GLOBAL PROPERTY JOB_POOLS two_jobs=2 ten_jobs=10)

Defined pools could be used globally by setting
:variable:`CMAKE_JOB_POOL_COMPILE` and :variable:`CMAKE_JOB_POOL_LINK`
or per target by setting the target properties
:prop_tgt:`JOB_POOL_COMPILE` and :prop_tgt:`JOB_POOL_LINK`.

If not set, this property uses the value of the :variable:`CMAKE_JOB_POOLS`
variable.

Build targets provided by CMake that are meant for individual interactive
use, such as ``install``, are placed in the ``console`` pool automatically.
GENERATOR_IS_MULTI_CONFIG
-------------------------

Read-only property that is true on multi-configuration generators.

True when using a multi-configuration generator
(such as :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` or :generator:`Xcode`).
Multi-config generators use :variable:`CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES`
as the set of configurations and ignore :variable:`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`.
RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
-------------------

Specify a launcher for compile rules.

:ref:`Makefile Generators` and the :generator:`Ninja` generator prefix
compiler commands with the given launcher command line.
This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build problems
with high granularity.  Other generators ignore this property
because their underlying build systems provide no hook to wrap
individual commands with a launcher.
PACKAGES_FOUND
--------------

List of packages which were found during the CMake run.

List of packages which were found during the CMake run.  Whether a
package has been found is determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.
FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS
----------------------------

Whether the :command:`find_library` command should automatically search
``lib32`` directories.

``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS`` is a boolean specifying whether the
:command:`find_library` command should automatically search the ``lib32``
variant of directories called ``lib`` in the search path when building 32-bit
binaries.

See also the :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX` variable.
CMAKE_C_KNOWN_FEATURES
----------------------

List of C features known to this version of CMake.

The features listed in this global property may be known to be available to the
C compiler.  If the feature is available with the C compiler, it will
be listed in the :variable:`CMAKE_C_COMPILE_FEATURES` variable.

The features listed here may be used with the :command:`target_compile_features`
command.  See the :manual:`cmake-compile-features(7)` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

The features known to this version of CMake are:

``c_std_90``
  Compiler mode is aware of C 90.

``c_std_99``
  Compiler mode is aware of C 99.

``c_std_11``
  Compiler mode is aware of C 11.

``c_function_prototypes``
  Function prototypes, as defined in ``ISO/IEC 9899:1990``.

``c_restrict``
  ``restrict`` keyword, as defined in ``ISO/IEC 9899:1999``.

``c_static_assert``
  Static assert, as defined in ``ISO/IEC 9899:2011``.

``c_variadic_macros``
  Variadic macros, as defined in ``ISO/IEC 9899:1999``.
RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
------------------

Specify a launcher for custom rules.

:ref:`Makefile Generators` and the :generator:`Ninja` generator prefix
custom commands with the given launcher command line.
This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build problems
with high granularity.  Other generators ignore this property
because their underlying build systems provide no hook to wrap
individual commands with a launcher.
TARGET_MESSAGES
---------------

Specify whether to report the completion of each target.

This property specifies whether :ref:`Makefile Generators` should
add a progress message describing that each target has been completed.
If the property is not set the default is ``ON``.  Set the property
to ``OFF`` to disable target completion messages.

This option is intended to reduce build output when little or no
work needs to be done to bring the build tree up to date.

If a ``CMAKE_TARGET_MESSAGES`` cache entry exists its value
initializes the value of this property.

Non-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.

See the counterpart property :prop_gbl:`RULE_MESSAGES` to disable
everything except for target completion messages.
ENABLED_FEATURES
----------------

List of features which are enabled during the CMake run.

List of features which are enabled during the CMake run.  By default
it contains the names of all packages which were found.  This is
determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.  Packages which are
searched QUIET are not listed.  A project can add its own features to
this list.  This property is used by the macros in
FeatureSummary.cmake.
ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS
------------------------------

Allow duplicate custom targets to be created.

Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a project have
globally unique logical names (see policy CMP0002).  This is necessary
to generate meaningful project file names in Xcode and VS IDE
generators.  It also allows the target names to be referenced
unambiguously.

Makefile generators are capable of supporting duplicate custom target
names.  For projects that care only about Makefile generators and do
not wish to support Xcode or VS IDE generators, one may set this
property to true to allow duplicate custom targets.  The property
allows multiple add_custom_target command calls in different
directories to specify the same target name.  However, setting this
property will cause non-Makefile generators to produce an error and
refuse to generate the project.
ECLIPSE_EXTRA_NATURES
---------------------

List of natures to add to the generated Eclipse project file.

Eclipse projects specify language plugins by using natures. This property
should be set to the unique identifier for a nature (which looks like a Java
package name).

Also see the :prop_gbl:`ECLIPSE_EXTRA_CPROJECT_CONTENTS` property.
TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS
---------------------------

Does the target platform support shared libraries.

TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS is a boolean specifying whether the target
platform supports shared libraries.  Basically all current general
general purpose OS do so, the exception are usually embedded systems
with no or special OSs.
RULE_MESSAGES
-------------

Specify whether to report a message for each make rule.

This property specifies whether Makefile generators should add a
progress message describing what each build rule does.  If the
property is not set the default is ON.  Set the property to OFF to
disable granular messages and report only as each target completes.
This is intended to allow scripted builds to avoid the build time cost
of detailed reports.  If a ``CMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES`` cache entry exists
its value initializes the value of this property.  Non-Makefile
generators currently ignore this property.
AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP
--------------------

Name of the  :command:`source_group` for :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and
:prop_tgt:`AUTORCC` generated files.

Files generated by :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC` are not always
known at configure time and therefore can't be passed to
:command:`source_group`.
:prop_gbl:`AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP` an be used instead to generate or select
a source group for :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC` generated files.

For :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC` specific overrides see
:prop_gbl:`AUTOMOC_SOURCE_GROUP` and :prop_gbl:`AUTORCC_SOURCE_GROUP`
respectively.
FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS
----------------------------

Whether :command:`find_library` should automatically search lib64
directories.

FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS is a boolean specifying whether the
:command:`find_library` command should automatically search the lib64
variant of directories called lib in the search path when building
64-bit binaries.

See also the :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX` variable.
AUTOMOC_TARGETS_FOLDER
----------------------

Name of :prop_tgt:`FOLDER` for ``*_autogen`` targets that are added automatically by
CMake for targets for which :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` is enabled.

This property is obsolete.  Use :prop_gbl:`AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER` instead.

If not set, CMake uses the :prop_tgt:`FOLDER` property of the parent target as a
default value for this property.  See also the documentation for the
:prop_tgt:`FOLDER` target property and the :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` target property.
FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS
-----------------------------

Whether the :command:`find_library` command should automatically search
``libx32`` directories.

``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS`` is a boolean specifying whether the
:command:`find_library` command should automatically search the ``libx32``
variant of directories called ``lib`` in the search path when building
x32-abi binaries.

See also the :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX` variable.
TARGET_ARCHIVES_MAY_BE_SHARED_LIBS
----------------------------------

Set if shared libraries may be named like archives.

On AIX shared libraries may be named "lib<name>.a".  This property is
set to true on such platforms.

HELPSTRING
----------

Help associated with entry in GUIs.

This string summarizes the purpose of an entry to help users set it
through a CMake GUI.
VALUE
-----

Value of a cache entry.

This property maps to the actual value of a cache entry.  Setting this
property always sets the value without checking, so use with care.
STRINGS
-------

Enumerate possible STRING entry values for GUI selection.

For cache entries with type STRING, this enumerates a set of values.
CMake GUIs may use this to provide a selection widget instead of a
generic string entry field.  This is for convenience only.  CMake does
not enforce that the value matches one of those listed.
TYPE
----

Widget type for entry in GUIs.

Cache entry values are always strings, but CMake GUIs present widgets
to help users set values.  The GUIs use this property as a hint to
determine the widget type.  Valid TYPE values are:

::

  BOOL          = Boolean ON/OFF value.
  PATH          = Path to a directory.
  FILEPATH      = Path to a file.
  STRING        = Generic string value.
  INTERNAL      = Do not present in GUI at all.
  STATIC        = Value managed by CMake, do not change.
  UNINITIALIZED = Type not yet specified.

Generally the TYPE of a cache entry should be set by the command which
creates it (set, option, find_library, etc.).
MODIFIED
--------

Internal management property.  Do not set or get.

This is an internal cache entry property managed by CMake to track
interactive user modification of entries.  Ignore it.
ADVANCED
--------

True if entry should be hidden by default in GUIs.

This is a boolean value indicating whether the entry is considered
interesting only for advanced configuration.  The mark_as_advanced()
command modifies this property.
CPACK_DESKTOP_SHORTCUTS
-----------------------

Species a list of shortcut names that should be created on the Desktop
for this file.

The property is currently only supported by the WIX generator.
CPACK_START_MENU_SHORTCUTS
--------------------------

Species a list of shortcut names that should be created in the Start Menu
for this file.

The property is currently only supported by the WIX generator.
CPACK_STARTUP_SHORTCUTS
-----------------------

Species a list of shortcut names that should be created in the Startup folder
for this file.

The property is currently only supported by the WIX generator.
CPACK_PERMANENT
---------------

Request that this file not be removed on uninstall.

The property is currently only supported by the WIX generator.
CPACK_WIX_ACL
-------------

Specifies access permissions for files or directories
installed by a WiX installer.

The property can contain multiple list entries,
each of which has to match the following format.

::

  <user>[@<domain>]=<permission>[,<permission>]

``<user>`` and ``<domain>`` specify the windows user and domain for which the
``<Permission>`` element should be generated.

``<permission>`` is any of the YesNoType attributes listed here::

 http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/xsd/wix/permission.html
CPACK_NEVER_OVERWRITE
---------------------

Request that this file not be overwritten on install or reinstall.

The property is currently only supported by the WIX generator.
UNKNOWN


===============================
Installing and Using Setuptools
===============================

.. contents:: **Table of Contents**


`Change History <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/history.html>`_.

-------------------------
Installation Instructions
-------------------------

The recommended way to bootstrap setuptools on any system is to download
`ez_setup.py`_ and run it using the target Python environment. Different
operating systems have different recommended techniques to accomplish this
basic routine, so below are some examples to get you started.

Setuptools requires Python 2.6 or later. To install setuptools
on Python 2.4 or Python 2.5, use the `bootstrap script for Setuptools 1.x
<https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap-py24/ez_setup.py>`_.

The link provided to ez_setup.py is a bookmark to bootstrap script for the
latest known stable release.

.. _ez_setup.py: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py

Windows (Powershell 3 or later)
===============================

For best results, uninstall previous versions FIRST (see `Uninstalling`_).

Using Windows 8 (which includes PowerShell 3) or earlier versions of Windows
with PowerShell 3 installed, it's possible to install with one simple
Powershell command. Start up Powershell and paste this command::

    > (Invoke-WebRequest https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py).Content | python -

You must start the Powershell with Administrative privileges or you may choose
to install a user-local installation::

    > (Invoke-WebRequest https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py).Content | python - --user

If you have Python 3.3 or later, you can use the ``py`` command to install to
different Python versions. For example, to install to Python 3.3 if you have
Python 2.7 installed::

    > (Invoke-WebRequest https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py).Content | py -3 -

The recommended way to install setuptools on Windows is to download
`ez_setup.py`_ and run it. The script will download the appropriate
distribution file and install it for you.

Once installation is complete, you will find an ``easy_install`` program in
your Python ``Scripts`` subdirectory.  For simple invocation and best results,
add this directory to your ``PATH`` environment variable, if it is not already
present. If you did a user-local install, the ``Scripts`` subdirectory is
``$env:APPDATA\Python\Scripts``.


Windows (simplified)
====================

For Windows without PowerShell 3 or for installation without a command-line,
download `ez_setup.py`_ using your preferred web browser or other technique
and "run" that file.


Unix (wget)
===========

Most Linux distributions come with wget.

Download `ez_setup.py`_ and run it using the target Python version. The script
will download the appropriate version and install it for you::

    > wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -O - | python

Note that you will may need to invoke the command with superuser privileges to
install to the system Python::

    > wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -O - | sudo python

Alternatively, Setuptools may be installed to a user-local path::

    > wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -O - | python - --user

Note that on some older systems (noted on Debian 6 and CentOS 5 installations),
`wget` may refuse to download `ez_setup.py`, complaining that the certificate common name `*.c.ssl.fastly.net`
does not match the host name `bootstrap.pypa.io`. In addition, the `ez_setup.py` script may then encounter similar problems using
`wget` internally to download `setuptools-x.y.zip`, complaining that the certificate common name of `www.python.org` does not match the
host name `pypi.python.org`. Those are known issues, related to a bug in the older versions of `wget`
(see `Issue 59 <https://bitbucket.org/pypa/pypi/issue/59#comment-5881915>`_). If you happen to encounter them,
install Setuptools as follows::

    > wget --no-check-certificate https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py
    > python ez_setup.py --insecure


Unix including Mac OS X (curl)
==============================

If your system has curl installed, follow the ``wget`` instructions but
replace ``wget`` with ``curl`` and ``-O`` with ``-o``. For example::

    > curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -o - | python


Advanced Installation
=====================

For more advanced installation options, such as installing to custom
locations or prefixes, download and extract the source
tarball from `Setuptools on PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_
and run setup.py with any supported distutils and Setuptools options.
For example::

    setuptools-x.x$ python setup.py install --prefix=/opt/setuptools

Use ``--help`` to get a full options list, but we recommend consulting
the `EasyInstall manual`_ for detailed instructions, especially `the section
on custom installation locations`_.

.. _EasyInstall manual: https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/EasyInstall
.. _the section on custom installation locations: https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/EasyInstall#custom-installation-locations


Downloads
=========

All setuptools downloads can be found at `the project's home page in the Python
Package Index`_.  Scroll to the very bottom of the page to find the links.

.. _the project's home page in the Python Package Index: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

In addition to the PyPI downloads, the development version of ``setuptools``
is available from the `Bitbucket repo`_, and in-development versions of the
`0.6 branch`_ are available as well.

.. _Bitbucket repo: https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/get/default.tar.gz#egg=setuptools-dev
.. _0.6 branch: http://svn.python.org/projects/sandbox/branches/setuptools-0.6/#egg=setuptools-dev06

Uninstalling
============

On Windows, if Setuptools was installed using an ``.exe`` or ``.msi``
installer, simply use the uninstall feature of "Add/Remove Programs" in the
Control Panel.

Otherwise, to uninstall Setuptools or Distribute, regardless of the Python
version, delete all ``setuptools*`` and ``distribute*`` files and
directories from your system's ``site-packages`` directory
(and any other ``sys.path`` directories) FIRST.

If you are upgrading or otherwise plan to re-install Setuptools or Distribute,
nothing further needs to be done. If you want to completely remove Setuptools,
you may also want to remove the 'easy_install' and 'easy_install-x.x' scripts
and associated executables installed to the Python scripts directory.

--------------------------------
Using Setuptools and EasyInstall
--------------------------------

Here are some of the available manuals, tutorials, and other resources for
learning about Setuptools, Python Eggs, and EasyInstall:

* `The EasyInstall user's guide and reference manual`_
* `The setuptools Developer's Guide`_
* `The pkg_resources API reference`_
* `The Internal Structure of Python Eggs`_

Questions, comments, and bug reports should be directed to the `distutils-sig
mailing list`_.  If you have written (or know of) any tutorials, documentation,
plug-ins, or other resources for setuptools users, please let us know about
them there, so this reference list can be updated.  If you have working,
*tested* patches to correct problems or add features, you may submit them to
the `setuptools bug tracker`_.

Credits
-------

* The original design for the ``.egg`` format and the ``pkg_resources`` API was
  co-created by Phillip Eby and Bob Ippolito.  Bob also implemented the first
  version of ``pkg_resources``, and supplied the OS X operating system version
  compatibility algorithm.

* Ian Bicking implemented many early "creature comfort" features of
  easy_install, including support for downloading via Sourceforge and
  Subversion repositories.  Ian's comments on the Web-SIG about WSGI
  application deployment also inspired the concept of "entry points" in eggs,
  and he has given talks at PyCon and elsewhere to inform and educate the
  community about eggs and setuptools.

* Jim Fulton contributed time and effort to build automated tests of various
  aspects of ``easy_install``, and supplied the doctests for the command-line
  ``.exe`` wrappers on Windows.

* Phillip J. Eby is the seminal author of setuptools, and
  first proposed the idea of an importable binary distribution format for
  Python application plug-ins.

* Significant parts of the implementation of setuptools were funded by the Open
  Source Applications Foundation, to provide a plug-in infrastructure for the
  Chandler PIM application.  In addition, many OSAF staffers (such as Mike
  "Code Bear" Taylor) contributed their time and stress as guinea pigs for the
  use of eggs and setuptools, even before eggs were "cool".  (Thanks, guys!)

* Tarek Ziadé is the principal author of the Distribute fork, which
  re-invigorated the community on the project, encouraged renewed innovation,
  and addressed many defects.

* Since the merge with Distribute, Jason R. Coombs is the
  maintainer of setuptools.  The project is maintained in coordination with
  the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) and the larger Python community.

the problem
===========

What directory should your app use for storing user data? If running on Mac OS X, you
should use::

    ~/Library/Application Support/<AppName>

If on Windows (at least English Win XP) that should be::

    C:\Documents and Settings\<User>\Application Data\Local Settings\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>

or possibly::

    C:\Documents and Settings\<User>\Application Data\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>

for `roaming profiles <http://bit.ly/9yl3b6>`_ but that is another story.

On Linux (and other Unices) the dir, according to the `XDG
spec <http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>`_, is::

    ~/.local/share/<AppName>


``appdirs`` to the rescue
=========================

This kind of thing is what the ``appdirs`` module is for. ``appdirs`` will
help you choose an appropriate:

- user data dir (``user_data_dir``)
- user config dir (``user_config_dir``)
- user cache dir (``user_cache_dir``)
- site data dir (``site_data_dir``)
- site config dir (``site_config_dir``)
- user log dir (``user_log_dir``)

and also:

- is a single module so other Python packages can include their own private copy
- is slightly opinionated on the directory names used. Look for "OPINION" in
  documentation and code for when an opinion is being applied.


some example output
===================

On Mac OS X::

    >>> from appdirs import *
    >>> appname = "SuperApp"
    >>> appauthor = "Acme"
    >>> user_data_dir(appname, appauthor)
    '/Users/trentm/Library/Application Support/SuperApp'
    >>> site_data_dir(appname, appauthor)
    '/Library/Application Support/SuperApp'
    >>> user_cache_dir(appname, appauthor)
    '/Users/trentm/Library/Caches/SuperApp'
    >>> user_log_dir(appname, appauthor)
    '/Users/trentm/Library/Logs/SuperApp'

On Windows 7::

    >>> from appdirs import *
    >>> appname = "SuperApp"
    >>> appauthor = "Acme"
    >>> user_data_dir(appname, appauthor)
    'C:\\Users\\trentm\\AppData\\Local\\Acme\\SuperApp'
    >>> user_data_dir(appname, appauthor, roaming=True)
    'C:\\Users\\trentm\\AppData\\Roaming\\Acme\\SuperApp'
    >>> user_cache_dir(appname, appauthor)
    'C:\\Users\\trentm\\AppData\\Local\\Acme\\SuperApp\\Cache'
    >>> user_log_dir(appname, appauthor)
    'C:\\Users\\trentm\\AppData\\Local\\Acme\\SuperApp\\Logs'

On Linux::

    >>> from appdirs import *
    >>> appname = "SuperApp"
    >>> appauthor = "Acme"
    >>> user_data_dir(appname, appauthor)
    '/home/trentm/.local/share/SuperApp
    >>> site_data_dir(appname, appauthor)
    '/usr/local/share/SuperApp'
    >>> site_data_dir(appname, appauthor, multipath=True)
    '/usr/local/share/SuperApp:/usr/share/SuperApp'
    >>> user_cache_dir(appname, appauthor)
    '/home/trentm/.cache/SuperApp'
    >>> user_log_dir(appname, appauthor)
    '/home/trentm/.cache/SuperApp/log'
    >>> user_config_dir(appname)
    '/home/trentm/.config/SuperApp'
    >>> site_config_dir(appname)
    '/etc/xdg/SuperApp'
    >>> os.environ['XDG_CONFIG_DIRS'] = '/etc:/usr/local/etc'
    >>> site_config_dir(appname, multipath=True)
    '/etc/SuperApp:/usr/local/etc/SuperApp'


``AppDirs`` for convenience
===========================

::

    >>> from appdirs import AppDirs
    >>> dirs = AppDirs("SuperApp", "Acme")
    >>> dirs.user_data_dir
    '/Users/trentm/Library/Application Support/SuperApp'
    >>> dirs.site_data_dir
    '/Library/Application Support/SuperApp'
    >>> dirs.user_cache_dir
    '/Users/trentm/Library/Caches/SuperApp'
    >>> dirs.user_log_dir
    '/Users/trentm/Library/Logs/SuperApp'



Per-version isolation
=====================

If you have multiple versions of your app in use that you want to be
able to run side-by-side, then you may want version-isolation for these
dirs::

    >>> from appdirs import AppDirs
    >>> dirs = AppDirs("SuperApp", "Acme", version="1.0")
    >>> dirs.user_data_dir
    '/Users/trentm/Library/Application Support/SuperApp/1.0'
    >>> dirs.site_data_dir
    '/Library/Application Support/SuperApp/1.0'
    >>> dirs.user_cache_dir
    '/Users/trentm/Library/Caches/SuperApp/1.0'
    >>> dirs.user_log_dir
    '/Users/trentm/Library/Logs/SuperApp/1.0'

  everybody
- [Unix] Removes gratuitous case mangling of the case, since \*nix-es are
  usually case sensitive, so mangling is not wise
- [Unix] Fixes the utterly wrong behaviour in ``site_data_dir``, return result
  based on XDG_DATA_DIRS and make room for respecting the standard which
  specifies XDG_DATA_DIRS is a multiple-value variable
- [Issue 6] Add ``*_config_dir`` which are distinct on nix-es, according to
  XDG specs; on Windows and Mac return the corresponding ``*_data_dir``

appdirs 1.2.0
-------------

- [Unix] Put ``user_log_dir`` under the *cache* dir on Unix. Seems to be more
  typical.
- [issue 9] Make ``unicode`` work on py3k.

appdirs 1.1.0
-------------

- [issue 4] Add ``AppDirs.user_log_dir``.
- [Unix, issue 2, issue 7] appdirs now conforms to `XDG base directory spec
  <http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>`_.
- [Mac, issue 5] Fix ``site_data_dir()`` on Mac.
- [Mac] Drop use of 'Carbon' module in favour of hardcoded paths; supports
  Python3 now.
- [Windows] Append "Cache" to ``user_cache_dir`` on Windows by default. Use
  ``opinion=False`` option to disable this.
- Add ``appdirs.AppDirs`` convenience class. Usage:

        >>> dirs = AppDirs("SuperApp", "Acme", version="1.0")
        >>> dirs.user_data_dir
        '/Users/trentm/Library/Application Support/SuperApp/1.0'

- [Windows] Cherry-pick Komodo's change to downgrade paths to the Windows short
  paths if there are high bit chars.
- [Linux] Change default ``user_cache_dir()`` on Linux to be singular, e.g.
  "~/.superapp/cache".
- [Windows] Add ``roaming`` option to ``user_data_dir()`` (for use on Windows only)
  and change the default ``user_data_dir`` behaviour to use a *non*-roaming
  profile dir (``CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA`` instead of ``CSIDL_APPDATA``). Why? Because
  a large roaming profile can cause login speed issues. The "only syncs on
  logout" behaviour can cause surprises in appdata info.


appdirs 1.0.1 (never released)
------------------------------

Started this changelog 27 July 2010. Before that this module originated in the
`Komodo <http://www.activestate.com/komodo>`_ product as ``applib.py`` and then
as `applib/location.py
<http://github.com/ActiveState/applib/blob/master/applib/location.py>`_ (used by
`PyPM <http://code.activestate.com/pypm/>`_ in `ActivePython
<http://www.activestate.com/activepython>`_). This is basically a fork of
applib.py 1.0.1 and applib/location.py 1.0.1.

Requests is an Apache2 Licensed HTTP library, written in Python, for human
beings.

Most existing Python modules for sending HTTP requests are extremely
verbose and cumbersome. Python's builtin urllib2 module provides most of
the HTTP capabilities you should need, but the api is thoroughly broken.
It requires an enormous amount of work (even method overrides) to
perform the simplest of tasks.

Things shouldn't be this way. Not in Python.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com', auth=('user', 'pass'))
    >>> r.status_code
    204
    >>> r.headers['content-type']
    'application/json'
    >>> r.text
    ...

See `the same code, without Requests <https://gist.github.com/973705>`_.

Requests allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests. You can add headers, form data,
multipart files, and parameters with simple Python dictionaries, and access the
response data in the same way. It's powered by httplib and `urllib3
<https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_, but it does all the hard work and crazy
hacks for you.

2.0.0 (2013-09-24)
++++++++++++++++++

**API Changes:**

- Keys in the Headers dictionary are now native strings on all Python versions,
  i.e. bytestrings on Python 2, unicode on Python 3.
- Proxy URLs now *must* have an explicit scheme. A ``MissingSchema`` exception
  will be raised if they don't.
- Timeouts now apply to read time if ``Stream=False``.
- ``RequestException`` is now a subclass of ``IOError``, not ``RuntimeError``.
- Added new method to ``PreparedRequest`` objects: ``PreparedRequest.copy()``.
- Added new method to ``Session`` objects: ``Session.update_request()``. This
  method updates a ``Request`` object with the data (e.g. cookies) stored on
  the ``Session``.
- Added new method to ``Session`` objects: ``Session.prepare_request()``. This
  method updates and prepares a ``Request`` object, and returns the
  corresponding ``PreparedRequest`` object.
- Added new method to ``HTTPAdapter`` objects: ``HTTPAdapter.proxy_headers()``.
  This should not be called directly, but improves the subclass interface.
- ``httplib.IncompleteRead`` exceptions caused by incorrect chunked encoding
  will now raise a Requests ``ChunkedEncodingError`` instead.
- Invalid percent-escape sequences now cause a Requests ``InvalidURL``
  exception to be raised.

- Major proxy work thanks to @Lukasa including parsing of proxy authentication
  from the proxy url

The famous Iris database, first used by Sir R.A Fisher

This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the
pattern recognition literature.  Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and
is referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The
data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a
type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the
latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

 Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits Data Set

Notes
-----
Data Set Characteristics:
    :Number of Instances: 5620
    :Number of Attributes: 64
    :Attribute Information: 8x8 image of integer pixels in the range 0..16.
    :Missing Attribute Values: None
    :Creator: E. Alpaydin (alpaydin '@' boun.edu.tr)
    :Date: July; 1998

This is a copy of the test set of the UCI ML hand-written digits datasets
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits

The data set contains images of hand-written digits: 10 classes where
each class refers to a digit.

Preprocessing programs made available by NIST were used to extract
normalized bitmaps of handwritten digits from a preprinted form. From a
total of 43 people, 30 contributed to the training set and different 13
to the test set. 32x32 bitmaps are divided into nonoverlapping blocks of
4x4 and the number of on pixels are counted in each block. This generates
an input matrix of 8x8 where each element is an integer in the range
0..16. This reduces dimensionality and gives invariance to small
distortions.
