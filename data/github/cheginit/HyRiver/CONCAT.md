# Summary

Over the last decade, increasing availability of web services for hydrology and
climatology data has facilitated publication of reproducible scientific research in hydrological
and climate studies. Such web services allow researchers to subset big databases and perform some
common data processing operations on the server-side. However, implementing such services increases
the technical complexity of code development as it requires sufficient understanding of their
underlying protocols to generate valid queries and filters. `HyRiver` bridges this gap
by providing a unified and simple Application Programming Interface (API) to web services that are
based on three of the most commonly used protocols for geo-spatial/temporal data publication:
REpresentational State Transfer (RESTful), Web Feature Services (WFS), and Web Map Services (WMS).
`HyRiver` is a software stack consisting of the following seven Python packages:

* [PyGeoHydro](https://github.com/cheginit/pygeohydro): Provides access to NWIS (National Water
  Information System), NID (National Inventory of Dams), HCDN-2009 (Hydro-Climatic Data Network),
  NLCD (National Land Cover Database), and SSEBop (operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance)
  databases. Moreover, it can generate an interactive map for exploring NWIS stations within a
  bounding box, compute categorical statistics of land use/land cover data, and plot five
  hydrologic signature graphs. There is also a helper function which returns a roughness
  coefficients lookup table for NLCD's land cover types. These coefficients can be
  useful for overland flow routing among other applications.
* [PyNHD](https://github.com/cheginit/pynhd): Provides the ability to navigate and subset
  National Hydrography Database [@Buto_2020], at medium- and high-resolution, using NLDI (Hydro
  Network-Linked Data Index), WaterData, and TNM (The National Map) web services. Additionally,
  it can retrieve over 30 catchment-scale attributes from
  [ScienceBase](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5669a79ee4b08895842a1d47)
  and [NHDPlus Value Added Attributes](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/6092c8a62fac45be97a09bfd0b0bf726)
  that are linked to the NHDPlus database via Common Identifiers (ComIDs). `PyNHD` has some
  additional river network tools that use NHDPlus data for routing through a river network.
  This flow routing module is general and accepts any user-defined transport equation for
  computing flow accumulation through a given river network. It sorts the river network
  topologically from upstream to downstream, then accumulates a given attribute based on the
  user-defined transport equation.
* [Py3DEP](https://github.com/cheginit/py3dep): Gives access to topographic data through the
  3D Elevation Program (3DEP) service [@Thatcher_2020]. This package can pull 12 types of
  topographic data from the 3DEP service, such as Digital Elevation Model, slope, aspect, and
  hillshade.
* [PyDaymet](https://github.com/cheginit/pydaymet): Retrieves daily climate data as well as
  their monthly and annual summaries from the Daymet dataset [@Thornton_2020]. It is possible to
  request data for a single location as well as a grid (any valid geometrical shape) at 1-km
  spatial resolution.
* [PyGeoOGC](https://github.com/cheginit/pygeoogc): Generates valid queries for retrieving data
  from supported RESTful-, WMS-, and WFS-based services. Although these web services limit
  the number of features in a single query, under-the-hood, `PyGeoOGC` takes care of breaking down
  a large query into smaller queries according to specifications of the services. Additionally,
  this package offers several notable utilities, such as data re-projection and asynchronous data
  retrieval for speeding up sending/receiving queries.
* [PyGeoUtils](https://github.com/cheginit/pygeoutils): Converts responses from PyGeoOGC's
  supported web services to geo-dataframes (vector data type) or datasets (raster data type).
  Moreover, for gridded data, it can mask the output dataset based on any given geometry.
* [AsyncRetriever](https://github.com/cheginit/async_retriever): `AsyncRetriever` has only one
  purpose; asynchronously sending requests and retrieving responses as `text`, `binary`,
  or `json` objects. It uses persistent caching to speedup the retrieval even further.

These packages are standalone and users can install and work with them independently.
Furthermore, `PyGeoOGC`, `PyGeoUtils`, and `AsyncRetriever` are low-level engines of this software
stack that the other four packages utilize for providing access to some of the most popular
databases in the hydrology community. These two low-level packages are generic and developers can
use them for connecting and sending queries to any other web services that are based on the
protocols that `HyRiver` supports. Currently, `HyRiver` only supports hydrology and climatology
datasets within the US.

# Statement of need

Preparing input data for conducting studies, is often one of the most time-consuming steps. The
difficulties of processing such input data stem from the diverse data sources and types as well as
sizes. For example, hydrological modeling of watersheds might require climate data such as
precipitation and temperature, topology data such as Digital Elevation Model, and a river network.
Climate and topology data are available in raster format, and river network could be from a vector
data type. Additionally, these datasets often have large sizes and subsetting operations can be
computationally demanding. Geospatial web services can carry out subsetting and some common
geographic information system (GIS) operations on server-side. However, these services usually have
different specifications, thus implementing them can be technically challanging. Moreover,
since the underlying protocols of these web services are under active development by organizations
such as [Open Geospatial Consortium](https://www.ogc.org), keeping track of the latest developments
adds another level of complexity. `HyRiver` removes these barriers by providing
consistent and simple, yet configurable, interfaces to these web services. Since these
interfaces are web protocol-specific, not web service-specific, researchers can utilize `HyRiver`
to access a plethora of databases that are offered through RESTFul-, WFS-, and WMS-based services.

There are several open-source packages that offer similar functionalities. For example,
[hydrofunctions](https://github.com/mroberge/hydrofunctions) is a Python package that retrieves
streamflow data from NWIS and [ulmo](https://github.com/ulmo-dev/ulmo) is another Python package
that provides access to several public hydrology and climatology data.
[Sentinelhub-py](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/sentinelhub-py) can download and process
satellite images from six data sources through Python. `Dataretrieval` gives access to some of
the USGS (United States Geological Survey) databases and has two versions in
[R](https://github.com/USGS-R/dataRetrieval) and [Python](https://github.com/USGS-python/dataretrieval).
Another R Package called [HydroData](https://github.com/mikejohnson51/HydroData), provides access
to 15 earth system datasets. Although there are overlaps between `HyRiver` and these packages,
to the best of our knowledge, none of them offer access to the diverse data sources and types
that this software stack provides.
