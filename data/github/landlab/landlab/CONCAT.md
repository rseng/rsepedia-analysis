# Agent-based modeling with Landlab and Mesa

The tutorials in this collection illustrate how to combine Landlab components
and capabilities with the agent-based modeling (ABM) package Mesa to create
integrated simulations that combine ABMs and grid-based continuum-type models.
The examples are deliberately simple, and are designed to show how integrated
models can be built rather than to demonstrate any particular application.

# Summary

Coarse sediment (sand, gravel, and cobbles) moves downstream through river networks. The transport rate of any particular sediment grain on the river bed surface is a function of both the hydraulics of that reach of river and the size distribution of the other grains in the reach. As sediment moves through a river system, grains may be deposited or eroded, burying and exposing other grains, and in the process changing the elevation and slope of each segment of river. This process of river channel evolution through the process of sediment transport is referred to as morphodynamics [@ParkerEbook]. Computational morphodynamic models allow for the prediction of sediment pulse transport, such as that which occurs after dam removal [@Cuietal2006a; @Cuietal2006b; @Cui2007a] or landsliding events [@An2017; @Benda&Dunne1997], as well as the prediction of changes in river channel bed surface grain size [@Fergusonetal2015].

Most computational morphodynamic models take an Eulerian approach, which tracks changes in bed elevation through time as a function of the spatial gradient in sediment flux [e.g., @ParkerEbook]. These models directly compute bed elevation change and sediment flux throughout the domain. One of the major drawbacks with Eulerian morphodynamic models is the difficulty in being able to 'tag' individual sediment particles to answer questions about how an individual sediment particle/input may move, when it might arrive, and what affect it will have on river morphology when it arrives downstream. To overcome this drawback and to more easily extend morphodynamic models to entire river networks, recent work has focused on developing river-network based Lagrangian sediment transport models, which track the locations of individual sediment units on a river network.  

A more comprehensive overview of river-network based sediment transport models is described by @Czubaetal2017. Of most relevance to the work described herein, @Czuba2018 introduced a network-based, Lagrangian bed material morphodynamic model that tracks the motion of individual units (referred to as “parcels”) of sediment through a river network. The model presented by @Czuba2018 has been applied to post-wildfire debris-flow sediment movement through a river network in Utah [@Murphyetal2019]. Czuba's approach improves on the existing morphodynamic models by: (1) accounting for the full river network, rather than a single longitudinal profile, (2) allowing the user to ‘tag’ particular sediment inputs and track their fate through time. Despite its advances, this existing network sediment transport model, however, has two notable drawbacks: 1) it written in a proprietary scripting language (MATLAB), and 2) it is not explicitly designed to be interoperable with other Earth-surface models, such as streamflow or landslide models.

Here, we present software that overcomes these two drawbacks, translating and expanding upon the network sediment transport model of @Czuba2018 in Landlab, a modular, Python-based package for the modeling of Earth-surface dynamics. Landlab is an open-source Python package for modeling Earth-surface processes [@Hobley2017Creative; @Barnhart2020Short]. It was designed as a modular framework, hosting a variety of process components such as flow routing, hillslope diffusion, and stream power erosion that function on a common set of landscape model grids. The ``NetworkSedimentTransporter`` is the newest of these components. We first describe computational infrastructure built in order to create the ``NetworkSedimentTransporter`` and then describe the new component itself.

The creation of the ``NetworkSedimentTransporter`` required the addition of two new data structures in the Landlab framework. First, the ``NetworkModelGrid``, which represents the model domain as connected nodes and links. Second, the ``DataRecord``, which stores a generic set of items in time and on the model grid. It is used here to store all attributes associated with the sediment parcels that move into, through, and out of the model domain.

In the ``NetworkSedimentTransporter``, sediment is represented as "parcels"-a quantity of sediment grains with common attributes such as grain diameter, lithology, and density. Each parcel is transported, buried, and eroded as a coherent unit. The river network is represented as a series of links and nodes on a ``NetworkModelGrid``. Each time the ``NetworkSedimentTransporter`` is run forward in time, the set of parcels that are in active transport is identified based on the flow conditions and bed surface grain size in each link, transport distances are calculated for all active parcels based on the @WilcockCrowe2003 equations, and parcels move through links on the network by updating their locations based on their transport distances [@Czuba2018]. As a result of parcel redistribution, the elevation of nodes and slope of the links evolves [@Czubaetal2017; @Czuba2018].

Our implementation is not a direct translation of the model implemented in MATLAB and described in @Czuba2018. Here we add three new elements to the model: sediment density that varies across parcels, downstream bed-material abrasion, and enhanced capabilities for specifying the active layer thickness.

The use of the ``DataRecord`` attributes to store density and the abrasion-rate coefficient permits different values for each sediment parcel. The density influences which parcels are mobile and how far they move each timestep. Variable (rather than constant) density permits better representing study sites with lithologic variation. Similarly, different rock types may abrade at different rates. The abrasion-rate is calculated as the loss of particle mass (or volume, because density is constant within each parcel) during transport downstream as:

$W_x = W_0 \exp \left(\alpha x \right)$

Where $x$ is the downstream transport distance, $\alpha$ is the abrasion rate (for mass loss), and $W_x$ and $W_0$ are the resulting and original sediment parcel masses, respectively. The model tracks parcel volumes (not masses) so the actual implementation replaces $W_x$ and $W_0$ with volumes (e.g., $W_0=V_0\rho_s$, where $V_0$ is the original sediment parcel volume and $\rho_s$ is the rock density of the sediment in the parcel); however, the form of the equation for mass or volume is equivalent for a parcel with a constant sediment density (i.e., the $\rho_s$ on both sides of the equation cancel out). Furthermore, once a volume reduction of each parcel is computed, the model also updates the associated reduction in parcel sediment grain size as:

$D_x = D_0 \left(\frac{V_x}{V_0}\right)^{1/3}$

Where $D_x$ and $D_0$ are the resulting and original sediment parcel diameters, respectively.

Our final modification to @Czuba2018 is enhancing the methods used for calculating variable active layer thickness. Many sediment transport models [e.g., @Cui2007b; @Czuba2018] represent the mobile portion of the grains on the riverbed at any given time as an "active layer" of constant thickness. All grains in this layer are transported, whereas all grains below this layer are immobile. Within ``NetworkSedimentTransporter`` the user has the option to specify active layer thickness as a constant value or a multiple of the mean grain size in each link. Alternatively, we incorporated the formulation of @Wongetal2007 to calculate an active layer thickness for each link in the network at each timestep as a function of Shields stress and median grain diameter.

The ``NetworkSedimentTransporter`` component of Landlab is capable of routing mixed grain size sediment through river networks to answer questions about how sediment pulses move through river networks and when, where, and how they affect downstream reaches. The accessibility of this code within the Landlab framework will make it easier for future users to modify and contribute to its continual evolution.

Source code for ``NetworkSedimentTransporter`` is available as part of the [Landlab Python package](https://github.com/landlab/landlab) and can be found in
the [``NetworkSedimentTransporter`` component](https://github.com/landlab/landlab/tree/release/landlab/components/network_sediment_transporter). The first release version of Landlab that includes the ``NetworkSedimentTransporter`` component is tagged as v2.1.0.

source code, a set of Jupyter Notebooks introducing the use of NetworkSedimentTransporter

# Summary

The surface of the Earth reflects the competing advection of rock by tectonic
processes and the erosion of rock by wind, water, and ice. Rock properties
influence erosion rates by changing the processes responsible for erosion and
the rate at which rock is weathered, detached, and turned into mobile sediment.
Variations in the rock properties over space and with depth reflect the legacy
of sedimentary deposition and tectonic deformation. Long-term landscape
evolution modeling experiments that include the impact of spatially and
temporally variable rock characteristics can be used to identify the impact of
rock strength patterns on other geologic observables such as topography, erosion
rates, and detrital mineral records [e.g., @Forte2016Complexites;
@Perne2017Steady]. Identifying these relationships allows for better
interpretations of the geologic record.

Landlab is an Open Source Python package that provides a framework for the
development of 2D numerical models, typically in Earth surface dynamics
[@Hobley2017Creative]. Landlab was designed as a  modular framework in which
different process components can be mixed and matched to construct a model based
on a user's needs. Prior work on spatially variable lithology in landscape
evolution has been done using a modified version of the channel-hillslope
integrated landscape development [CHILD, @tucker2001channel] model [e.g.,
@Forte2016Complexites] and the FastScape V5 model [@braun2013very;
@Perne2017Steady]. To provide these capabilities within the Landlab framework,
there is a need for a Landlab submodule that can treat spatial variations in
rock materials.  

This contribution describes ``Lithology``, a Landlab submodule designed to
support the representation of 3D variations in rock material properties within
the Landlab framework. It includes two classes: ``Lithology`` is a generic
representation of spatially varying rock material, and ``LithoLayers`` is a
derived class that treats parallel layers of material variations. In both
classes, each rock type may have multiple attributes. Rock layers may be removed
through erosion, or added to through deposition. Two options for the underlying
datastructure are supported: "event layers", in which the data structure stores
each time-step as an event even if there is no material in the layer, or
"material layers", in which entries in the datastructure represent contiguous
material of the same property, but not necessarily the same age. This second
option is more memory efficient but does not record the transient dynamics of
erosion and deposition.

Source code for ``Lithology`` and ``Litholayers`` is available as part of the
[Landlab python package](https://github.com/landlab/landlab) and can be found in
the [``Lithology``
submodule](https://github.com/landlab/landlab/tree/release/landlab/components/lithology).
The ``Lithology`` submodule is documented using Docstrings, and the
documentation can be found on the Landlab ReadTheDocs site. One page exists for
the [Lithology
component](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/release/landlab.components.lithology.html)
and a second for the [LithoLayers
component](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/release/landlab.components.litholayers.html).
Unit and docstring tests provide 100% coverage of this submodule. [Pull Request #
674](https://github.com/landlab/landlab/pull/674) brought the ``Lithology``
submodule into the core Landlab source code. The first release version of
Landlab that includes the ``Lithology`` submodule is tagged as v1.5.4. The
concept DOI for Landlab is archived in Zenodo with the linked DOI: [@ZenodoLithologySourceCode]
and the archive for this manuscript points to the Zenodo archive of v1.5.4.

The Landlab project maintains a separate repository containing tutorials that
introduce core concepts and the use of individual submodules. In addition to the
source code, a [Jupyter Notebook introducing the use of Lithology and
Litholayers](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/landlab/tutorials/blob/release/lithology/lithology_and_litholayers.ipynb)
is now part of the Landlab tutorials repository. This tutorial was brought into
the repository with [Pull Request #
19](https://github.com/landlab/tutorials/pull/19). The first release version of
the Landlab tutorials that includes this notebooks is tagged as v1.5.4 and is
archived in Zenodo with the linked DOI: [@ZenodoLithologyNotebook].

# Summary
A large portion of the water that enters a catchment as precipitation percolates through soil and rock before exiting to water bodies or returning to the atmosphere as evapotranspiration. In many places, the discharge of water stored in the subsurface is a primary source of streamflow, and thus controls the ways in which catchments respond to stochastic variations in precipitation and climate [@beck_global_2013; @jasechko_pronounced_2014]. Previous studies have shown the importance of groundwater for a diverse range of processes, from transpiration to solute export [@maxwell_connections_2016; @van_verseveld_role_2009], and across diverse timescales, from rainfall-runoff response to landscape evolution [@huang_modelling_2006; @sklash_role_1979]. Of particular relevance to landscape evolution, groundwater can be an important control on the occurrence of overland flow, as the interaction of the water table with the ground surface controls the spatial extent of saturation and groundwater return flow [@dunne_partial_1970].
Variably-saturated groundwater flow is often assumed to be governed by the Richards equation, which describes how water content and/or total energy potential evolve in an idealized porous medium due to fluxes of water driven by gradients in total potential. Numerical solutions to the Richards equation are computationally expensive [e.g. @kirkland_algorithms_1992], often limiting their applications. For computational efficiency, we use the widely applied Dupuit-Forcheimer approximation, which simplifies the Richards equation when aquifers are laterally extensive in comparison to their thickness, and the capillary fringe above the water table is relatively thin [e.g. @childs_drainage_1971; @troch_hillslope-storage_2003]. In this case, the water table is modeled as a free surface with groundwater flow driven by gradients in water table elevation. This formulation is known as the Boussinesq model of an unconfined aquifer. When the model assumptions are valid, this greatly reduces the model complexity while still producing water table elevations and discharges comparable to Richards equation solutions [@hilberts_hillslope-storage_2004].

Groundwater models of varying complexity are available for different purposes. Fully coupled groundwater and surface water models such as PARFLOW [@kollet_integrated_2006], CATHY [@camporese_surface-subsurface_2010], and PIHM [@qu_semidiscrete_2007] solve the three-dimensional Richards equation for variably saturated flow, and couple this with precipitation and runoff components. MODFLOW [@langevin_modflow_2019] also solves the three dimensional Richards equation, and may be coupled to precipitation and runoff models, as in GSFLOW [@regan_gsflow_2018]. More parsimonious models (with fewer necessary parameters and calculations) are also available, such as those that solve the hillslope storage Boussinesq equation for one-dimensional groundwater flow in hillslopes of non-constant width [@marcais_dynamic_2017, @broda_low-dimensional_2012]. Two-dimensional implementations of the Boussinesq model are common, but do not appear to be widely available as open source packages. The simplicity and computational efficiency of this method is advantageous for capturing the first-order effects of groundwater flow on other Earth surface processes. More sophisticated groundwater models may be necessary depending on the hydrological features that the user intends to capture.

Implementations of the Boussinesq model often encounter numerical instabilities where the water table intersects the surface and groundwater return flow occurs through a seepage face. This is due to the presence of a discontinuity in the energy gradient from inside the hillslope (where it is determined by the water table) to the seepage face (where it is determined by the topography). @marcais_dynamic_2017 introduced a regularization that smooths the transition between subsurface flow and surface flow. Although introduced for numerical stability and not based on physical principles, this smoothing may reproduce the effect of subgrid heterogeneity where saturation within a grid cell is unlikely to be homogenous or well-reproduced by a binary condition (saturated vs unsaturated).

The ``GroundwaterDupuitPercolator`` solves the governing groundwater flow equations with an explicit, forward in time finite volume method, using the @marcais_dynamic_2017 regularization at seepage faces. While the explicit method limits the maximum timestep that can be used without jeopardizing stability, the model includes an adaptive timestep solver that subdivides the user-provided timestep in order to satisfy a Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy stability criterion.

The ``GroundwaterDupuitPercolator`` can be implemented on both regular (e.g. rectangular and hexagonal) and irregular grids determined by the user. Recharge, hydraulic conductivity, and porosity may be specified as single values uniform over the model domain, or as vectors on the nodes (recharge, porosity) or links (hydraulic conductivity) of the grid. Link hydraulic conductivity can also be specified from a two-dimensional hydraulic conductivity tensor using an included function. For mass balance calculations, the model includes methods to determine the total groundwater storage on the grid domain, the total recharge flux in, and total groundwater and surface water fluxes leaving through the boundaries.

The ``GroundwaterDupuitPercolator`` is implemented in Landlab, a Python-based open source Earth surface modeling toolkit [@hobley_creative_2017]. Landlab has a modular framework, which allows for easy coupling of different process components to meet the needs of the modeler. For example, the surface water flux from the ``GroundwaterDupuitPercolator`` can be passed to the ``FlowAccumulator`` module to route overland flow and calculate discharge at nodes. A summary of links to the documentation and example Jupyter notebooks is provided by the submodule [README](https://github.com/landlab/landlab/tree/master/landlab/components/groundwater). A diverse array of components are available, yielding many possibilities for model coupling that have not yet been explored. Given the importance of groundwater for many Earth surface processes, this component is an important contribution to the Landlab environment.

# Introduction and Statement of Need

The surface of the Earth and its biota evolve together. Climate and tectonics ultimately drive the physical and chemical surface processes that evolve landscape structure, including the connectivity of landscape portions that facilitate or impede movement of organismal populations [@Stanley:1979; @Antonelli:2018]. Impeded organismal movement reduces gene flow among populations and genetic diversity within populations, increasing the probability of species extinction [@Bohonak:1999]. Long-term geographic separation of populations (i.e., allopatry) is a mechanism of speciation as populations genetically diverge due to reproductive isolation [@Coyne:1992]. Speciation within the same area (i.e., sympatry) can emerge as subpopulations specialize in different resources, and along environmental gradients (e.g., in surface air temperature) where a continuum of reproductive isolation develops, among other proposed mechanisms [@Dieckmann:1999; @Doebeli:2003]. These macroevolutionary processes—dispersal, extinction, and speciation—determine regional biodiversity [@Taylor:1993].

Biodiversity is influenced by changes in landscape connectivity, nevertheless linking the evolution of a landscape with its biota is complicated by limited landform and genetic preservation, disparate timescales of surface and macroevolutionary processes, and landscape heterogeneity (e.g., species-dense assemblages, lithological variability), among numerous other factors. Discovery of surface dynamics has been aided by numerical landscape evolution models [@Tucker:2010]. These models act as digital laboratories where researchers can apply current theory to simulate complex surface dynamics while quantitatively exploring new ideas. Yet to be developed and widely shared is a modeling tool that integrates macroevolutionary processes with numerical representations of surface processes. Such a tool can help research communities overcome the complications of linking the evolution of life and landscapes.

We built ``SpeciesEvolver`` to simulate biotic evolution at geologic and macroevolutionary timescales. This software is adapted from SEAMLESS (Spatially Explicit Area Model of Landscape Evolution by SimulationS) that models organismal diversification in one-dimensional space [@Albert:2016]. ``SpeciesEvolver`` operates in two-dimensional landscapes, is built for extension, and is a component of the ``Landlab`` modeling toolkit.

``Landlab`` is an open source Python package that provides tools to build numerical models of surface dynamics [@Hobley:2017]. A landscape is represented by a model grid with configurable spatial dimensions. The surface processes components of ``Landlab`` drive change in landscape attributes (e.g., topographic elevation). The use of multiple components in a model effectively couples the processes because the processes work with the same grid and its landscape attributes. Building ``SpeciesEvolver`` into ``Landlab`` allows its users to build landscape-life evolution models to examine biological evolution alongside surface processes-driven landscape evolution.

# Software Extensibility

``SpeciesEvolver`` is adaptable to various modeling approaches and taxa, defined as a group of organisms (e.g., a population, species, or broader taxonomic level). The simulated taxa are implemented as classes with methods for macroevolutionary processes. The base class, ``Taxon`` provides abstract methods and properties that can be expanded or overridden. Software users can readily subclass ``Taxon`` designed for their model, including specialty properties (e.g., body size), behaviors (e.g., dispersal as a function of least cost paths), and taxon composition (e.g., composed of individual organisms).

The built-in implementation of taxon, ``ZoneTaxon`` evaluates macroevolutionary processes using a concept of landscape connectivity analyzed with ``Zone`` objects that manage the location of taxa in the model grid. The software user creates a function that returns the total extent of zones in the grid. Individual zones are automatically identified as the adjacent grid nodes within the total zone extent. In the example in Fig. 1a, zones are created where a grid variable—a variable selected by the user—is greater than 1. Two zones are created in this example because the nodes that meet this condition cluster in two discrete areas.

Landscape connectivity of ``ZoneTaxon`` is determined by the spatiotemporal relationships of zones. At a model time step, the relationship is determined for each zone. This relationship describes the spatial intersection of zones as ‘x-to-y’ where ‘x’ and ‘y’ are the descriptive counts of zones belonging to the intersection in the prior and current time steps, respectively. Zone connectivity relationships are illustrated in Fig. 1b. The relationships and their impact on ``ZoneTaxon`` objects are

* one-to-one: This relationship occurs where a zone in the prior time step either (a) precisely overlaps one zone in the current time step, (b) partially overlaps one zone in the current step, or (c) intersects one zone in the current step with a different shape and/or size. This relationship triggers only dispersal of the ``ZoneTaxon`` to the zone location updated in the current time step.
* one-to-many: A zone in the prior time step is overlapped by multiple zones in the current time step. The taxa in the prior step zone disperse across the multiple zones in the current step. Speciation is triggered following a duration set by the ``allopatric_wait_time`` parameter set for instances of ``ZoneTaxon``, as described in the documentation of this class.
* many-to-one: Multiple zones in the prior time step are overlapped by a zone in the current time step. Taxa extant across the multiple prior step zones exist within the same zone of the current step. By default, taxa in a zone do not affect each other, although predatory and resource-limited dynamics, for example, can be implemented in subclasses of ``ZoneTaxon``.
* many-to-many: Multiple zones in the prior step are overlapped by multiple zones in the current step. Zone counts in both the prior and current steps must be greater than one for the connectivity to be assigned this relationship. Zone counts in these steps do not need to be the same for the connectivity to be assigned this relationship. Taxa extant in prior step zones are relocated to current step zones. Speciation occurs following the ``allopatric_wait_time`` parameter set for the taxon.
* one-to-none: A zone in the prior step overlaps no zones in the current step. Taxa in the zone of the prior step become extinct as of the current time step.

@Lyons:2019 used the built-in taxon type, ``ZoneTaxon`` to investigate how changes in stream network connectivity impacted the diversity of simulated riverine species in this first application of ``SpeciesEvolver``. The species were populated to stream grid nodes and diversification emerged where stream connectivity changed. The flexibility of ``SpeciesEvolver`` with the growing library of surface processes in ``Landlab`` provides ample opportunities to discover links between landscapes and its biota. Links to ``SpeciesEvolver`` documentation and Jupyter Notebook tutorials are provided in the component [README](https://github.com/landlab/landlab/tree/master/landlab/components/species_evolution).

# SpeciesEvolver: evolve life in simulated landscapes

[![status](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/446f3d17d642682b234ffed2b53198f6/status.svg)](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/446f3d17d642682b234ffed2b53198f6)

Life evolves alongside landscapes by biotic and abiotic processes under complex
dynamics at Earth's surface. Researchers who wish to explore these dynamics can
use this component as a tool for them to build landscape-life evolution models.
Landlab components, including SpeciesEvolver are designed to work with a shared
model grid. Researchers can build novel models using plug-and-play surface
process components to evolve the grid's landscape alongside the life tracked by
SpeciesEvolver. The simulated life evolves following customizable processes.

What does Landlab do?
---------------------

Landlab is an open-source Python-language package for numerical modeling of
Earth surface dynamics. It contains

* A gridding engine which represents the model domain. Regular and irregular
  grids are supported.
* A library of process components, each of which represents a physical process
  (e.g., generation of rain, erosion by flowing water). These components have
  a common interface and can be combined based on a user's needs.
* Utilities that support general numerical methods, file input/output, and
  visualization.

In addition Landlab contains a set of Jupyter notebook tutorials providing
an introduction to core concepts and examples of use.

Landlab was designed for disciplines that quantify Earth surface dynamics such
as geomorphology, hydrology, glaciology, and stratigraphy. It can also be used
in related fields. Scientists who use this type of model often build
their own unique model from the ground up, re-coding the basic building blocks
of their landscape model rather than taking advantage of codes that have
already been written. Landlab saves practitioners from the need for this kind
of re-invention by providing standardized components that they can re-use.

Watch the webinar `Landlab Toolkit Overview <https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Presenters-0407>`_
at CSDMS to learn more.

How do I install Landlab?
-------------------------

First you'll need a Python distribution and either the conda or pip package
manager. If you don't know what you want, we recommend the Anaconda Python
distribution.

Two main installation options exist for Landlab. Most people will likely want
to
`install a prepackaged binary <https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/index.html>`_.
We distribute through both conda-forge and pip.

Landlab 2.0
```````````

In April 2020 Landlab switched to version 2.0. Landlab dropped
support of Python 2.7 with this transition.

Supported Python Versions
`````````````````````````

Landlab supports Python versions >= 3.6. Landlab distributes pre-packaged
binaries through `conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/landlab>`_
and `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/landlab/>`_ for versions 3.6 through 3.9.

Conda Environment with Pre-packaged Binary Distribution
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````

To create a conda environment that installs a pre-packaged binary and all the
dependencies necessary to run the notebooks, clone the repository, navigate to
within the top level directory and use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda env create --file=environment.yml

Then activate the environment and open the welcome notebook execute the
following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda activate landlab_notebooks
    $ jupyter notebook notebooks/welcome.ipynb

Developer Installation
``````````````````````

Individuals interested in modifying the Landlab source code should follow the
`developer installation instructions <https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/install/index.html>`_
which describe cloning the source code, creating a conda environment for
development, compiling, and testing the code.

In short, clone the repository, navigate to the top level directory, and
run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda create -n landlab python
    $ conda install -n landlab --file=requirements.txt
    $ conda activate landlab
    $ pip install -e .

This will install *landlab* and it's dependencies. You may want to install
some additional utilities used for developing, testing, and running *landlab*
notebooks. This can be done with the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install --file=requirements-dev.txt
    $ conda install --file=requirements-testing.txt
    $ conda install --file=requirements-notebooks.txt


How do I verify I've installed Landlab correctly?
-------------------------------------------------

Landlab uses pytest to discover and run tests. These include docstring tests
located within the core source code (``landlab/landlab`` directory) and unit
tests located within the ``landlab/tests`` directory. Presuming you have used a
source code installation with the above conda environment, you will be able to
test your install with

.. code-block::

    $ pytest

from within the ``landlab_dev`` conda environment. Additional instructions,
including how the unit tests directory is structured can be found under the
`testing section`_ of the landlab documentation.

.. _testing section: https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/development/install/test.html

What are Landlab's dependencies?
--------------------------------

The core package dependencies are specified by ``requirements.txt`` and used
by ``setup.py``. There are some additional dependencies that exist for
running the notebooks or modifying the source code and testing.

Details of how we structure our dependencies can be found under the
`dependencies section`_ of the landlab documentation.

.. _dependencies section: https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/development/practices/dependencies.html

How do I learn more about Landlab?
----------------------------------

Our documentation is hosted on ReadTheDocs at https://landlab.readthedocs.io/.
This includes a User Guide and API reference.

The following paper describes the design of Landlab.

`Hobley, D. E. J. <https://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/5/21/2017/>`__, Adams,
J. M., Nudurupati, S. S., Hutton, E. W. H., Gasparini, N. M., Istanbulluoglu,
E. and Tucker, G. E., 2017, Creative computing with Landlab: an open-source
toolkit for building, coupling, and exploring two-dimensional numerical models
of Earth-surface dynamics, Earth Surface Dynamics, 5, p 21-46,
10.5194/esurf-5-21-2017.

Are there any examples of using Landlab I can look at?
------------------------------------------------------

The Landlab package contains a directory, ``landlab/notebooks``, with
Jupyter Notebooks describing core concepts and giving examples of using components.
The file ``landlab/notebooks/welcome.ipynb`` provides a table of contents to
the notebooks and is the recommended starting place.
Additionally, there are a set of notebooks curated to teach physical processes
located in the directory ``landlab/notebooks/teaching``.

Run on Binder

==========================================================
Landlab: A modular Earth Surface Dynamics modeling library
==========================================================

Landlab is an open-source Python-language package for numerical modeling of
Earth surface dynamics. It contains:

* A gridding engine which represents the model domain. Regular and irregular
  grids are supported.
* A library of process components, each of which represents a physical process
  (e.g., generation of rain, erosion by flowing water). These components have
  a common interface and can be combined based on a user's needs.
* Utilities that support general numerical methods, file input/output, and
  visualization.

In addition Landlab contains a set of Jupyter notebook tutorials providing
an introduction to core concepts and examples of use.

Landlab was designed for disciplines that quantify Earth surface dynamics such
as geomorphology, hydrology, glaciology, and stratigraphy. It can also be used
in related fields. Scientists who use this type of model often build
their own unique model from the ground up, re-coding the basic building blocks
of their landscape model rather than taking advantage of codes that have
already been written. Landlab saves practitioners from the need for this kind
of re-invention by providing standardized components that they can re-use.

Watch the webinar `Landlab Toolkit Overview <https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Presenters-0407>`_
at CSDMS to learn more.

The most current source code is always available from our `git
repository <https://github.com/landlab/landlab>`_.

If you are interested in the state of current development, we compile
:ref:`ongoing development <ongoing_development>`. If you are interested in
contributing but don't know how to get started (THANK YOU!),
we compile :ref:`desired contributions <desired_contributions>` and have a
:ref:`page all about development <development>`.

Many Jupyter notebooks exist describing use of Landlab. Find an overview
:ref:`here <tutorials>`. A subset of these notebooks are designed specifically
for the classroom. Information about them and how to set them up for classroom
use is described :ref:`on this page <teaching_tutorials>`.

Landlab 2.0
-----------

In late April 2020 Landlab reached version 2.0.
Landlab dropped support of Python 2.7 with this transition.

Supported Python Versions
-------------------------

Landlab supports Python versions >= 3.6. Landlab distributes pre-packaged
binaries through `conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/landlab>`_
and `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/landlab/>`_ for versions 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9.

====================
Guide for Developers
====================

If you're intending to make changes to the Landlab code base, or want to
develop your own components, this set of pages will provide information you
need.

Key Development Recommendations
-------------------------------

The most important things to remember are to:

  * Start by creating a fork of Landlab's repository;
  * Make changes to the source code on a development branch, not the default
    `master` branch; and
  * Keep your fork's `master` and development branches up to date with changes
    in the main Landlab repository.
  * Consider creating a small Pull Request to update the page on
    :ref:`ongoing development <ongoing_development>` so that others know what
    you are working on.

Supported Python Versions
-------------------------
Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8

If you need to introduce a new dependency, that dependency must be compatible
with Python  3.6+.

Installation, Contribution, and Development Practices
-----------------------------------------------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   install/index
   contribution/index
   practices/index
   package_organization

Quick Links For Package Maintenance
-----------------------------------

There are a few pages that are particularly important for the maintenance of
the package. These are:

* :ref:`directory organization <organization>`
* :ref:`testing protocol <testing>`
* :ref:`dependency organization <dependencies>`, and
* :ref:`release workflow <dev_releases>`

If package maintainers change any of these, the prior pages likely need
updating.

=====================================
Develop your own component or utility
=====================================

Landlab grows and improves thanks to user contributions. We encourage you to
develop your own component or utility!

Thank you to all who have contributed to landlab!

In addition to components, Landlab has many utilities useful in creating
components and doing model output post-processing. While this document
primarily discusses creating, documenting, and testing a components, most of
the steps are the same for developing a utility. Unlike a component, a utility
can just be a function. But like a component, we expect contributed utilities
to follow the landlab standard practices outlined in our documentation.

Once you have installed Landlab (:ref:`developer install <developer_install>`)
and :ref:`created your own branch <landlab_develop_with_git>`, you can start
writing a Python script for your component.

See `this tutorial <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=notebooks/tutorials/making_components/making_components.ipynb>`_
for instructions on the structure and content of your component code. See also
`this example pull request <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/pull/678>`_, which
shows you the common set of files (such as ``__init__.py`` and documentation
files) that get added or modified when a component is added to Landlab.

See the :ref:`Standard Naming conventions <component_standard_names>` for good practice
on parameters and variables naming.

The following pages describe the software development practices that Landlab
strives to follow. Our goal is to make the capabilities of Landlab
well-documented to support new users while not enforcing substantial burdens on
community contributors. If you have any questions about the process after you
have finished reading the documentation, consider making an
`Issue <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues/>`_ to ask the
development team for help.


We recommend that you review the Landlab development practices:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   ../practices/index

Files structure
---------------
For your new component, you should create a folder in
``landlab/landlab/components`` caled ``<my_component_name>`` that contains:

- Your Python script `my_component_name.py`
- `_init_.py` which is structured as

  .. code-block:: python

     from .my_component_name import MyComponent
     __all__ = ['MyComponent', ]

  Where

      - `'.my_component_name'` is the name of the python script.
      - `'MyComponent'` is as defined in the _name header of your python script

  See `this tutorial <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=notebooks/tutorials/making_components/making_components.ipynb>`_
  on making a component for additional document requirements.

  In addition there are a number of recommendations and requirements for
  Landlab components :ref:`summarized here <dev_component_rules>`.

- a folder in the ``landlab/tests/components/<my_component_name>`` directory containing
  unit tests. The unit tests are run every time changes are pushed to the
  Landlab repository. They should go through every line of your code (e.g.
  test every possible scenario in if/else loops, exceptions, etc.). See
  `the tutorial on making a component <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=notebooks/tutorials/making_components/making_components.ipynb>`_
  for instructions about making docstring tests and the next section for more
  information about making the unit tests.

- a document in ``docs/source/reference/components`` called ``my_component_name.rst``.
  Look at other documents in that folder to get a sense of the typical format.
  This document is what will put your component's documentation on the
  ReadTheDocs page. See more below.

Once everything is working, you can :ref:`create a pull request <landlab_develop_with_git>`
to have your branch merged into the master so that your component can be
included in the Landlab library and used by others.

This will trigger :ref:`continuous integration testing <dev_ci>` of your branch
(doc tests, unit tests, and lint) to ensure its compatibility on all supported
environments. You can find the results of these tests on the GitHub page of
your pull request. If the tests fail, edit your files and commit your changes
to re-run the tests (you don't need to make another pull request).

Getting your component into the documentation
---------------------------------------------
Landlab uses the third party Sphinx code documentation tool to automatically
build the :ref:`Reference section <api>` that list our user-facing components.
This means your new component won't appear on the webpages unless you also make
some changes to files you'll find in `landlab/docs/source`.

You need to modify `landlab/docs/source/reference/components/index.rst`, and
also create a new file in the folder
`landlab/docs/source/reference/components`, called
`[short_name_for_your_component].rst`.

The best advice for both of these is to follow an existing example.

For the new `.rst` file, use e.g. `diffusion.rst` as a template. The first line
with the path specification needs to be changed to give the same name as the
`.py` file in which your component lives; the rest of the code text stays the
same.

For the update to `index.rst`, just copy what has been done for the others,
where the path specification now points at the new `.rst` file you made, i.e.,
`[short_name_for_your_component]` (leaving off the `.rst`).

Note your component won't appear on the user-facing part of the website until
it's included in a Landlab release.

Your component is accepted to Landlab. What's next?
---------------------------------------------------
Congrats on all your hard work! Once you know your component has been accepted
and is included in a Landlab release, please
`add it to the CSDMS Model Repository <https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Contribute_model>`_.
You can link directly to the source code on Github. Just fill out the questionnaire.

Have you written up some tutorials or Jupyter notebooks to help teach new users
about your component? Consider submitting a tutorial along with your component.

If you've presented a poster or submitted a paper about your Landlab component,
advertise your work on the :ref:`Landlab Papers and Presentations <papers>`
page. Make your request to a member of the Landlab development team via a
GitHub Issue. If you'd like, also attach an abstract or poster PDF.

I'm still confused
------------------
The Landlab development team will be happy to hear from you.
`Create an issue <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues>`_ and we'll try to
resolve your problem.

Workflow to submit your Landlab contribution to Journal of Open Source Software
===============================================================================

The `Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) <https://joss.theoj.org>`_ is a
venue for publications on open source software. If you are considering
preparing a contribution to Landlab for a JOSS publication, please make sure to
review the JOSS `submission requirements
<https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html#submission-requirements>`_


Parts of Landlab have already been published by JOSS, and multiple parts of
Landlab may be under consideration at JOSS at the same time. Under these
circumstances there may be conflicts with the required `paper.md` file.

For this reason, the workflow below has been developed for those who choose to
submit their Landlab contribution (e.g., a Landlab component, utility) to this
journal.


- Create a pull request to merge the contribution into Landlab. See
  :ref:`Develop your own component or utility <landlab_component_dev_page>`.
- Following the above merge, create a new branch for the JOSS review process.
  Name the paper ``paper.md``, which follows JOSS requirements, and place this
  file in a new folder, ``/landlab/joss/<name_of_contribution>/`` with your other
  JOSS submission materials (e.g., bib, figures if any).
- Submit to JOSS. The submitting author must comment on the pre-review issue
  that the paper is on a branch, and they should build the branch with this
  command

  .. code-block:: bash

      $ @whedon prepare pdf from branch my-custom-branch-name

- Once the JOSS review is complete and if the paper is accepted:
- Create a pull request to merge the JOSS review branch into the ``master``
  branch.
- Merge ``master`` into ``release``, and update version number. See
  :ref:`Create a Landlab release <dev_releases>`.
- Ensure that the release is correctly created and distributed.
- Update the JOSS review pull request with the correct archive DOI and
  version number.
- JOSS publishes the paper.
- Once publication is complete, make another pull request to move and rename
  the ``paper.md`` to ``landlab/joss/published/<name_of_module_or_component>/<new_paper_name>.md``.
  The paper can no longer be named ``paper.md`` because JOSS expects paper in
  review to have this name, and to avoid conflicts with other Landlab paper
  contributions in review. Note that the paper folder should be moved to
  within the ``published`` directory.

Publication of Landlab Contributions
------------------------------------

A number of researchers have used the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)
and Geoscientific Model Development as a journal outlet to publish their
contribution to Landlab. There are a few aspects of the submission workflow for
JOSS that are non-standard and are described below.

In addition, the JOSS editorial board and the Landlab core development team are
presently (Jan 2019) working on defining some guidelines regarding what
contributions to Landlab fit the scope of a JOSS submission. These will be
summarized here when finalized. If you have any questions regarding whether
your potential JOSS submission is appropriate, the best thing to do is to
make a pre-submission inquiry with JOSS.
.. _dev_component_rules:

=========================================================
Recommendations and Rules for User-Contributed Components
=========================================================

Reference the component tutorial

Also the best practices tutorial.

First, thank you for considering contributing a component! The following are
some rules and recommendations.

Rules
-----
- ``super`` is called in the init
- All public attributes are properties
- A component uses all required inputs fields and creates all required output fields.
- Components have complete metadata in ``_info``.
- The component's ``__init__`` method takes a Landlab model grid as the first argument.
- The component has a main method that takes either ``dt`` or nothing. The name is descriptive but does not need to be standardized.
    * Solution is that using setters and getters or making a grid scalar.
    * Some common name patterns include `update()`, `run_one_step()`, or `calculate_name_of_thing()`.
- A component raises a ``ValueError`` if unused keyword arguments are provided.
- A component raises a ``ValueError`` if a grid type the component does not support is passed.
- Component fields use consistent definition and dimensions (not necessarily units).

Recommendations
---------------

- A component has a ``run_one_step`` method as its main method.
- Arguments and keyword arguments start with lower case letters.
- Keyword arguments have reasonable default values (and the grid is the only argument to ``__init__``.
- Can return or not return information. Some recommendations, Nothing, grid, or a ... or a calculated value.
- If possible, we recommend that components are unit agnostic. 
.. _style_enforcement:

================================
Style Guidelines and Enforcement
================================

General Coding Style
--------------------

-  Please stick to the coding style described by
   `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_. PEP8 is one of
   the standard worldwide stylistic conventions for coding in Python.

-  Class and function docstrings should follow the `numpydoc
   conventions <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard>`_.

-  Further, Landlab-specific advice for developing your own components
   can be found in the :ref:`component development guide <dev_contributing>`.

Many modern text editors, e.g., `Atom <https://atom.io>`_, provide interactive tools to
examine your code as you edit it and highlight where it diverges from
standards.


Style enforcement
-----------------

All tools used for development are specified in our `environment-dev.yml` file.
If you followed the
:ref:`developer installation instructions <developer_install>` you have
everything you need in the `landlab_dev` conda environment.

Currently we check for all the `flake8
violations <https://pycodestyle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes>`_
and `pycodestyle
violations <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/error-codes.html>`_
except for (as defined in our ``setup.cfg``)

* E203: whitespace before
* E501: line too long (n > 88 characters)
* W503: line break before binary operator

To format files to meet these standards, we recommend using
`isort <https://pypi.org/project/isort/>`_ +
`black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_.

You can run

.. code-block:: bash

   $ make pretty

from the main landlab directory in a terminal to run both
`isort <https://pypi.org/project/isort/>`_ and
`black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_ on your code.

To check if your files meet the standards that are enforced under
continuous integration, we use
`flake8 <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_. You can run

.. code-block:: bash

   make lint

from the top level directory or

.. code-block:: bash

   flake8 <file-to-check>
.. _dependencies:

==================================
How Landlab Specifies Dependencies
==================================

The Landlab package dependencies are found in the top-level directory file
``requirements.txt``.

The ``setup.py`` file looks to this file and reads it when compiling the
package. In this way, we only state the dependencies in one location.

In addition to the core set of dependencies, development with Landlab, and
common use of Landlab (e.g., running the notebooks) may have additional
dependencies. These dependencies are described in the following files:

- ``requirements-notebooks.txt`` indicates dependencies for running the notebooks.
- ``requirements-testing.txt`` indicates dependencies for running tests.
- ``requirements-dev.txt`` indicates dependencies for development (less building the documentation).

We provide two convenience environment files that address the two most common
use cases.

- ``environment.yml`` specifies an environment which installs a Landlab binary
  and all of the notebook dependencies.
- ``environment-dev.yml`` specifies an environment with all development
  dependencies.

If a developer wants to build the documentation locally there are some
additional dependencies. We do not include these in ``requirements-dev.txt``
because it is uncommon for developers to need to build the docs locally.

An environment specifying documentation-building requirements can be found at
``landlab/docs/environment.yml``.
.. _landlab_develop_with_git:

================
Develop with Git
================

*This information is intended to help users who have downloaded the
Landlab source code from Github, and intend to develop new components for
Landlab, or otherwise make changes to the code base. Here we illustrate
a few additional code management techniques using git and Github, which
we hope will help you develop for Landlab in a more efficient, faster,
more organised way.*

If you've installed Landlab from the source code, you've already
interacted with the git code management and version control systems, and
with Github, which is built onto the basic git framework. However, this
same framework offers you powerful ways to organise and track the change
you make to the code after install, and to plug any changes you make
back into the main code base for Landlab.

Your **fork** of Landlab is your starting point for all modifications to
the code. However, you can create *branches* from your master fork in
which you will actually modify code. The great advantage of this system
is that you can have several different branches running in parallel,
each aiming to complete a particular objective. The master version of
the code is not changed until you *merge* your completed branch back
into the master. If you decide that changes you're making are actually
unhelpful or redundant, you can easily roll them back - either by
individually reverting each committed change, or by deleting the whole
branch.

`This <http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/>`_ is a nice, simple
guide to the git command line tools. All this functionality is also
available through the Github app.

*Note: Github provides a nice GUI interface for using git called "Github
Desktop". This provides all the functionality described below in a form
that avoids the command line, if that sounds like something you'd
prefer.*

Branching with git
------------------

Making a new branch
```````````````````

Before making any changes to your code, you should create a new branch.

Update your mirror with any upstream changes you don't have:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git fetch upstream

If using git at the command line, make the new branch like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git branch name-of-branch upstream/master
   $ git checkout name-of-branch

From the Github app, you can do the same thing with the "branching"
button in the top line. A nice feature of the app is it shows you
graphically how your active branch currently differs from the master
branch - when you branched it, and when changes were committed to both
branches.

You will probably want to choose a descriptive name for your new branch
so that you and others will remember what it is you are intending to do
with your branch (for example, bugfix-for-that-major-problem, or
add-that-cool-feature).

You can create branches from branches!

If changes appear in the master and you want to also have them in your
active branch, you can update your active branch from the master with

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git pull

or with the "Update from master" button in the app.

Pushing changes from your local machine to your fork on Github
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

If you want to keep a copy of the files you have modified or created on
your branches on your public GitHub page for Landlab (you probably do as
this will serve as a file backup) you need to tell git to push changes
to your github repo. This is done with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git push --set-upstream origin name-of-branch

In the app, the same functionality is achieved by first "publishing"
your branch (creating it on your page within the github.com central
repository), then using the "sync" button to send the files to the
central github.com servers.

On your Landlab GitHub page you will now be able to toggle between your
various branches to see the code you have committed. The app also lets
you see the structure of your branches on your local machine.

Committing changes and merging branches back in
```````````````````````````````````````````````

Changes you make to your code are "saved" in git when you commit them to
your branch. Save your files, then at the command line

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git commit -m "Text describing the changes"

Again, the app provides the same functionality, but with the added bonus
that it shows you what the changes you've made since your last commit
actually are. Click on the "X Uncommitted Changes" button at the top
centre, and see which files have changed and what's happened. Pick the
files for which you want to store the changes as part of this commit,
type text describing the change in the boxes, then hit "Commit to
my-branch-name". If you go to History, you can see a record of all past
changes in the branch. You can then use git to travel "back in time" and
review what the code was like at any time in the past!

Note that files that you do not explicitly ask git to track (either by
clicking the checkbox next to the file in the GUI or by using
``git add``) are not tracked — and thus not sent to the github.com
central servers when you push changes.

Once you're happy with your branch, and the code is fully functional
again, it's time to merge it back into the master. This procedure
generally works best if you first pull any changes from the main Landlab
master branch (not just the master branch on your fork) into your active
branch, and resolve any conflicts there (so you don't mess up the
master). To do this, refer to the documentation on
:ref:`updating your fork from the master fork<updating>`.
Once you've done that pull, in git at the command line, make the master
your active branch again then *merge* the branch:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git checkout master
   $ git merge my-branch-name

In the app, create the merge by making a "pull request" using the button
in the top right. The process is fairly self explanatory, and provides a
preview of whether there will be any conflicts. Once you've created the
merge, click through the hyperlink and merge it into the master on the
website using the prominent green button. On your local machine, sync
your master branch to pick up the changes locally.

Pulling changes from your fork to the Landlab master fork
---------------------------------------------------------

Once you've completed whatever modifications you were working on with
Landlab, we'd like to incorporate your changes back into the main code
of Landlab so everyone can benefit from your enhancements. This is done
by creating a *pull request* from your fork into the Landlab master
fork. This is basically the inverse process you use to update your fork
from the master fork, as described :ref:`here<updating>`
(but in this case, one of us will review your changes before it gets
merged in).

Perform this procedure through the Github website. Go to the github page
for your fork, and click the green "New pull request" button at the top.
The next page shows you which branch on which fork (the "head") will be
merged into which other branch and fork (the "base"). These details
should all be correct as shown. There may well be conflicts reported on
this page. If there are, consider
:ref:`updating your fork from the master fork<updating>`
before finalising the request. Once you're ready to go, click the next
"Create pull request" green button. You'll be redirected to a discussion
page for your request, and it will be visible to all of the admins for
the main Landlab fork - one of whom will review your changes and
actually make the merge (*please don't do this yourself!*).

If you're confused by this process, just create the request, and one of
us will see it and come to help you. You can create comments on your
request from the website at any time after you've made it.


Troubleshooting
---------------

What do I do if my pull request cannot be automatically merged?
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Get the latest upstream/master and go to the `master` branch. Remember,
*do not develop here*.  Always develop in a feature branch. Merge the lastest
upstream master with your master

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git fetch upstream
  $ git checkout master
  $ git merge upstream/master

Go to the branch on which you are developing and merge the lastest upstream
master with your branch

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git checkout <branch_name>
  $ git merge upstream/master

Fix the conflicts. Do this by hand or with a merge editor. This is where you
decide how to integrate the conflicting changes. Since only you know what and
why you made the changes you did, this can only be done by you

.. code-block:: bash


  $ git mergetool

After everything has been fixed, commit the changes and push the changes to
the repository.  The pull request will automatically be updated

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git commit
  $ git push

===============================
How to create a Landlab release
===============================

The Release Checklist
---------------------

1. Go to GitHub and use it to create a pull request that brings the
   changes associated with `landlab/landlab/master` into
   `landlab/landlab/release`.

2. Assuming the continuous integration from step 1 passes, merge the pull
   request into `landlab/landlab/release`.

3. Next, decide what new version number is appropriate
   based on `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_.

   This can either be done locally or on the GitHub website. Here are
   instructions to do this locally:

   In the `landlab/landlab` repository, checkout the `release` branch and tag it.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ git tag vX.X.X

   Then, push your tag on `landlab/landlab/release` to the remote.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ git push --tags

4. This will trigger both standard Landlab CI and a deploy stage that uploads
   wheels to PyPI. A new PR will be autogenerated in the landlab-feedstock on
   conda-forge.

   * Assuming its tests pass, merge the PR autogenerated in the landlab-feedstock.

   * Verify the builds on PyPI and on conda-forge.

5. Now tag the current version of `master` with a "-dev" and push the tag.

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ git tag vX.X.X-dev
       $ git push --tags

Notes
-----

1. Although you can create such a tag on any branch, releases should **only**
   come from the ``release`` branch. Make sure that when you create a tag
   you are doing so on ``release`` (and all your changes are committed).

2. Landlab follows `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_
   rules for version assignment and formatting. Please stick to them.

.. _dev_ci:

================================
Continuous Integration Practices
================================

Before merging any changes into the Landlab trunk, *all* unit tests (including
doctests) should be passing. In addition, any new features added to Landlab
should have an associated set of unit tests to verify that the new features
are working properly.

Landlab uses `Travis <https://travis-ci.org>`_ for continuous integration
testing on OSX and Linux. The `landlab page on Travis <https://travis-ci.org/landlab/landlab>`_
shows the latest testing results. A new set of tests are executed whenever
any changes are pushed to the Landlab repository and with every pull request.
We currently run test suites for Python versions 3.6 and 3.7 (soon to include 3.8).

Continuous integration for Windows is done on
`Appveyor <https://ci.appveyor.com>`_ and also tests for the same
Python versions as OSX and Linux.

Once you send a pull request from GitHub, you will be taken to the Landlab
pull request page and all unit tests are run. You will see the status
of the unit tests next to your latest commit description. If you see a green
check, all tests passed and your changes can be merged! However, if you see
an ex there was a problem running the tests. If you believe your changes are
responsible for the failures, please fix them until the tests pass. Note that
you do not need to send a new pull request after committing for fixes. They
will be added to the current pull request and the tests automatically rerun.

You can also run unit tests locally in the top `landlab` directory and typing

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pytest

Note that this will test whatever version of landlab you have installed,
which may or may not be the one you are working on in your current working
directory. These test will not work with numpy 1.14.

Additional options for running tests are provided :ref:`here<testing>`

TODO: Add information about coverage here.
.. _writing_tests:

================================================================
Writing docstring and unit tests for your component (or utility)
================================================================

All contributed code should be well tested. This should be done through both
doctests and standard unit tests using `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_.

All public functions, classes, methods, etc. must have a docstring that follows
the `numpydoc <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_
conventions. Docstring tests should be short, easy-to-read tests that are
instructive to a user. These tests are included as examples in the Landlab
:ref:`Reference Manual <landlab>`.

Every ``.py`` file must contain a module-level docstring at the top of the file
that describes what the purpose of the file is.

Unit tests should be more extensive than doctests and give your new code
thorough testing. Ideally your tests will cover what happens within every
``if``, ``elif``, or ``else``, and every ``try`` or ``except`` block. These
test will also verify that if a bad parameter value is passed, that the correct
type of error is raised.

Additionally, unless there is a specific reason your component or utility can
only work with one Landlab grid type, the tests should verify that it can work
with multiple model grid types (verifying that the model works with both `
`HexModelGrid`` and ``RasterModelGrid`` is a good place to start).

Your unit tests should verify that the component or utility you are creating
does exactly what it is expected to do. This means you will probably want to
create a very small (e.g. 5x5) model grid and hand calculate what the correct
answer is. Then use *assertions* to ensure that your code reproduces that
answer exactly. It is very important to not just test that the code reproduces
the first answer you get. Instead you should construct the test so that you
**know** what the right answer is.

The `numpy testing <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/routines.testing.html>`_
functions are useful for making comparison between actual and expected results
(e.g. to assert that one array is equal to another array). The
`pytest testing tools <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/assert.html>`_ are
useful for things like asserting that providing a particular set of values to
a function or component will raise a specific type of error.

Unit tests must be discoverable by `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_.
This means that the unit tests should be in folders within the ``test``
directory, in ``.py`` files that start with the name `test`
and within functions with names that begin with the word ``test``.

Thus, a file to provide the unit tests for your component would be called
``test_my_component_name.py`` file, located in the directory
``tests\components\my_component_name\``. The inside of it might look like:

.. code-block:: python

   # test_my_component_name.py
   # numpy.testing and pytest are two modules commonly used
   # for testing whether your code behaves as expected.
   # import what you need from landlab

   def test_something_about_my_component():
       """Make a one-line docstring that describes your unit test."""
       # do things to set up for your test like make a model grid.

       # make your test and assert that you get the right answer
.. _dev_troubleshooting:

====================================================
Troubleshoot Installation and Development Challenges
====================================================

I updated my working version and now it is broken. What do I do?
----------------------------------------------------------------

One possibility is that the landlab requirements changed between when
you originally installed landlab and when you updated landlab. To
address this, re-run the following lines and then test the installation.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda install --yes --file=requirements.txt
   $ pip install -e .

.. _what_do_if_cant_merge_pr:

What do I do if my pull request cannot be automatically merged?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Get the latest upstream/master and go to the master branch. Remember,
*do not develop here*. Always develop in a feature branch. Merge the
lastest upstream master with your master:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git fetch upstream
   $ git checkout master
   $ git merge upstream/master

Go to the branch on which you are developing and merge the lastest
upstream master with your branch:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git checkout <branch_name>
   $ git merge upstream/master

Fix the conflicts. Do this by hand or with a merge editor. This is where
you decide how to integrate the conflicting changes. Since only you know
what and why you made the changes you did, this can only be done by you:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git merge tool

After everything has been fixed, commit the changes and push the changes
to the repository. The pull request will automatically be updated:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git commit
   $ git push

Most of these steps have equivalents in the Github app. Use the
"changes" pane to identify where conflicts exist in your version, then
resolve them one by one. When you're done, commit then sync the
un-conflicted version's changes as if they were any other.

I'm seeing errors about Cython when I try to run my code/import Landlab. It used to be fine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Very occasionally, local code updates or rebasing can break the compiled
code that lives in your local developer's install. *Provided you used to
have a fully working Landlab install*, you can fix this by just calling
again from the main Landlab local folder

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install -e .

as described above in the main text. If this is happening when you call
this install function rather than when you try to actually run some
code/import Landlab, see immediately below.

I see errors about Cython when I try to *install* Landlab
---------------------------------------------------------

If you see errors referring to Cython when you try to run
``pip install -e .``, it indicates you have a problem with your
local compilers. This can happen both the first time you ever try this,
or also subsequently, apparently at random. On a Mac, check first that
you have the free Apple Xcode app (get it from the app store). If you do
have it already, typically this means Xcode has updated itself (this can
happen automatically without your knowledge!) and needs you to
re-authorize its permissions. Open the Xcode app manually, follow the
instructions it will give you, then try the install for Landlab again.
On a PC? Try updating Anaconda.

I'm still confused
------------------

If you are having problems when installing, testing or running Landlab,
please visit our :ref:`Troubleshooting page <troubleshooting>`.

The Landlab development team will be happy to hear from you. Find contact
information :ref:`here <contact>`.
When reporting your problem (in either place) we recommend that you provide a
minimal, complete, and verifiable example which will help the development team
and involved users reproduce your problem and determine a solution.
`This page from Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example>`_ provides
some background on how to make a minimal, complete, and verifiable example.
.. _compile_in_windows:

==============================================================
Installing compilers for building Landlab on a Windows machine
==============================================================

On a Mac, all the necessary C++ compilers needed by Python to build new C++
modules from source code are provided simply by installing the Xcode app from
the app store. On a PC you will get these compilers from Build Tools for Visual
Studio.

This process is only necessary if you want to build Landlab directly from its
source code on your PC. Some parts of Landlab use compiled C++ code to
accelerate things, via Cython. If you are using a binary install, as described
:ref:`here <anaconda_install_landlab>`, you don't need to do this.

Getting the compilers
---------------------

Anaconda provides some of the necessary compilers. Install it first.

The easiest way to discover if you have other compiler issues is to attempt an
install! Follow the
:ref:`developer installation instructions <developer_install>`
until you attempt to perform the developer installation

.. code-block:: bash

 $ pip install -e .

If you have compiler issues, you will see an error message. On April 24, 2019
on a clean install on Windows 10 this error message said: ::

  building 'landlab.ca.cfuncs' extension
  error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required. Get it with "Build Tools for
  Visual Studio": https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

Go to the `specified website <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/>`_
and download the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler. In April 2019 this was done by
first downloading "Build Tools for Visual Studio". Then when installing Build
Tools there were options for what exactly should be installed. One of these was
the Visual Studio C++ compilers. Once installed, a restart was required and
landlab compiled as expected.

Getting the code from Github
----------------------------

Landlab development takes place in your own *fork* of the main Landlab
repository. A fork is a *mirror* of the repository and is hosted on your
personal GitHub account. You will use this fork for developing new
Landlab features. Your changes will migrate to the core repository (for
review and merging) by requesting that the main repository "pull" in
your changes. This is known as a pull request and is facilitated through
the GitHub website.

You will only need to do this once for each project to which you want to
contribute. Github has some great documentation on `how to create a
fork <https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo>`_. We outline
below the basic steps as applied to Landlab.

Create a Github account
```````````````````````

1. You can create a GitHub account by going to the `GitHub
   website <https://github.com>`_.
2. If you haven't already, `Install
   Git <https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git>`_. Note that if
   you are using a mac with OS lower than 10.7, we have found it
   difficult to setup git, and you may want to upgrade your OS.
   Alternatively, you can do this in a more user-friendly fashion by
   installing the `Github graphical user
   interface <https://desktop.github.com>`_ for your OS, which comes
   packaged with git for command line by default, and also lets you
   perform many git functions (updating your code, pushing changes back
   to github…) without having to deal with the command line interface.
3. Configure your account to allow write access. If you choose to
   install the git GUI, then it will set-up an SSH key for you. If you
   install on the command line, you might need some help with this, see
   `Generating SSH Keys on
   GitHub <https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh>`_.
4. If you want to ensure the ssh key is set correctly, go to your home
   page on github and hit the account settings (wrench and screwdriver
   button in upper right corner). On this page hit the SSH keys tab on
   the left. This should show that you have a key for whatever computer
   you are currently working on. Note that you may have more than one
   key if you have installed git on more than one computer with the same
   user account.

Creating your own fork of Landlab
`````````````````````````````````

The following steps will create a fork of the Landlab repository under
your GitHub account.

1. Sign in to your GitHub account.
2. Go to the `Landlab home page <https://github.com/landlab/landlab>`_
   on GitHub.
3. Click the fork button in the upper-right corner of the page.

Once completed, you will be redirected to the home page for your own
copy of Landlab (github.com/UserName/landlab).

Cloning your fork to your computer
``````````````````````````````````

You can clone the fork (that lives on the Github website) locally to
your computer either using the Github app (the GUI), or directly from
the command line using git. If you've never used git before, the app is
probably the way to go.

Using the GUI/app
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Sign in to github on the GUI.
2. Hit on your account on the left side of the GUI.
3. This will show you your fork of Landlab. Hit the clone option next to
   the fork. This will download the Landlab package to your local
   computer. If you are on a windows machine, this will put Landlab in
   the Documents/GitHub folder. If you are on a mac, you are given the
   option of where to put the downloaded Landlab package.

Alternatively, you can also clone your fork in the GUI directly through
the website. Navigate to the page for your fork on the web
(UserName/landlab) and hit the "Clone in Desktop" button
(monitor-with-downward-arrow) on the top/right hand side of the page.
Make sure you have the GUI installed and set up on your machine before
you try this for the most pain-free results. Also ensure you clone your
fork, not the main development version of Landlab (i.e., the version at
github.com/your-user-name/landlab, not the version at
github.com/landlab/landlab).

Using the command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following commands from a terminal of your choice.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone git@github.com:your-user-name/landlab.git
   $ cd landlab
   $ git remote add upstream git://github.com/landlab/landlab.git
.. _updating:

====================
Keep Landlab Updated
====================


To take advantage of new features and new library additions, we recommend you
**update Landlab** fairly frequently. From time to time you should fetch
commits to the "trunk" version of Landlab that you don't have in your forked
working copy. This is also important to keep your branch up to date with
improvements/bug elimination happening as part of core Landlab development.

Before you begin, we recommend you review this `GitHub page describing syncing
a fork <https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork>`_.

Through the command line, you should be able to update your Landlab repository
from master using the following command

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git fetch upstream

A common reason why this might not work is if you haven't set the remotes
correctly. This
`GitHub page <https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/managing-remote-repositories>`_ on
managing remotes might be helpful.

If we have added a dependency, you may see an import error. Similarly, if we
have added a dependency, you may see some tests break. A likely fix is to
ensure you have all the requirements specified in the Landlab development
environment described by the `environment-dev.yml` file

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda env update landlab_dev  --file environment-dev.yml
   $ conda activate landlab_dev
   $ pip install -e .

The first of these installs any new requirements for development. The second
line activates the environment (called "landlab_dev").  The third will verify
that all requirements are met and recompile Landlab.

If the Cython code has changed since you last updated, you will probably see
errors associated with files named `cfuncs.pyx` (or similar). These changes
require that you recompile your code. This can be done by executing the
following from within the top level landlab folder (which contains the
`setup.py` file)

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install -e .

If none of these options work, please make an issue.

Additional issues
-----------------
If you have been developing code and making commits to the ``master`` branch on
your fork, this may not work. It is for this reason that we highly recommend
you develop on a development branch.

Still having problems? This probably means that some time early in our
development cycle you installed Landlab with one of our old procedures. The clue
will be that you still have a (very out of date!) copy of the Landlab code
base somewhere on your machine. Another possibility is that you've previously
tried a
:ref:`developer install <developer_install>`.
This procedure will also work in this case.

Try this:

In a terminal, navigate to the top level directory of
that old code, the one that contains the file *setup.py*.
This is likely to be *your_home_dir*/landlab, if you installed with git
and left all the defaults as is.
Then

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip uninstall landlab #just to be on the safe side, may get errors again
    $ python setup.py develop -u

This should remove the install, **if** you installed as a developer.

Still getting error messages? This means we're going to have to excise the
old Landlab install "by hand". You're looking to remove any reference to
Landlab that lives inside *your_python_install*/lib/python2.7/site-packages.
**Do this only after you've exhausted other possibilities, above**, as
packages like pip will get annoyed with you if you start manually deleting
their files if they installed them in the first place. To minimize the risk,
once again make sure you have just run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip uninstall landlab

Then find your Python directory with

.. code-block:: bash

    $ which python

Find that folder, ignoring everything after and including the subfolder
*bin*. Instead, go to *your_install*/lib/python2.7/site-packages. In here,
you should find one (or more) folders referring to Landlab, e.g.,
*landlab* or *landlab.egg-link*, or some other reference to
*landlab.egg*. Delete these. Leave everything else as it is!

If you are running an Anaconda distribution, we now recommend you replace your
pip install with a conda install. Simply do this

.. code-block:: bash

     $ pip uninstall landlab
     $ conda install landlab -c landlab

You will then be able to update Landlab along with the rest of your conda
packages

.. code-block:: bash

     $ conda update --all -c landlab

If you prefer to remain with pip, try another pip install

.. code-block:: bash

     $ pip install landlab

This should now take.

*Still* having problems? There are probably multiple
versions of Python on your machine interfering with each other. Solve
that problem first (see
:ref:`here <correcting_install_paths>` for
some help), then return to trying to install Landlab.

**Without using command line:**

You can't do the equivalent in the GitHub app, but you can do it through the
website—though it is a bit more involved. Navigate to the
`master Landlab fork <https://github.com/landlab/landlab>`_. Hit the big green
"new pull request" button. Hit the "compare across forks" hyperlink. You now
want to set the *base fork* dropdown menu to your local Landlab
(`UserName/landlab`), and leave the *head fork* as it is (`landlab/landlab`).
Leave both the *base* and *compare* boxes set to `master`, as they should
already be. The site will then have a think, then report back to you whether it
can perform an automatic merge (in green or yellow, just below the dropdown
boxes), and also what the differences between these two versions are (scroll
down).

Take a quick look at the commits list to reassure yourself you got the "base"
and "head" versions the right way round (DH struggles with this every time…).
Presuming you got the green "able to merge" dialogue, now just fill in the pull
request box with a title (e.g., "updating local Landlab fork from master") and
hit "Create pull request." This will take you to a page showing the open
request. Confirm it and actually perform the code update in your fork by
scrolling down and hitting the green "Merge pull request" button. You'll then
need to sync your local version with the fork that just updated on the Github
servers—easiest through the app, using the "Sync" button in the top right (make
sure you're in the local master branch).

If you didn't get the green "able to merge" button, it means some of your local
changes conflict with what's in the main Landlab repo. Don't panic! This is
fine. Just follow the instructions to press ahead. Conflicts can be resolved
manually later in the process—conflicting sections of the code will be tagged
with a distinctive >>>>>>> symbology, and you can find and modify them by hand.
See :ref:`here<what_do_if_cant_merge_pr>`
for more documentation on this.
.. _developer_install:

===================================
Developer Installation Instructions
===================================

If you intend to modify the Landlab code base, including design of new
components, you will want to install Landlab directly from the source
code. This way, when you modify the code, the changes you have made will
be reflected immediately in your Landlab library. This section provides
information on how to do this.

Installation Steps and Resources
--------------------------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   fork
   install
   test
   updating
   troubleshooting_install
   installing_windows_compiler

**Note:** For dev work, we actively recommend Anaconda over the
Enthought Python Distribution, especially on Windows machines. This is
because it ships with a working compiler already associated with Python,
whereas the EPD does not. On a Mac, this is less important as the Xcode
app (available through iTunes) gives you the necessary compilers
instead—install it now if you don't have it! If you choose to use the
EPD on a Windows machine, however, you'll need to install separately
either Visual Basic or MinGW and successfully associate them with your
Python install. See :ref:`this page<compile_in_windows>` on Windows Compilers.

Make a GitHub Issue to contact the development team if you're really struggling.
But unless you're really invested in Canopy and the EPD, uninstalling it and
replacing with Anaconda is probably the more stress-free way to go.*

*Either way, you'll need a working C++ compiler running alongside Python
to be able to perform a full developer install. You'll see errors
referring to* :ref:`Cython <cython>` *if you
don't have working compiler when calling* ``pip install -e .``
*(see* :ref:`the developer install instructions <dev_install_install>` *).*

Working with your local version of Landlab
------------------------------------------

Obviously, feel free to just dive into modifying the code, but your life
in the future will be a bit easier if you follow some basic
recommendations for good work flow with git forks and branches. Even if
you have a working knowledge of using git in a collaborative project, we
highly recommend that you review :ref:`this section<landlab_develop_with_git>`
of the documentation to get a sense of how to track
modifications to your version of Landlab in a way that makes it easy to
(a) get updates to Landlab made by the development team and other
contributors and (b) contribute improvements and new features you
develop back to the community.

For information about our in-house code
formatting conventions and standards, see :ref:`here<style_enforcement>`.
.. _testing:

=========================================
Verify that Landlab is Working with Tests
=========================================

Testing Your Installation
-------------------------

In order to test your installation you'll need to install the
`pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ package that is used to run the
tests. This is included in the conda environment in the
:ref:`developer_install <dev_install_install>`.

Alternatively, you can install pytest with conda:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda install pytest

Once ``pytest`` has been installed navigate to the main Landlab
directory (the one with ``setup.py`` in it) and type into a terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pytest

This command will collect and run all of the tests.

More Advanced Testing Options
`````````````````````````````

If you want to only want to test one part of Landlab:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pytest path/to/directory/you/want/to/test

Landlab's code (and thus docstring tests) are located in the directory
``landlab/landlab`` and the Landlab unit tests are located in the directory
``landlab/tests``. The directory structure is the same for both directories, so
to run the doctests and the unit tests for a particular part of landlab, one
can use the ``*`` wildcard. For example, to test one particular component:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pytest */components/<name of component directory>

Testing the Notebooks
`````````````````````

Because the Landlab notebooks take a lot longer to test, the default
configuration of pytest does not evaluate them. To test the entire package,
including the notebooks, evaluate:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pytest --run-notebook

Testing with Coverage
`````````````````````

You may also want to see the code coverage of different parts of
Landlab. To do this, you'll first need to install
`pytest-cov <https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda install pytest-cov

Then execute

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pytest landlab --doctest-modules --cov=landlab --cov-report term-missing

from the main Landlab directory.

This will run the tests and print the coverage statistics (including the
missing line numbers) to the terminal.

As above, you can also run the coverage tools for a more specific
directory. For example, to run them for your current directory you could
execute

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pytest . --doctest-modules --cov=. --cov-report term-missing

or to run them for a specific directory (for example, the
erosion_deposition submodule) stored as an environment variable you
would do the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ TEST_DIR=landlab/components/erosion_deposition/
   $ pytest $TEST_DIR --doctest-modules --cov=$TEST_DIR --cov-report term-missing
.. _dev_install_install:

===========================
Install Landlab from Source
===========================

Before You Begin
----------------

1.  Ensure you have installed with Xcode from the
    Apple app store (macs) or :ref:`installed a working C++ compiler on your
    machine (PCs) <compile_in_windows>` before proceeding
    with your developer install. **You should also update your Python
    distribution!** For Anaconda, use

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ conda update --all

    (two dashes), and then separately,

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ conda update setuptools

    (the second being essential!) from your terminal.

2.  Ensure that you have removed other versions of Landlab from your computer.

    If you've previously used pip to install Landlab, we recommend
    you take that version off first. At a command prompt, use the command

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ pip uninstall landlab

    If you have used ``conda`` to install a prebuilt version of Landlab, you
    should uninstall that too.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ conda uninstall landlab

    If you're not sure whether you have or not in the past, there's no harm
    doing both of these uninstall commands.

Install
-------

Now that you have a working copy of the Landlab code on you computer,
you need to install it. To install Landlab in developer mode, navigate
to the root Landlab folder (it will be landlab with a small ``l`` and
will contain the file ``setup.py``) and run the commands below.

Landlab has a number of dependencies to run, test, and develop with. These are
described in more detail :ref:`here <dependencies>`. We have created a conda
environment file which contains everything you will need for development.

Read more about
`conda environments <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-environments>`_.
on the conda webpage.

The next step is it create this environment, called *landlab_dev*.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda create -n landlab_dev python
   $ conda install -n landlab_dev --file=requirements.txt -c conda-forge
   $ conda install -n landlab_dev --file=requirements-testing.txt -c conda-forge
   $ conda install -n landlab_dev --file=requirements-notebooks.txt -c conda-forge
   $ conda install -n landlab_dev --file=requirements-dev.txt -c conda-forge

The conda environment described by ``environment-dev.yml`` contains the minimal
set of dependencies necessary to run the Landlab tests and notebooks, and keep
the codebase clean and tidy. It may not include some of your favorite
development tools (e.g., spyder). See below for how to install additional
packages into the conda environment.

In addition, this environment does not have everything needed to build the
documentation. These requirements are specified in the file
``landlab/docs/environment.yml`` or the ``requirements-docs.txt``
requirements file.

Activate that environment so that you will be using that version of python and
all of the dependencies you just installed.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda activate landlab_dev

Install Landlab on your computer in such a way that Python always
imports Landlab from the working copy you just cloned. This ensures that
any changes you make to your copy of the code is seen by Python the
*next* time you import Landlab.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install -e .

Conda Environment Tips
----------------------

*   In order to use the ``landlab_dev`` environment created during installation,
    you will need to activate it every time you open a new terminal instance.
    Use the command: ``conda activate landlab_dev``.
*   If you use python tools for your work that are not in the conda environment
    but you have previously installed them on your computer (e.g., spyder),
    you will need to add them to the environment. Use the standard terminal
    calls to accomplish this.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda install name_of_package
   $ conda install name_of_package -c name_of_channel

Uninstall
---------

To uninstall your development version of Landlab (again from the root
``landlab/`` folder) run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip uninstall

With Landlab uninstalled, you will no longer be able to import Landlab
from outside the root folder of your working copy.
.. _teaching_tutorials:

Teaching Tutorials
==================

Landlab teaching tools
----------------------

This page describes the Jupyter Notebooks that implement Landlab for use in
teaching undergraduate and graduate courses. Jupyter Notebooks combine formatted
text with code that can be run. Students can run small parts of code bit by bit
as they follow along with the text.

The notebooks illustrate examples of physical processes implemented numerically.
These notebooks are designed to teach about processes. The notebooks are not
designed to teach students to code, or to teach students to use Landlab. No
coding experience is needed to successfully carry out these activities - just
the ability to read and a classroom introduction of the specific processes being
illustrated.

The notebooks are primarily designed for use as homework assignments or
laboratory assignments. However, they can be used to illustrate concepts
on-the-fly in the classroom.

The easiest way to see what is in the notebooks is through the
`Binder welcome page for the teaching notebooks <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=notebooks/teaching/welcome_teaching.ipynb>`_. This also allows you to run the notebooks online.

The notebooks can also be run locally by `installing Landlab <https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/index.html>`_ on your computer.

For an introduction to using Jupyter Notebooks locally, see this `webpage <https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html>`_.
[Quick Summary: The way to launch a Jupyter notebook is to enter
'jupyter notebook' from a command line prompt. Jupyter notebooks can also be
launched from within Anaconda.]

More information
----------------

If you have suggestions on improving these notebooks and developing new ones,
or are having trouble running them, please leave us a question in our
`GitHub Issues page <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues>`_. Please make
sure you include that you are working with a Landlab Teaching Notebook and
include the name of the notebook and as much information as possible. If you
are getting an error, please taking a screenshot and upload it.

The development of these Notebooks has been made possible by the Landlab
project funded by the National Science Foundation (OAC 1450338 to N. Gasparini,
OAC 1450409 to G. Tucker, OAC 1450412 to E. Istanbulluoglu). 
.. _overland_flow_manual:

===================================
Overland Flow Component User Manual
===================================

Background on OverlandFlow component
------------------------------------

The Landlab OverlandFlow component implements a 2-D solution of the shallow water equations, following the algorithm of de Almeida et al., (2012). In this component, an explicit solution simulates a flood wave moving across a gridded terrain, capturing hydrodynamics throughout the system. At each point within the grid, surface water discharge is calculated based on physical properties. This component expands the hydrologic capabilities of Landlab by offering a nonsteady flow routing method as an alternative to the steady-state flow routing regimes found in many geomorphic or landscape evolution models
(such as the Landlab :py:class:`FlowAccumulator<landlab.components.flow_accum.FlowAccumulator>` component).


This User Manual describes how to instantiate, parameterize and plot data using the OverlandFlow component, using an example described in Adams et al., (in press, *Geoscientific Model Development*). For further information about the derivation of the algorithm used in this component, see: Bates et al., (2010) and de Almeida et al., (2012).

**Note**: Currently, the OverlandFlow component can only operate on a structured grid, and so all references to the grid below are specifically referring to the Landlab RasterModelGrid module.

*Prerequisites*: A working knowledge of the Python programming language (any version) and familiarity with the Python libraries NumPy and Matplotlib. A basic understanding of the Landlab modeling framework (Hobley et al., 2017) is also recommended.

Model parameters and variables
------------------------------

**Input parameters**

Parameters listed here are easily tuned by the model user. For a complete list, see
:py:mod:`here<landlab.components.overland_flow>`.

- **Alpha** : Weight on the adaptive time step, ranging between 0.2 - 0.7. For more information, see Hunter et al., (2005).
- **Manning's n** : An empirical value describing surface roughness. See Chow (1959).
- **Theta** : A weighting factor in the de Almeida et al., (2012) equation, suggested value between 0.8 and 0.9

**Model variables**

Variables listed here are updated by the component at the grid locations listed.

- **surface_water__discharge**, *link*, [m^2 s^-1] : At each link in grid, *surface_water__discharge* is calculated using the de Almeida et al., (2012) equation. Discharge is a function of the water depth, adaptive time step, surface water slope and Manning's roughness coefficient.
- **surface_water__depth**, *node*, [m] : At each node in the grid, *surface_water__depth* is updated using the *surface_water__discharge* on links connected to a given node.

Basic steps of an OverlandFlow model
------------------------------------

1. **Import the necessary libraries**: ``OverlandFlow`` is required. Optional libraries include the ``SinkFiller`` component, the Landlab plotting method ``imshow__grid``. Additional packages mentioned here include ``matplotlib.pyplot`` and ``numpy``.
2. **Defining the model domain**: The computational domain of an OverlandFlow model can only work on RasterModelGrid instances as of Landlab version 1.0.0.
3. **Setting the boundary conditions**: If a clipped watershed digital elevation model (DEM) from ArcGIS is imported in ASCII format, the method ``set_watershed_boundary_condition()`` can be used. Alternatively, ``fixed_link`` boundary conditions can be used for discharge inputs on links. Other boundary condition scenarios can be accommodated by setting individual nodes or edges of the grid using Landlab boundary condition handling.
4. **Pre-processing the DEM**: This step is *optional*. If a watershed DEM is used, ArcGIS "D8" pit-filling will not create a continuous network for the "D4" ``OverlandFlow`` algorithm. The ``SinkFiller`` component can pit fill for a "D4" network.
5. **Initializing the OverlandFlow component**: The instance of the ``OverlandFlow`` class is declared, and parameters are set by the user.
6. **Determining precipitation inputs**: A constant precipitation rate can be passed to the ``OverlandFlow`` class, where precipitation persists for the entire model run. Alternatively, a single event can be set within the time loop, and then water can drain from the system when the precipitation event is over.
7. **Time loop**: The main ``OverlandFlow`` methods are called, and grid variables are updated through time. Data can be saved for plotting or later analysis.

Step 1. Import the necessary libraries
``````````````````````````````````````

To build an OverlandFlow model, first the necessary Landlab components and utilities, as well as any necessary Python packages must be imported. Standard Python style dictates all import statements belong in the top of the driver file, after the module docstrings. In this simple example, the OverlandFlow model driver begins as follows:

.. code-block:: python

	"""overland_flow_driver.py

  OverlandFlow component example, initializing a 36 km^2 square watershed with a
  grid resolution of 30 m, from an ESRI ASCII file, simulating a 5 mm/hr rainfall
  intensity over 2 hours, the standard storm example from Adams et al.,
  in prep for Geoscientific Model Development

  Written by Jordan Adams, August 2016"""
  ## Landlab components
  from landlab.components import OverlandFlow, SinkFiller # SinkFiller is optional

  ## Landlab utilities
  from landlab.io import read_esri_ascii # OR from landlab import RasterModelGrid
  from landlab.plot import imshow_grid  # plotter functions are optional

  ## Additional Python packages
  import numpy as np
  from matplotlib import pyplot as plt # plotter functions are optional

To run the test case presented here, two components are needed. First is the required ``OverlandFlow`` component, which will be used to calculate surface water discharge and surface water depth across the model grid. Also presented here is the ``SinkFiller`` component, which can be used optionally to pre-process the DEM. The ``SinkFiller`` component is described in more detail in **Step 4** of this Users Manual.

To create a model domain, a Landlab RasterModelGrid instance must be initialized. In this example, the Landlab input/output suite of tools is used to read in a DEM that is formatted as an ESRI ASCII file ``read_esri_ascii``). Alternatively, a model domain can be manually created by the user. Both of these methods are described in detail in **Step 2** of this Users Manual.

Other Landlab utilities used in this example are the plotting library ``imshow_grid``, which is a utility that can plot a Landlab grid instance and data field in map view, as described in the **Plotting and visualization** section in this Users Manual.

Finally, additional Python packages are imported. In this example, both packages are dependencies of Landlab, which means they are required for Landlab installation and as such, should already be present on the user's machine. The scientific computing library NumPy is used for mathematical operations, and the matplotlib library is used for plotting model output.

Step 2. Defining the model domain
`````````````````````````````````

As previously stated, the algorithm used in the OverlandFlow component was derived to work on remotely-sensed data and, as such, only works on the RasterModelGrid instance in Landlab (e.g. Bates et al., 2010, de Almeida et al., 2012). Shown here is an example of a Landlab raster grid:

.. image:: images/RasterGrid_Directions.png
		:width: 300px

**Figure** 1: Example of a Landlab RasterModelGrid instance. Each RasterModelGrid is composed of 3 core elements: nodes, which are points in (x, y) space; cells, a polygon with an area around a node; and links, ordered lines which connect neighboring pairs of node that store directionality.

There are two ways to implement a RasterModelGrid that work with Landlab: reading in remotely-sensed data from a DEM with ``read_esri_ascii()``, or manually setting a generic structured grid using the RasterModelGrid library. Both of these methods are described in detail below.

Reading in a watershed DEM
..........................

Landlab can easily interact with DEM data output by ESRI's ArcGIS software. In this example, the DEM 'Square_TestBasin.asc' represents a single watershed. Reading in the data takes two lines of code, outlined here:

.. code-block:: python

	watershed_dem = 'Square_TestBasin.asc'
	(rmg, z) = read_esri_ascii(watershed_dem, name='topographic__elevation')

In this example, the watershed DEM is read in by the ``read_esri_ascii()`` method, and the elevation data from the DEM is automatically assigned to the Landlab data field ``topographic__elevation``, for use by the components.

Setting up a generic RasterModelGrid
....................................

The alternative to reading in a watershed DEM is to set the RasterModelGrid instance manually:

.. code-block:: python

	rmg = RasterModelGrid((number_of_node_rows, number_of_node_columns), dx)
  z = user_defined_elevation_data        # length of number_of_nodes
  rmg['node']['topographic__elevation'] = z

This example assumes that the model users knows the following information: the number of grid rows (``number_of_grid_rows``), the number of grid columns (``number_of_grid_columns``), the grid resolution (``dx``) and some elevation data for each node. Here, the user must manually set the elevation data. When passing elevation data to the  ``topographic__elevation`` field, the length of ``user_defined_elevation_data`` **must** be equal to the number of nodes in the grid (which can be found using a command such as: ``rmg.number_of_nodes``.

Step 3. Setting the boundary conditions
```````````````````````````````````````

Landlab contains several methods which can set and update boundary conditions
at *node* and *link* grid elements. When modeling water flow across a grid, a
user needs to predetermine locations where water can and cannot flow. If a user
reads in a single watershed DEM, (as described in **Step 2**), there is a
utility within Landlab that can handle the specific boundary conditions needed
to control flow:

.. code-block:: python

	rmg.set_watershed_boundary_condition(z, nodata_values=-9999.)

By definition, a watershed has only one outlet, or open boundary location,
and therefore all other nodes surrounding the watershed will be closed, or
no flux, boundaries.
The ``set_watershed_boundary_condition()`` method reads the gridded elevation
data, (``z``), identifies the watershed outlet and sets it to an open boundary
(identified by the grid attribute ``grid.BC_NODE_IS_FIXED_VALUE`` in Landlab).
An open boundary allows flux to leave the modeling domain.  Additionally, this
methods also identifies all NODATA nodes (given a default value of -9999) and
sets them to closed, or no flux, boundaries.

**Note**: As of Landlab version 1.0.0., this method only works on single
watersheds, and so assumes that the watershed has been clipped in ArcGIS and
has only one outlet point.

Other boundary condition options
................................

There are other options for boundary condition handling that are more
appropriate for non-DEM modeling domains. (For a complete review of boundary
condition handling in Landlab, review Hobley et al., in submission for
*Earth Surface Dynamics* or Landlab
:ref:`boundary <api.grid.base.bcc>` condition documentation

Here, the ``FIXED_GRADIENT`` boundary condition is described. The
``set_nodata_nodes_to_fixed_gradient()`` method sets all NODATA nodes to
``FIXED_GRADIENT``, and all boundary links (links that connect core nodes
within the model domain to a fixed gradient nodes) are set to ``FIXED_LINK``
status. Then, boundary links can be updated with some input discharge value:

.. code-block:: python

	rmg.set_nodata_nodes_to_fixed_gradient(z)
	rmg.fixed_links = input_discharge_value

This boundary condition can be useful because of how the underlying algorithm in OverlandFlow (de Almeida et al., 2012) updates discharge at each time step. In this model, discharge is calculated as a function of the neighboring discharge values:

.. image:: images/deAlmeidaGridExample.png
		:width: 300px
		:align: center

**Figure 2**: The algorithm from de Almeida et al., (2012) uses discharge information on neighboring links to calculate discharge. Fixed link boundary conditions allow the user to set discharge on links along the boundary, so that the interior discharges can be updated using those manually-set fluxes.

In this example, calculating discharge on q\ :sub:`x` requires discharge values q\ :sub:`x-1` and q\ :sub:`x+1`. If a link is along the boundary of the domain, the default value is 0. Fixed link boundary statuses allow the user to manually update the discharge value at a boundary link, to simulate some influx of water discharge into the model domain.

If the user desires, these fixed links can also be updated to contain flux value of their nearest interior neighbor. Following the earlier example, if discharge q\ :sub:`x-1` is at on a fixed boundary link, it can be updated to contain the value of its neighboring discharge q\ :sub:`x`. This is done exclusively in the OverlandFlow component. The user simply needs to call  ``default_fixed_links = True`` when initializing the ``OverlandFlow`` component, as described in **Step 5**. This method prevents flow from exiting the edge of the watershed onto NODATA nodes, and does not set an outlet node by default. If the user wants to set an outlet node to an open boundary, that must be done manually, not described here.

Step 4. Pre-processing the DEM (*Optional*)
```````````````````````````````````````````

When modeling surface flow across a DEM and the user wants to ensure all water drains out of the system (that is, water is not trapped in pits or holes on the DEM surface), there must be a continuous flow path. In many applications, flow is allowed to exit a node in 8 directions ('D8'): the cardinal directions (East, North, West, South) and the diagonal directions (Northeast, Northwest, Southwest, Southeast). However, this model restricts flow to only the cardinal directions ('D4'). To create a continuous flow network, GIS applications often include a pit-filling regime to remove divots in the DEM surface so water can exit the pit and travel to the outlet. In ArcGIS, this pit-filling regime operates in 'D8':

.. image:: images/D8_vs_D4.png
		:width: 300px
		:align: center

**Figure 3**: Comparison of 'D8' and 'D4' flow routing methods. The key difference: in 'D8' methods, flow can move diagonally out of a given node.

However, in Landlab version 1.0.0., the OverlandFlow component is limited to the 'D4' regime. If a watershed DEM has been processed in ArcGIS, the flow network most likely follows a 'D8' path. When using the OverlandFlow component on a 'D8' network, the flow path may not be continuous.

To address this discrepancy, the SinkFiller component in Landlab has been developed to accommodate both 'D8' or 'D4' pit-filling on a DEM. Running this component can take some time, particularly on large grids, so it is *optional* to run the OverlandFlow component. This component can be applied to our DEM in two lines of code, initializing the SinkFiller component and running the ``fill_pits()`` method:

.. code-block:: python

	sf = SinkFiller(rmg, routing='D4', apply_slope=True, fill_slope=1.e-5)
	sf.fill_pits()


**Note**: For more information about the SinkFiller :py:class:`component <landlab.components.sink_fill.SinkFiller>`.

Step 5. Initializing the OverlandFlow component
```````````````````````````````````````````````

Most Landlab components are structured as a Python class. These classes are imported (as seen in **Step 1**) and then the user must create an instance of the class:

.. code-block:: python

	of = OverlandFlow(rmg, mannings_n=0.03, steep_slopes=True)

When the instance of the class is created, parameters are passed as keywords to the class. All Landlab components take a grid as their first argument. All subsequent keywords are parameters used to control model behavior. Each Landlab component has documentation which lists the parameters. The OverlandFlow documentation is linked in the **Model description** section above. The example script shown here includes  parameters *Manning's n*, which takes a numerical value, and the stability criterion ``steep_slopes`` flag, which is passed a Boolean (``True`` or ``False``) value. Details about the stability criterion are provided in the next subsection.

Stability criteria
..................

The OverlandFlow component is built off the de Almeida et al., (2012) algorithm for urban flood inundation, and is most stable in flat environments. Because of this, instabilities can arise when trying to apply the algorithm to steep landscapes. To adapt this model for use across a variety of terrains, stability criteria (following Coulthard et al., 2013) is implemented to using the ``steep_slopes`` flag. This method reduces flow discharge to keep flow subcritical according to the Froude number less than or equal to 1.0. For more information, see Adams et al., (in prep for *Geoscientific Model Development*).

Step 6. Precipitation inputs
````````````````````````````

Often, the user will want to route a precipitation event or a series of precipitation events across a watershed.There are two methods for setting precipitation parameters in the OverlandFlow component.

**Note**: At the moment, only uniform precipitation events have been tested using this component.

Constant precipitation input
............................

This is the simplest method, and is used when a constant precipitation intensity is routed for the entirety of a model run (model_run_time). In this example, rainfall__intensity (units [m s\ :sup:`-1`]) is passed when the OverlandFlow component is initialized (**Step 5**):

.. code-block:: python

	elapsed_time = 0.0
	model_run_time = 86400.
	of = OverlandFlow(rmg, steep_slopes=True, rainfall_intensity=1.38889 * (10**-6)) # m/s

Single storm event
..................

Alternatively, a user may decide to route an event where rainfall stops, and water drains from the system. The simplest case is a single storm event, presented here:

.. code-block:: python

	elapsed_time = 0.0
	model_run_time = 86400.

	storm_duration = 7200.0
	rainfall_mmhr = 5.

In this example, storm characteristics (duration and intensity) are set separately from the OverlandFlow component  initialization. These characteristics are used in a time loop within the model driver (seen in **Step 7**). While elapsed_time in a model is less than storm duration, the precipitation intensity is input across all nodes in the model domain. When the storm event ends, the precipitation intensity is reset to 0 [m s\ :sup:`-1`], allowing the water remaining in the system to drain out.

Step 7. Iterate through time
````````````````````````````

The key part of any Landlab model driver is the time loop, where components recalculate the processes, and update their necessary data values. In the OverlandFlow component, during a time loop, at each time step, surface water discharge and surface water depth are recalculated. A simple example of an OverlandFlow time loop is presented here:

.. code-block:: python

	while elapsed_time < model_run_time:

	of.dt = of.calc_time_step()     # Adaptive time step

	if elapsed_time < (storm_duration):
		of.rainfall_intensity =  rainfall_mmhr * (2.777778 * 10**-7)
	else:
    of.rainfall_intensity = 0.0

	of.overland_flow()

	rmg.at_node['surface_water__discharge'] = of.discharge_mapper(of.q, convert_to_volume=True)

	elapsed_time += of.dt

This code snippet is described here:

- This OverlandFlow example loops through time as a ``while`` loop. After each time loop, ``elapsed_time`` is increased until it exceeds ``model_run_time``.

- An adaptive time step is recommended, and is calculated here at the start of each time loop. (See the next subsection for more information about the adaptive time step).

- Inside the time loop, there is a test to see if the ``elapsed_time`` is less than the ``storm_duration``. If so, the rainfall intensity property of OverlandFlow is updated to the rainfall intensity (here converted from [mm hr\ :sup:`-1` to [m s\ :sup:`-1`).

- If the ``elapsed_time`` is greater than the ``storm_duration``, the rainfall intensity parameter of the OverlandFlow component is reset to 0 [m s\ :sup:`-1`].

- After the rainfall intensity is set, the actual process method ``overland_flow()`` is called. This method calculate discharge as a function of the de Almeida et al., (2012) algorithm and updates the Landlab data fields for ``surface_water__discharge`` and ``surface_water__depth`` on links and nodes respectively.

- To translate the discharge values calculated on Landlab links to nodes, values on links (``of.q``) are summed and mapped to their node neighbors using the method ``of.discharge_mapper``. Using the ``convert_to_volume`` flag, these discharge values are converted from units of [m\ :sup:`2` s\ :sup:`-1`] to [m\ :sup:`3` s\ :sup:`-1`].

- At the end of each loop, ``elapsed_time`` is updated with the adaptive time step.

**Note**: If using the adaptive time step, it may be possible that both the storm duration and model run time may be exceeded if the calculated time step is too large. It is recommended the use add additional logic tests to ensure both the storm_duration and model_run_time are not exceeded. during the time loop.

Adaptive time step
..................

de Almeida et al., (2012) implement an adaptive time step to maintain model stability and computational efficiency. This adaptive time step follows Hunter et al., (2005). By default, the OverlandFlow component calculates this adaptive time step. It is listed explicitly the **Step 7** code for clarity. If that lines was removed from that code, the component would still call ``calc_time_step()`` every time the ``overland_flow()`` method is called.

Alternatively, an explicit time step can be passed to the ``overland_flow()`` method. However, this method cannot guarantee model stability. Numerical instability in the model can drive surface water depth 'checkerboarding' patterns. Additionally, water mass imbalances can be linked to model instability. If an explicit time step must be used, a small time step is recommended to maintain model stability.

**Note**: Model behavior can vary across different parameter space and grid resolution. Stability testing is always recommended.

Plotting and visualization
--------------------------

Hydrographs
```````````

Before time loop:
.................

To plot a hydrograph, the user simply needs to save the discharge value at a given link at each time step. This can be achieved using a Python list object. Before the time loop starts, the user initializes at least two loops, one to save the model time, and one to save the discharge value.

**Note**: Currently, this plotting solution assumes the user has identified a link to sample on. In this example, the active link connecting outlet node to its neighbor core node is selected. If, in other DEMs, more than one active link is identified on the outlet node, the link with the steepest topographic slope is recommended.

.. code-block:: python

	hydrograph_time = []
	discharge_at_outlet = []

During time loop:
.................

The OverlandFlow component calculates discharge in units of [m\ :sup:`2` s\ :sup:`-1`]. In this example (and in Adams et al., *in prep. for Geoscientific Model Development*), discharge is plotted as a volumetric flux. To convert the calculated discharge (*q*) to a volumetric discharge (*Q*), it can be multiplied by the fact width, or grid resolution (*dx*) of the model grid. Similarly, time is converted from units of seconds (*s*) to hours (*hr*)

.. code-block:: python

	hydrograph_time.append(elapsed_time / 3600.) # convert seconds to hours
        discharge_at_outlet.append(np.abs(of.q[outlet_link]) * rmg.dx) # append discharge in m^3/s

After model run:
................

Once the model is done running, the hydrograph can be plotted using the matplotlib library. This is a simple example, for more customization options, we recommend the matplotlib documentation_.

.. _documentation: https://matplotlib.org//api/pyplot_api.html

.. code-block:: python

	plt.plot(hydrograph_time, discharge_at_outlet)
        plt.ylabel('Time (hr)')
        plt.xlabel('Discharge, (cms)')
        plt.title('Outlet Hydrograph, Rainfall: 5 mm/hr in 2 hr')

.. image:: images/OverlandFlow_Manual_Hydrograph.png
		:width: 300px
		:align: center

**Figure 4**: Sample hydrograph from the test basin, after a storm with intensity of 5 mm/hr for a duration of 2 hr.

Water depth maps
````````````````

The Landlab plotting library includes a utility ``imshow__grid`` which can easily take a grid instance and plot data values from the grid in map view. This method also allows for customization of the plots. An example plotting water depth is shown here:

.. code-block:: python

	imshow_grid(rmg, 'surface_water__depth', plot_name='Water depth at time = 2 hr',
                var_name='Water Depth', var_units='m', grid_units=('m', 'm'), cmap='Blues')

.. image:: images/OverlandFlow_Manual_WaterDepth.png
		:width: 300px
		:align: center

**Figure 5**: Map of water depths at time = 2 hr, for the sample storm on the square basin (5 mm/hr over duration of 2 hr).

In this example, the water depths are plotted after 2 hours of model run time
``model_run_time`` = 7200 s in **Step 6**). The method ``imshow__grid`` takes a
grid instance and data field by default. Optional methods displayed here
include plot title, color bar title (``var__name``), color bar units
(``var__units``), grid dimension units (``grid_units``), and
matplotlib color map (``cmap``).

**Note**: As of right now, ``imshow__grid`` plots data on nodes and cells.
If the user wants to plot data from link elements, a mapper from link to cell
or link to node must be used first. An extensive list of Landlab
:ref:`mapper <api.grid.base.mappers>` methods is available in the documentation.

Introduction
------------

CellLab-CTS is a Landlab module for building pairwise, continuous-time stochastic (CTS) cellular automata. Like other cellular automata, pairwise CTS models represent natural phenomena using a regular grid of cells; in the case of CellLab-CTS, the user can choose between square and hexagonal cells. Each cell has a given state, which is an integer code representing something about the nature or contents of that cell. Cells change state at random time intervals according to a user-defined transition rules. The transitions depend on the states of the neighboring cells, and in particular, of the states of each *pair* of adjacent cells. For example a pair with states 0 and 1 might undergo a transition to 1 and 1, or 3 and 0, etc.

This Users Manual provides instructions on how to write a model using CellLab-CTS, along with reference information about the classes and methods that CellLab-CTS provides. For further information about the theory, implementation, and design of CellLab-CTS, see Tucker et al. (2016). For background information on the theory of pairwise CTS models and example applications, see Narteau et al. (2001, 2009) and Rozier and Narteau (2014). For background on cellular automata in general, see Chopard and Droz (1998).

*Note on terminology:* In a CellLab-CTS model, the computational points—the objects that are normally called **cells** in a cellular automaton model—actually correspond with the **nodes** in a Landlab grid. Although Landlab grids also contain *cells*, which are defined as polygons that contain a node, Landlab grids do not have cells along the outmost ring of nodes around the grid. For example, a 4-row by 5-column Landlab raster grid has 20 nodes but only 6 cells (2 inner rows x 3 inner columns). For CellLab-CTS models, it is useful to include the perimeter nodes as "cells" for the purpose of handling boundary conditions. Therefore, CellLab-CTS treats all the **nodes** in the grid as if they were cells in a cellular automaton. This includes the perimeter nodes, for which Landlab does not formally define cells. For practical purposes, the distinction doesn't make much difference, but it is important to understand that CellLab-CTS works with arrays of grid nodes rather than the (shorter) arrays of grid cells. Henceforth, to avoid confusion, we will refer to **nodes**, which you should read as being synonymous with the usual meaning of "cell" in a cellular automaton.

*Prerequisites:* This manual assumes working knowledge of the Python programming language (any version), including basic familiarity with Python classes and objects. It also assumes a basic familiarity with Landlab grids. In addition, it will be helpful to have some familiarity with the Matplotlib and/or Pylab plotting libraries.


Writing a CellLab-CTS model
---------------------------

What is a CellLab-CTS model?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A CellLab-CTS model is a Python program that creates and initializes one of the four types of ``CellLabCTSModel`` object, defines the possible cell states and transition rules, and calls the ``run`` method to execute the model. A CellLab-CTS model can be written in one of two basic ways. The first option is to write a simple Python script that imports the necessary ingredients. This approach is easy and versatile, and is recommended for first-time users, and/or those who are relatively unfamiliar with Python classes. The second option is to write your model as a subclass of one of the four existing CellLabModel subclasses (more on these below). The subclass approach is useful when you wish to use the *dynamic property updating* capability of CellLab-CTS—that is, for example, when you want to attach some form of additional data to the grid, and update the data at each transition event according to the state of the grid. In this manual, we will focus on the example of a simple script-based model.

Basic ingredients of a CellLab-CTS model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic steps in most CellLab-CTS models are as follows:

1. Import the necessary CTS classes (and any other necessary packages). These include: one of the four CellLab-CTS model classes (described below), the ``Transition`` class, and (optionally) the ``CAPlotter`` class for graphical display.
2. Create and initialize a Landlab ``ModelGrid`` object: either a ``RasterModelGrid`` or a ``HexModelGrid``
3. Create a dictionary that defines the node states to be used
4. Create a list of Transition objects: one for each transition type in your model
5. Create an array with the initial state values in the grid
6. Instantiate and initialize one of the four CellLab-CTS classes
7. Set up plotting (if desired)
8. Run the model by calling the CellLab-CTS object's ``run`` method (perhaps pausing every so often to display the grid and/or write output to file)
9. Clean up

We will illustrate each of these steps using a simple example called ``isotropic_turbulent_suspension.py``. This program simulates the random motion of neutrally buoyant sediment particles that are immersed in a turbulent fluid: think of tea leaves in a jar of tea that you are stirring with an invisible spoon. Each random motion is simulated by simply swapping a fluid state and a particle state.

.. figure:: images/transition_example.png
    :figwidth: 80 %
    :align: center

    Figure 1: A CellLab-CTS model of suspended sediment particles in an isotropic turbulent fluid.


Before diving into the example, however, it's useful to look at the four different types of CellLab-CTS model.

Types of CellLab-CTS model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A CellLab-CTS grid can be either raster (regular grid of square cells) or hexagonal (trigonal grid of nodes with hexagonal cells). In addition, a CellLab-CTS model can be either *oriented* or *non-oriented*. An oriented model is one in which the spatial orientation of a node pair influences the types and/or of transition. For example, in an oriented raster model, a horizontal pair with states 0 and 1 might have a different set of potential transitions than a vertical pair with states 0 and 1. A non-oriented pair treats the sequence 0-1 the same regardless of whether the pair is vertical, horizontal, or (in the case of a hex grid) at any other angle.

With these different possibilities in mind, the four CellLab-CTS model types are:

1. ``RasterCTS:`` A non-oriented grid of square cells.
2. ``OrientedRasterCTS:`` An oriented grid of square cells, with two orientations (horizontal and vertical).
3. ``HexCTS``: A non-oriented grid of hexagons.
4. ``OrientedHexCTS:`` An oriented grid of hexagons, with three orientations. These can be: (1) vertical, (2) +30 degrees from horizontal (angling down/left to up/right), and (3) -30 degrees from horizontal (angling up/left to down/right). Or, alternatively, the three axes can be horizontal and +/-30 degrees from vertical (one determines this when instantiating the grid object, as illustrated below).

These four types are implemented as subclasses of the base class ``CellLabCTSModel``, as illustrated in Figure 2.

.. figure:: images/ca_class_hierarchy.png
    :align: center

    Figure 2: CellLab-CTS class hierarchy and main data structures. N = number of grid nodes, L = number of grid links, NL = number of possible link (node pair) states, NT = maximum number of transitions for any link state.


Step 1: Importing CellLab-CTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A CellLab-CTS application normally starts by importing the appropriate type of CTS model class, along with any other packages needed. Thus, our suspended-sediment model starts out as follows:

.. code-block:: python

	#!/usr/env/python

	"""
	isotropic_turbulent_suspension.py

	Example of a continuous-time, stochastic, pair-based cellular automaton model,
	which simulates the diffusion of suspended, neutrally buoyant particles in a

	Written by Greg Tucker, February 2015
	"""

	import time
	import matplotlib
	from numpy import where
	from landlab import RasterModelGrid
	from landlab.ca.celllab_cts import Transition, CAPlotter
	from landlab.ca.raster_cts import RasterCTS

Here, we're using a raster model, so we import Landlab's ``RasterModelGrid`` class. It will be a non-oriented raster model, so we import the ``RasterCTS`` class (rather than  ``OrientedRasterCTS``). We also import the ``CAPlotter`` class for help with graphical display (more on that below), as well as the ``Transition`` class. We need the Transition class to set up our pair transitions, which we explore next.


Setting up transitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sequence matters!
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

A particular pair state is described by the two node states, and optionally by the pair's orientation. A key thing to understand here is that any particular pair sequence, such as 0 and 1, is *different from the sequence in reverse*. The pair 0-1 is not the same as the pair 1-0! This is true for all four types of model. So then which is which? To answer this question, we first need to recall that each pair corresponds to the two ends of a *link* in the Landlab grid. A link is simply a directed line segment that connects two neighboring nodes. Every link has a *tail* and a *head* (like the head of an arrow); the direction of the link is from tail to head. The rule for CellLab-CTS pairs is that the first number refers to the tail of the corresponding link, and the second refers to its head. Thus, the pair state 0-1 means that the tail node has state 0 and the head node has state 1.

By default, the links in a raster grid always run from down to up (for vertical links) or left to right (for horizontal links) (Figure 3). For example, with a 0-1 pair in a raster grid, the 0 is either the left-hand node (if it's a horizontal pair) or the bottom node (if the pair is vertical). In a default hex grid, the links point either (1) upward, (2) angling right and up 30 degrees, or (3) angling right and down 30 degrees. (Note that you also have the option of switching the grid orientation so that one of the principal axes is horizontal instead of vertical; in that case, the three orientations are horizontal, 30 degrees clockwise from vertical, and 30 degrees counter-clockwise from vertical).

Each transition type is described by the states of the tail and head nodes, and by the orientation of the pair. This information is encoded in a 3-element tuple. Recall that each pair is associated with a link. The first number is the state of the link's tail node, the second is the state of the link's head node, and the third is an *orientation code* that represents the pair's spatial orientation (Figure 4). In a non-oriented model, the orientation code is always zero. In an oriented raster, the orientation code is either 0 (horizontal) or 1 (vertical). For example, the code (0, 1, 0) in an oriented raster model would represent a vertical pair in which the left node has state 0 and the right state 1.

.. figure:: images/cell_pair_orientation.png
    :align: center

    Figure 4: Pair orientation codes in a raster (top 2 panels) and vertical hex (bottom 3 panels) grid.

In an oriented hex, the orientation codes depend on the orientation of the grid itself. A Landlab ``HexModelGrid`` can be oriented such that one of the three principal axes is either horizontal (the default) or vertical. The choice is controlled by the optional keyword argument ``orientation`` (either ``'vertical'`` or ``'horizontal'``) in the ``HexModelGrid`` initialization function. For a vertically aligned hex grid, the CellLab-CTS orientation codes are: 0 for vertical, 1 for right and upward, and 2 for right and downward (Figure 4). For example, the code (1, 0, 2) would represent a down-and-right pair, with a state of 1 in the upper-left node and 0 in the lower-right node. For a horizontally aligned hex grid, the CellLab-CTS orientation codes are: 0 for upward and left, 1 for upward and right, and 2 for right. For example, the code (1, 0, 2) would represent a left-to-right pair, with a state of 1 in the left node and 0 in the right node.

Example of a transition setup function
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

It can be helpful to put the transition setup procedure inside a function of its own. Here is the transition setup function for our turbulent suspension example (notice that the function itself has only four lines of code; all the rest is documentation):

.. code-block:: python

	def setup_transition_list():
		"""
		Creates and returns a list of Transition() objects to represent state
		transitions for an unbiased random walk.

		Parameters
		----------
		(none)

		Returns
		-------
		xn_list : list of Transition objects
			List of objects that encode information about the link-state transitions.

		Notes
		-----
		State 0 represents fluid and state 1 represents a particle (such as a
		sediment grain, tea leaf, or solute molecule).

		The states and transitions are as follows:

		Pair state      Transition to       Process             Rate (cells/s)
		==========      =============       =======             ==============
		0 (0-0)         (none)              -                   -
		1 (0-1)         2 (1-0)             left/down motion    10.0
		2 (1-0)         1 (0-1)             right/up motion     10.0
		3 (1-1)         (none)              -                   -

		"""

		# Create an empty transition list
		xn_list = []

		# Append two transitions to the list.
		# Note that the arguments to the Transition() object constructor are:
		#  - Tuple representing starting pair state
		#    (left/bottom cell, right/top cell, orientation)
		#  - Tuple representing new pair state
		#    (left/bottom cell, right/top cell, orientation)
		#  - Transition rate (cells per time step, in this case 1 sec)
		#  - Name for transition
		xn_list.append( Transition((0,1,0), (1,0,0), 10., 'left/down motion') )
		xn_list.append( Transition((1,0,0), (0,1,0), 10., 'right/up motion') )

		return xn_list


In this example, state 0 represents the fluid and state 1 represents a particle. Motion is represented by a transition from a 0-1 pair to a 1-0, or vice versa.

Your transition setup function should create and return a list of ``Transition`` objects. A Transition object contains (and is initialized with) the 3-element tuples for the starting and ending transitions, a transition rate (in units of cell-widths per time), and (optionally) a name. Two other optional parameters are used when you want to track properties associated with moving particles: a boolean flag (``swap_properties``) indicating whether the transition involves an exchange of properties, and the name of a user-defined callback function (``prop_update_fn``) to invoke whenever a transition of that type occurs.

(Note that it is also possible to specify a single-integer code for the link state, instead of 3-element tuple. This is a bit more of a headache, however, since it requires you to work out the link-state code corresponding to each pair, and is not recommended.)

Defining parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Typical parameters in a CellLab-CTS model, in addition to the transitions and rates, include the dimensions of the grid, the duration of the run, and the time intervals for plotting, writing output to file, and/or reporting progress on screen. In the following example, we have defined these within a ``main()`` function. They could also be read in from a file, input on a command line, or specified by some other method.

.. code-block:: python

	def main():

		# INITIALIZE

		# User-defined parameters
		nr = 80  # number of rows in grid
		nc = 50  # number of columns in grid
		plot_interval = 0.5   # time interval for plotting, sec
		run_duration = 20.0   # duration of run, sec
		report_interval = 10.0  # report interval, in real-time seconds

		# Remember the clock time, and calculate when we next want to report
		# progress.
		current_real_time = time.time()
		next_report = current_real_time + report_interval

Step 2: Creating a grid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on the type of CTS model to be used, your code will need to instantiate either a ``RasterModelGrid`` or a ``HexModelGrid``. If you wish to modify the default boundary setup, this should be done right after the grid is created. In the example below, we create a raster grid and set each of its four boundaries to act like a wall:

.. code-block:: python

    # Create grid
    mg = RasterModelGrid(nr, nc, 1.0)

    # Make the boundaries be walls
    mg.set_closed_boundaries_at_grid_edges(True, True, True, True)

Step 3: Create a node-state dictionary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The possible node states are defined by creating entries in a dictionary, in which each key is an integer and each value is a string that gives the name for that state. There should be one entry for each state in your model. For example, our isotropic turbulent suspension model defines just two states:

.. code-block:: python

    ns_dict = { 0 : 'fluid', 1 : 'particle' }

Step 4: Create the transition list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you've already defined a transition setup function, all you need to do here is call that function, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

    xn_list = setup_transition_list()

Step 5: Create an array containing the initial node-state values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The node state array should be a 1D numpy array of integers, with length equal to the number of grid rows times the number of grid columns. The easiest way to create such a grid is to use the grid's ``add_zeros()`` method (or, similarly, ``add_ones`` or ``add_empty``). For example, for the suspended-sediment example we'll create an array of zeros, representing a container filled with fluid:

.. code-block:: python

    # Create the node-state array and attach it to the grid
    node_state_grid = mg.add_zeros('node', 'node_state_map', dtype=int)

The first argument here is the name of the grid element to which values should be attached, the second is a name to give the array, and the third sets the data type to integer (instead of the default ``float`` type).

Depending on the nature of the model, the next step is to set the initial values of the node states. You can do this just as you would with any Landlab grid field. Remember that the coordinates of each node in a Landlab grid are available through the ``node_x`` and ``node_y`` arrays. For our working example, we'll set the lower 10% of nodes to state 1, indicating that we are starting with a pile of tea leaves at the bottom of the container:

.. code-block:: python

    # Initialize the node-state array: here, the initial condition is a pile of
    # resting grains at the bottom of a container.
    bottom_rows = where(mg.node_y<0.1*nr)[0]
    node_state_grid[bottom_rows] = 1

    # For visual display purposes, set all boundary nodes to fluid
    node_state_grid[mg.closed_boundary_nodes] = 0

Note the use of the numpy ``where`` function, which we imported in Step 1.

Step 6: Instantiate a CellLab-CTS object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our core model will be an object (a.k.a. *instance*) of one of the four CellLabCTS model classes. We create this just as we would any other Python object: by calling its constructor function, which is simply the name of the class followed by parentheses, with any necessary arguments within the parentheses. There are four required arguments: a grid object (which must be of the correct type, i.e., raster or hex), a dictionary of node states, a list of ``Transition`` objects, and the initial node state array. Here's what it looks like for our raster-based suspension model:

.. code-block:: python

    # Create the CA model
    ca = RasterCTS(mg, ns_dict, xn_list, node_state_grid)

Step 7: Set up plotting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to display your model's progress on screen, you can pause the run every once in a while and use pylab, matplotlib, or whatever your favorite graphics library may be to plot what's going on. For convenience, CellLab-CTS provides a ``CAPlotter`` class. CAPlotter is smart enough to find your node-state array, and to plot its contents in raster or hex form as appropriate. When you create the CAPlotter object, you pass it your CA model object and optionally a matplotlib colormap object. The CAPlotter has an ``update_plot`` method to plot the current state of your model, and a ``finalize`` method to clean up.

Here's an example of how to use a CAPlotter:

.. code-block:: python

    # Set up colors for plotting
    grain = '#5F594D'
    fluid = '#D0E4F2'
    clist = [fluid,grain]
    my_cmap = matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap(clist)

    # Create a CAPlotter object for handling screen display
    ca_plotter = CAPlotter(ca, cmap=my_cmap)

    # Plot the initial grid
    ca_plotter.update_plot()

Step 8: Run the model
---------------------

Once a CTS model object has been instantiated, you run it forward in time with the ``run`` method. ``run`` takes one required argument: the future time to which to run. There are also three optional arguments:

* a node-state array (this is provided so that if you wish you can modify the array and re-run)
* a flag indicating whether to re-plot after each transition occurs
* a plotter object, which is required if the value of the flag is True

If you wish to pause occasionally to plot and/or write data to file, a natural approach is to place the call to the run method inside a loop, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

    # RUN
    current_time = 0.0
    while current_time < run_duration:

        # Once in a while, print out simulation real time to let the user
        # know that the sim is running ok
        current_real_time = time.time()
        if current_real_time >= next_report:
            print('Current simulation time '+str(current_time)+'  \
            	   ('+str(int(100*current_time/run_duration))+'%)')
            next_report = current_real_time + report_interval

        # Run the model forward in time until the next output step
        ca.run(current_time+plot_interval, ca.node_state,
               plot_each_transition=False)
        current_time += plot_interval

        # Plot the current grid
        ca_plotter.update_plot()

Step 9: Cleanup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There generally isn't much to clean up. If you are using a CAPlotter object, it can be helpful to call its ``finalize`` method, which turns off matplotlib's interactive mode and calls ``show()`` to make sure the plot is displayed on screen.

.. code-block:: python

    ca_plotter.finalize()

Main data structures in the CellLabCTSModel class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each of the four types of CTS model inherits from the base class (CellLabCTSModel) the following data structures. These are also illustrated in Figure 2. (Note: some of the data structures and names have changed since the publication of Tucker et al. (2016); thus, the list below differs in some respects from the original paper and from Figure 2.)

``node_state`` : 1d array (x number of nodes in grid)
	Node-based grid of node-state codes. This is the grid of cell (sic) states.

``node_pair`` : list (x number of possible link states)
    List of 3-element tuples representing all the various link states. Allows
    you to look up the node states and orientation corresponding to a particular
    link-state ID.

``priority_queue`` : object
    Data structure that implements a priority queue. The queue contains all
    future transition events, sorted by time of occurrence (from soonest to latest).

``next_update`` : 1d array (x number of active links)
    Time (in the future) at which the link will undergo its next transition.
    You might notice that the update time for every scheduled transition is also
    stored in each Event object in the event queue. Why store it twice? Because
    a scheduled event might be invalidated after the event has been scheduled
    (because another transition has changed one of a link's two nodes, for
    example). The way to tell whether a scheduled event is still valid is to
    compare its time with the corresponding transition time in the *next_update*
    array. If they are different, the event is discarded.

``link_orientation`` : 1d array of ints (x number of active links)
    Orientation code for each link.

``link_state`` : 1d array of ints (x number of active links)
    State code for each link.

``n_trn`` : 1d array of ints (x number of possible link states)
    Number of transitions ("xn" stands for "transition") from a given link
    state.

``trn_to`` : 1d array of np.int (x number of transitions)
    Stores the link-state code(s) to which a particular link state can
    transition.

``trn_rate`` : 1d array of floats (x number of transitions)
    Rate associated with each link-state transition.

Introduction to Python
======================

Why Python?
-----------

Landlab is coded in Python and includes as dependencies a number
of widely used scientific Python packages—in particular, NumPy and SciPy. The
decision to code in Python was explicitly made to lower the bar to entry for
Landlab; to increase the flexibility and reusability of the code base; and to
increase development speed both for the core development team and for future
users. The choice of Python also means that developers using Landlab can take
advantage of that language's affinity for rapid development timescales.

Other advantages of this choice include high portability between platforms,
open source language, numerous existing scientific libraries that prevent
developers having to "reinvent the wheel," and support for selective
optimization of time-critical parts of the code base in Cython
(see :ref:`Cython <cython>`).

Getting to know Python
----------------------

We recommend you approach Landlab with a basic working knowledge of the Python
coding language. A good, concise, complete beginner's guide that will get you
to enough knowledge to be able to get started can be found
`at interactivepython <https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/GeneralIntro/ThePythonProgrammingLanguage.html>`_.
We like `the Software Carpentry intro <https://v4.software-carpentry.org/python/index.html>`_
and
`these Python notebooks <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/tree/master/>`_
as more comprehensive introductions to Python.

Landlab is also written in an object-oriented coding style. Many of the
elements of Landlab that you will interact with—grids, components,
utilities—are Python objects, which means they contain both data that describe
the object and functions that you can call that operate on the object. Think
of the object as a container in which everything relevant to that part of the
code is stored, so that it can be accessed easily. You can read a bit more
about Python objects `on this page <https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex40.html>`_
for general information. There is more detail on what this means in terms of
running our code on the :ref:`Build a Model page <build_a_model>`.

If you know MatLab…
```````````````````

If you're already familiar with Matlab, you will probably feel at home with
Python fairly quickly. However, there are some critical differences. Important
things to remember include:

Python's indexing is inclusive at the start and exclusive at the end (in
contrast to Matlab). For example, in Python

.. code-block:: python

    numpy.arange(0, 100)

will give an array of 100 numbers, starting at 0 and ending at 99.

Python doesn't use parentheses or brackets to delimit code blocks (functions,
loops, if statements, etc.). Instead it uses a colon to declare the start of a
code block, then consistent indenting (normally 4 spaces) to for the rest of
the block. e.g.,

.. code-block:: python

    def myfunction(input_param):
        if type(input_param) is str:
            print("The input to the function said: ", input_param)
        else:
            print("The input parameter wasn't a string.")
            print("It was actually " + str(type(input_param)))

Lines don't need to end with the semicolon to suppress output; Python won't
print output unless you explicitly call ``print``.

Finally, but importantly, Python doesn't use the hat ``^`` as its
raise-to-the-power symbol. Instead, it uses a double star ``**``. Simple, but
typically very frustrating for a day or two during transition! There's also the
NumPy method, ``np.square``, which if you're using arrays typically outperforms
the ``**`` operator.

We have a very short tutorial on Python and NumPy from the point of view of
Landlab (and the key differences with Matlab)
`here <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=notebooks/tutorials/python_intro/python_intro.ipynb>`_.

NumPy, SciPy, and Efficient Coding Style
----------------------------------------

NumPy and SciPy are the workhorse scientific computing packages of Python.
They provide fast, efficient, and surprisingly comprehensive data structures
and numerical methods that we (and you) can exploit to make coding in Landlab
faster and easier.

In particular, Landlab makes extensive use of the NumPy array data structure.
Almost all data input and output from Landlab is in the form of an array (see
:ref:`Landlab Fields <fields>` for more information).
These arrays allow operations to happen much faster on the data than would be
possible in a pure Python data structure like a list or a dictionary. (This is
possible because NumPy arrays suppress some of Python's inbuilt type checking
and memory management and impose a more ordered structure on the way raw data
is held in your computer's memory).

In order to exploit the speed gains that NumPy can give you, you'll need to
adopt a coding style quite different to what would be natural in, say, C++ (or
likely, Matlab). A typical bottleneck in Python code occurs when looping over
data, and NumPy arrays let you avoid doing this. So if you find yourself about
to write something like:

.. code-block:: python

    for i in range(len(myarray)):
        myoutputarray[i] = myoutputarray[i] + myarray[i]

Don't! Try instead to develop a coding style where each line operates on the
 whole array at once. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    myoutputarray += myarray

In particular, it can be very tempting to use loops to apply a condition over a
whole array. Try not to do this! Instead of

.. code-block:: python

    for i in myarray:
        if i < 0:
          i = 0

which will be really slow. Do this:

.. code-block:: python

    myarray[myarray < 0] = 0

There is much more information about writing efficient NumPy code online.

We also strongly recommend the book "High Performance Python" by Gorelick and
Ozsvald, published by O'Reilly, if you're looking for a more comprehensive
treatment.

.. _cython:

Cython
------

If you explore the Landlab source code, you will discover that not all of
Landlab is written in pure Python. Some of it is written in Cython. Cython is a
programming language closely related to Python, and indeed, all code written in
pure Python is automatically also Cython code. Cython is probably best thought
of as a cross between C++ and Python, which aims to combine the flexibility of
Python with the brute power and granular control that C++ provides. For
example, if there are sections of code where looping through an array is
unavoidable, Cython provides a way to significantly accelerate the speed of
this code. Cython code largely looks like straightforward Python, but may have
type declarations or other C++-like features.

From the user's perspective, the most important thing to note is that Cython is
a compiled language. (This isn't true of Python, which is an
interpreted—compiled at run time—language.) We provide the pre-compiled
executables you will need to run Landlab when you install, and this should be
sufficient for the vast majority of users.

However if, as a developer, you intend to modify any of the sections of code
that we provide to you, you will probably need to recompile that code on your
machine before the changes take effect. See the
:ref:`developer installation instructions <developer_install>`
for more information on this.
.. _zero_to_one:

Transition from Landlab 0.x to 1.0
==================================

Landlab 1.0beta was introduced May 12, 2016. This new version—the first
official stable release—introduces some powerful new capabilities. It
also brings some standardization, which means changes to certain
function names and ways of doing things. In order to minimize the impact
of these changes on your work, we've provided here a simple guide to
some of the major changes.

Quick summary
-------------

how to make your Landlab programs work with version 1.0beta

Grid element and attribute names
````````````````````````````````

Old: ``link_length``
New: ``length_of_link``

Old: ``node_x``, ``node_y``
New: ``x_of_node``, ``y_of_node`` OR ``node_x``, ``node_y``

(NOTE: ``node_x`` and ``node_y`` are still supported, but best practice
is now to use ``x_of_node`` and ``y_of_node``)

Old:``cell_area``
New:``area_of_cell``

Old: ``face_width``
New: ``width_of_face``

Common grid functions
`````````````````````

Old: ``calculate_gradients_at_active_links``,
``calculate_gradients_at_links``

New: ``calc_grad_at_link`` (input is node-based array or field name;
output is a link-based array [**not** just active links])

Old: ``calculate_flux_divergence_at_nodes``

New: ``calc_flux_div_at_node`` (input is a *link-based array* [**not**
just active links])

New standardized function usage and syntax
------------------------------------------

Syntax of grid properties and functions
---------------------------------------

Data associated with Landlab grids include:

-  arrays that contain information about connections among grid elements

-  arrays that contain numerical attributes

-  grid functions

Arrays that contain information about how various grid elements now use
a naming scheme that looks like this:

``<element(s)>_at_<element>``

Examples: ``link_at_face``, ``node_at_cell``, ``node_at_link_tail``,
``links_at_node``, ``faces_at_cell``

The word before ``_at_`` indicates what is being returned: the IDs of
links, or nodes, or faces, etc. A plural word before ``_at_``, such as
``links_at_node``, indicates that there are multiple values for each
element. For example, there are multiple links connected to every grid
node (in a raster grid, most nodes have four links).

The word(s) after ``_at_`` indicate the dimension of the array returned.
For example, ``grid.link_at_face`` contains an array of the IDs of a
link associated with a face. The array length is equal to the number of
faces. Element 0 contains the ID of the link that crosses face 0, and so
on.

In general, arrays containing a numerical attribute associated with
elements, such as the length of links, are named with the pattern:

``<attribute>_of_<element>``

Examples: ``length_of_link``, ``width_of_face``, ``area_of_cell``

Grid functions that return arrays of information have names that hint at
the complexity of the underlying computation. In general, names that
simply describe a property or attribute, such as ``length_of_link``,
have minimum computational cost. Often they either simply provide an
existing array, or compute the values once but retain them thereafter so
that no further cost is incurred on future calls (though creating the
array may have an extra memory cost). More computationally expensive
functions, such that require one or more multiple floating-point
operations at each grid element, have the prefix ``calc_``. For example,
``calc_grad_at_link`` performs a subtraction and division operation at
each grid link.

Gradient and flux divergence functions
--------------------------------------

New functionality in Landlab's built-in gradient and flux-divergence
methods include:

1 - The primary gradient-calculation function (for scalar quantities
defined on nodes) is now ``calc_grad_at_link``. This replaces the
previous functions ``calculate_gradients_at_active_links`` and
``calculates_gradients_at_links``.

2 - ``calc_grad_at_link`` returns gradient values at **all** links, not
just active links. In general, Landlab's grid functions now only operate
with "complete" sets of grid elements. They will neither accept nor
return partial sets of a given element type (such as active or inactive
links, core or boundary nodes, etc.).

3 - The primary divergence operation function is now
``calc_flux_div_at_node``. This replaces
``calculate_flux_divergence_at_nodes``. Note that it accepts an array
(or grid field name) with flux values defined on **all links** (not just
active links). Alternatively, if you provide an array (or grid field
name) with a length equal to the number of cell faces, it assumes that
these represent flux vectors aligned with the links that cross the
faces.

4 - In general, previous function names that began with ``calculate_``
have been shortened to ``calc_``. Similarly, names involving
``_gradient_`` are shortened to ``_grad_``, and those involving
``_divergence_`` are shortened to ``_div_``.

3 - Names are singular. For example, ``calc_grad_at_link`` replaces
``calculate_gradients_at_links``, even though the function returns a
value for *every* link.

4 - Landlab now provides a *net flux* function:
``calc_net_flux_at_node`` adds up fluxes around the perimeter of each
cell, essentially performing a numerical line integral. Values at
perimeter nodes (which do not have corresponding cells) are either set
to zero, or (if the user passes in an array to hold the result) are left
unchanged. The function ``calc_net_flux_at_node`` is identical to
\`calc_flux_div_at_node except that the net flux is not divided by cell
area.

5 - Stay tuned for equivalent functions that calculates the gradient
along **faces**, and net flux and flux divergence within **patches**
(with the resulting values tied to **corners**). These will appear in a
future version, and will be named: ``calc_grad_at_face``,
``calc_net_flux_at_corner``, and ``calc_flux_div_at_corner``.

For more information and examples about the new **grad** and **div**
functions, see the entries in the Reference manual for gradient
functions and divergence functions.

Changes in Component Usage
--------------------------

Components are now standardised across Landlab, eliminating the numerous
inconsistencies that existed before. This standardisation is as follows:

1 - All component classes can now be imported directly from
``landlab.components``, e.g.:

``from landlab.components import FlowRouter``

2 - All components are now instantiated using the same signature. The
first argument is the ModelGrid. Subsequent arguments are the keywords
to provide the input parameters needed by the component, and any other
flags.

Components no longer take an input file, per se. Rather, in keeping with
the spirit of numpy, the necessary input parameters are passed as
keywords. This has several advantages, including allowing explicit
default values to be present, and clear to the user, and also allowing
dynamic Python objects (e.g., an existing array of values) to be passed
in as arguments. Note however that it is still possible (and indeed
encouraged) to use an input file, but now you will need to turn it into
a python dictionary before passing it to the component (see below). The
recommended way to do this is with the ``load_params`` function, which
performs typing of arguments automatically and can read a variety of
file types. However, the older ways of using the Landlab
``ModelParameterDictionary`` will also still work (though are
deprecated).

This construction format will be listed explicitly in the documentation.
Try ``help(MyComponent)`` in an interactive session to see it, or look
it up online.

For the moment, many components are back compatible with the old ways of
doing things, but this is deprecated functionality and no longer
documented. It may disappear entirely in future releases.

All this means that all of the following are possible ways to
instantiate a component:

::

   >>> from landlab.components import FastscapeEroder
   >>> from landlab import RasterModelGrid, load_params, ModelParameterDictionary
   >>> mg = RasterModelGrid((4, 5), 1.)
   >>> sp1 = FastscapeEroder(mg, K_sp=1.e-6)  # the minimum information needed, passed by hand, OR
   >>> sp2 = FastscapeEroder(mg, K_sp=np.random.rand(20.), m_sp=0.5, n_sp=1.,
   ...                       threshold_sp=0., rainfall_intensity=1.)  # note the array, OR
   >>> myparamdict1 = load_params('my_input_file.txt')
   >>> sp3 = FastscapeEroder(mg, **myparamdict1)  # note the "**". Necessary args come from the dict, OR
   >>> myparamdict2 = ModelParameterDictionary('my_input_file.txt', auto_type=True)
   >>> sp4 = FastscapeEroder(mg, **myparamdict2)  # ...but it's best practice to use load_params instead
   >>> sp5 = FastscapeEroder(mg, 'my_input_file.txt')  # still works in many cases, but DEPRECATED

3 - All components now have a "run method" with the standardised name
``run_one_step``. The first argument is always the timestep, dt, if
needed by the component. Subsequent arguments may be present as flags to
control run behaviour. As an example:

::

   >>> sp = FastscapeEroder(mg, K_sp=1.e-6)
   >>> dt = 1000.
   >>> for i in range(100):  # 100 ka of erosion
   ...     sp.run_one_step(dt)

The old run methods still exist inside many components, but we encourage
migration to this new standardised format.

4 - ``run_one_step()`` never returns anything. There is no need; the
grid object will already have been updated as necessary.

5 - All components should now have comprehensive and up-to-date
documentation. View it on the website, or in an interactive python
session use either ``help(MyComponent)`` or ``MyComponent?``.

Standardisation of Component Standard Field Names
-------------------------------------------------

In the interests of internal self consistency and repeatability, the
currently in-use component standard field names have been overhauled.
This is likely to break quite a bit of code, but a search-and-replace
will fix things very fast.

The following represents a (hopefully) almost complete list of the name
substitutions:

-  'channel_bed_shear_stress' → 'channel__bed_shear_stress'
-  'channel_depth' → 'channel__depth'
-  'channel_discharge' → 'channel__discharge'
-  'channel_width' → 'channel__width'
-  'drainage_area' –> We're keeping it BOOM
-  'effective_fluvial_diffusivity' → field removed
-  'elevation' –> 'topographic__elevation'
-  'flow_receiver' –> 'flow__receiver_node'
-  'flow_sinks' –> 'flow__sink_flag'
-  'fluvial_sediment_flux_into_node' →
   'channel_sediment__volumetric_flux'
-  'Fluvial_sediment_transport_capacity' →
   'channel_sediment__volumetric_transport_capacity'
-  'Links_to_flow_receiver' →flow__link_to_receiver_node'
-  'lithosphere__elevation' –> 'lithosphere_surface__elevation'
-  'lithosphere__elevation_increment' →
   'lithosphere_surface__elevation_increment'
-  'planet_surface_sediment__deposition_increment' –>
   'sediment__deposition_increment'
-  'potentiality_field' –> 'flow__potential'
-  'relative_sediment_flux' → 'channel_sediment__relative_flux'
-  'shear_stress' –> 'channel__bed_shear_stress'
-  'slope_at_nodes' –> 'topographic__steepest_slope' (slope === downhill
   gradient)
-  'stream_power_erosion' → field removed
-  'surface_gradient' –> 'topographic__slope'
-  'upstream_ID_order' –> 'flow__upstream_node_order'
-  'Upstream_node_order' –> 'flow__upstream_node_order'
-  'water__volume_flux' → 'water__discharge'
-  'water__volume_flux_in' → 'water__unit_flux_in' (special case in flow
   router)
-  'water__volume_flux_magnitude', → 'water__discharge'
-  'water__volume_flux_xcomponent', → 'water__discharge_x_component'
-  'water__volume_flux_ycomponent', → 'water__discharge_y_component'
-  'water_depth' –> 'water__depth'
-  'water_discharge' –> 'water__discharge'
-  'water_discharge_at_nodes' –> 'water__discharge'
-  'water_surface_slope_at_nodes' –> 'water_surface__gradient'

These changes are likely to occur in components probably not released as
part of LL1.0, but will have likely occurred once the components return
in a future release:

-  'ActualEvapotranspiration' –> surface__evapotranspiration_rate
-  'CumulativeWaterStress' –> vegetation__cumulative_water_stress
-  'DeadBiomass' –> vegetation__dead_biomass
-  'DeadLeafAreaIndex –> vegetation__dead_leaf_area_index
-  'Drainage' –> duplicate of 'drainage_area' ?
-  'Elevation' –> duplicate of topographic__elevation, or needs to be
   more specific
-  'LiveBiomass' –> vegetation__live_biomass
-  'LiveLeafAreaIndex' –> vegetation__live_leaf_area_index
-  'NetLongWaveRadiation' –> radiation__net_longwave
-  'NetRadiation' –> radiation__net
-  'NetShortWaveRadiation' –> radiation__net_shortwave
-  'PlantAge' –> plant__age
-  'PlantLiveIndex' –> plant__live_index
-  'PotentialEvapotranspiration' –>
   surface__potential_evapotranspiration_rate
-  'RadiationFactor' –> radiation__ratio_to_flat_surface
-  'Runoff' –> I think I'm OK with runoff__rate
-  'SaturationFraction' –> soil_moisture__saturation_fraction
-  'TotalShortWaveRadiation' –> radiation__incoming_shortwave
-  'VegetationCover', –> vegetation__cover_fraction
-  'VegetationType' –> vegetation__type
-  'WaterStress' –> soil_moisture__water_stress

Tutorials
=========

The Landlab Tutorials provide examples of Landlab core concepts and component
introductions. Tutorials exist as interactive Jupyter notebooks that contain
alternating cells of computer code and text that explain the code. In addition
to Landlab Tutorials that exemplify Landlab, notebooks intended to teach and
learn surface dynamics are the
:ref:`Landlab Teaching Tutorials <teaching_tutorials>`.

Launch notebooks online
-----------------------

Landlab Notebooks can be accessed online with the following link:
`Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=notebooks/welcome.ipynb>`_.
Here the notebooks are provided within a binder online environment that
includes Landlab.

The welcome page on Binder provides onward links to most of our tutorials.
If you're a newbie you might want to skip directly to a recommended syllabus
for learning Landlab
`here <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=notebooks/tutorials/syllabus.ipynb>`_.

Launch notebooks locally
------------------------

How you installed Landlab determines the steps to launch notebooks that use a
copy of Landlab on your computer.

User installations
``````````````````

If you installed using a prepackaged binary, the most common method, the
notebooks can be run in a conda environment.
:ref:`These instructions <conda_environment>` describe how to create a conda
environment for the notebooks.

Once the conda environment has been created, it must be activated and then the
notebooks can be launched:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda activate landlab_notebooks
   $ jupyter notebook notebooks/welcome.ipynb

Developer installations
```````````````````````

If you installed using the
:ref:`developer install instructions <developer_install>`, the tutorials exist
on your computer within the ``notebooks`` folder of your local Landlab clone.

If you installed Landlab within an environment, the environment must be
activated and then the notebooks can be launched. The following code assumes
that the environment name is `landlab_dev`:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda activate landlab_dev
   $ jupyter notebook notebooks/welcome.ipynb

Contributing new or modified tutorials
--------------------------------------

If you write a Landlab Tutorial or Gist, please contribute it via a pull request
to the master branch of the Landlab repository. See this
:ref:`page <ongoing_development>` about contributing to Landlab, and
:ref:`reach out for help <contact>` when needed.

Landlab clinics and workshops
-----------------------------

For more examples and tutorials, see also our :ref:`Clinics & workshops
page <clinics_workshops>`.
.. _build_a_model:

===============================
What goes into a Landlab model?
===============================

In the previous section, :ref:`Grid <grid_user_guide>` we showed you most of the core
functionality of the Landlab grid. In this section, we introduce you to how to
actually use it to build models and work with the Landlab component library.

Using Landlab requires that you build a Python script to import, instantiate,
and then run your landscape model. We describe such a script as a **driver**.
It's also possible to do the same set of processes on the fly in an interactive
Python environment like iPython.

Typically, a driver file will consist of six distinct sections:

* **Import** the Python and Landlab libraries you'll need to run your model
* **Instantiate** the Landlab elements (grid and, if using them, components)
* **Load** any necessary data into the grid fields
* Set the **boundary conditions**
* **Run** the model, typically by creating a for loop or using a Landlab generator (see below)
* **Finalize** and handle the data (e.g., plot, export)

Beyond the driver, if you're using Landlab components, you'll probably also need
a :ref:`parameter file<input_files>`. This file supplies the components with the additional
parameter and setup information they need. Landlab parameter files are text
files ``.txt``, have fixed format, and for convenience (so you only have to
specify the minimum of path information in the file name) should be placed in
the same folder as the driver file. Find out more about parameter files
:ref:`here<input_files>`. However, if you're not using components, there's little need
to create a parameter file; you can just directly pass other parameters to the grid
in the driver.

A brief introduction to components
----------------------------------

A key strength of Landlab is that not only is it designed to make implementing
your own process simulations as simple as possible, but it also offers an
off-the-shelf library of pre-designed process descriptions that you can use in
your drivers. We call these process simulators Landlab **components**. The
intention is that each component be:

* Plug-and-play
* Interoperable with all other components
* Implementable in your driver in only one or two lines of code

By no means is using the component library necessary or even always
desirable when working with Landlab. However, we hope that components will dramatically reduce the time investment needed to implement
a wide variety of modeling scenarios. In particular, components should make
producing models that couple more than one process significantly easier because
existing, off-the-shelf components can be slotted in alongside novel process
descriptions.

A list of the current components is found within the Reference guide
:ref:`components section <api.components>`.

Note that not all components will run under all conditions, but any
limitations should be made clear in the documentation associated with
that component.

In particular, some components may demand you are running on a regular grid. It
should probably also be emphasized that most of these components are still under
active development within this beta release of Landlab, and may behave in
idiosyncratic ways or be subject to sudden changes with little or no warning. In
all cases, before setting out on any major research challenges using a
component, we'd recommend contacting the original coder of the component to let
them know they have external users to think about!

Implementing a Landlab driver
-----------------------------

As noted above, the process of creating a driver is essentially equivalent
whether you want to implement Landlab components, purely use your own code, or
combine some mixture of the two. Here we take a closer look at the various
steps.

1. Import the libraries and functions you need
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Landlab handles a lot like NumPy, and like NumPy you'll need to import the
various libraries and functions that you'll want to use. At the very least, we
suspect you'll need from outside Landlab:

* *NumPy* itself
* rudimentary Pylab plotting routines: *plot*, *show*, *figure*

Also useful can be:

* the Python module *time*, to time various parts of your code elements
* from *SciPy*, the scientific computing library. Lots of useful methods (e.g.,
  matrix solutions, curve fitting) can be found in here, to avoid reinventing
  the wheel.

From inside Landlab, you'll also need:

* A **grid** class—choose from :py:class:`RasterModelGrid <landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid>`,
  :py:class:`landlab.grid.voronoi.VoronoiDelaunayGrid <landlab.grid.voronoi.VoronoiDelaunayGrid>`,
  or some of the more specialized classes listed on the
  :ref:`grid documentation page <api.grid>`.
* Any **components** you want to run
* Any Landlab **utilities** you need, such as plotters (
  :py:func:`imshow_grid <landlab.plot.imshow>`) or
  :ref:`io functions <api.io>`.

A specific example might be:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from pylab import show, figure, plot
    import time
    from landlab import RasterModelGrid
    from landlab.components import FlowAccumlator
    from landlab.plot.imshow import imshow_node_grid

2. Instantiate objects
++++++++++++++++++++++

As noted in previous sections, Landlab is coded in an `object-oriented style
<https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/python-from-scratch-object-oriented-programming--net-21476>`_.
This means that we need to "instantiate" the various Landlab objects such as
the grid and the components that we will use to store data and run the model.

Note that most components require the grid object be passed to them as one of
their arguments during instantiation, so the first thing you'll want to
instantiate will be the grid.

Check the docstrings for each class (grid, component) you want to instantiate
for a detailed description of what you need to supply as arguments.

For a RasterModelGrid, this will be ``((i, j), [node_spacing])``. Here, ``(i, j)`` is a tuple where *i* is the number of rows and *j* the number of columns, and ``node_spacing`` is an optional second tuple or float. If you want uniform node spacing in the *y* and *x* directions, use a float, otherwise use a tuple to specify ``(dy, dx)`` if you want them to be different (see example immediately below). Spacing will default to (1., 1.). [Landlab also recognizes an older style of RasterModelGrid signature, which looks like ``(number_of_node_rows, number_of_node_columns, node_spacing(optional))``, and is clever enough to work with this form.] For a VoronoiDelaunayGrid, the signature will be ``(array_of_node_x_coords, array_of_node_y_coords)``. For a generic component, it will typically be ``(ModelGrid, 'path_to_parameter_file.txt')``, though there may be some variation, and optional inputs may also be available.

Give each object you instantiate a variable name. We like ``mg`` for ModelGrid
objects and some appropriate abbreviation for a component.

An example might be:

.. code-block:: python

    mg = RasterModelGrid((10, 10), xy_spacing(1., 2.))  # 100 nodes, dy=1., dx=2.
    fr = FlowAccumlator(mg)

3. Load/create data in fields
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

(:ref:`See this section<fields>` if you don't know what a Landlab field is.)

Now we need some data to work with. Here we'll assume that you're going to be
working with a DEM-style elevation map across the nodes of the grid, but similar
considerations would apply for any other type of data.

You will likely be in one of two situations regarding the initial data you want
to put on the grid—either you will have some external data source that you want
to load in and use as your initial conditions (e.g., a DEM of some basin, or
some other real topography), or you want to set up some simple analytical
initial condition like a flat surface with noise or an inclined surface.

In both cases, we advocate a two step process: creating a NumPy array of the
data, then loading it into the grid as a field. We can illustrate both of
the above cases:

.. code-block:: python

    mg = RasterModelGrid((10, 10), 1.)  # make a grid
    z = np.zeros(100, dtype=float)  # make a flat surface, elev 0
    # or…
    z = mg.node_y*0.01  # a flat surface dipping shallowly south
    # add a little noise to the surface:
    z += np.random.rand(100.)/10000.
    # create the field:
    mg.add_field('node', 'topographic__elevation', z, units='m')

Alternatively, we can use the specialized Landlab function
:py:func:`read_esri_ascii <landlab.io.esri_ascii.read_esri_ascii>`
to import an ascii raster that can be output from ARC. Note this function both
creates the grid for you and loads the data as a field if you provide ``name``.
If not, you'll have to load the data output (*z*, below) manually

  .. code-block:: python

    from landlab.io import read_esri_ascii
    mg, z = read_esri_ascii('my_ARC_output.asc', name='topographic__elevation')
    np.all(mg.at_node['topographic__elevation'] == z)


Note that if you don't want to use any Landlab components, you can continue to
work with data as "free floating" NumPy arrays, and can ignore the fields (e.g.,
see this `simple introductory tutorial
<https://gist.github.com/jennyknuth/034e696d65aec808b70e>`_).

4. Set the boundary conditions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Once you have a grid and the initial condition data you'll need, it's time to
set the boundary conditions. If you're working with a raster, or some
pre-existing imported data, this is very straightforward using the built in
RasterModelGrid functions. For a raster where only the edges are to be boundary
nodes

  .. code-block:: python

    mg.set_fixed_value_boundaries_at_grid_edges(False, True, False, True)
    mg.set_closed_boundaries_at_grid_edges(True, False, True, False)

This will give a grid with fixed value boundaries at the left and right edges,
and closed boundaries at the top and bottom.

If you're working with, say, an ARC imported array with a null value on the
closed nodes (e.g., -9999), you can do this

  .. code-block:: python

    mg.set_nodata_nodes_to_closed(mg.at_node['topographic__elevation'], -9999)

(Be aware that you're still likely to have to reopen an outlet node manually!
In which case you'll also need to follow the instructions below.)

If you're working with individual node's boundary statuses, you'll need to set
the boundary conditions by hand. This means individually modifying the boundary
condition status of each node or link that you want to be of the new type.
Fortunately, Landlab uses some Python magic to make sure that when you update,
for example, the status of a node, the statuses of attached links and cells
change concomitantly. For example

  .. code-block:: python

    # find the ID of the lowest elevation core node.
    # we'll make this a fixed gradient outlet:
    outlet_id = mg.core_nodes[np.argmin(mg.at_node['topographic__elevation'][mg.core_nodes])]
    # show there are no links with *mg.BC_LINK_IS_FIXED* boundary conditions
    in the grid yet:
    np.any(mg.status_at_link==mg.BC_LINK_IS_FIXED)
    # update the outlet node:
    mg.status_at_node[outlet_id] = mg.BC_LINK_IS_FIXED
    np.any(mg.status_at_link==mg.BC_LINK_IS_FIXED)
    # the corresponding link has been automatically updated.

5. Run the model
++++++++++++++++

We're now ready to actually implement a run of our model! Most things you might
want to do with Landlab are probably time-sensitive, so in almost all cases,
you'll probably be placing the guts of your simulation inside a loop of some
sort. In simple cases, you can just use some variation on a simple for loop or
while statement, either:

.. code-block:: python

    dt = 10.
    for tstep in xrange(100):
        #...do the thing for one timestep dt

or:

.. code-block:: python

    dt = 10.
    accumulated_time = 0.
    while accumulated_time<1000.:
        #...do the thing for one timestep dt
        accumulated_time += dt

Both produce 1000 time units of run, with an explicit timestep of 10. Notice
that the latter technique is particularly amenable to situations where your
explicit timestep is varying (e.g., a storm sequence). (For more on time steps in numerical models see the :ref:`Time Steps<time_steps>` page.)

Landlab also however has a built in storm generator component,
:py:class:`PrecipitationDistribution<landlab.components.uniform_precip.PrecipitationDistribution>`,
which (as its name suggests) acts as a true `Python generator
<https://www.python-course.eu/generators.php>`_. The main method is
:py:func:`yield_storm_interstorm_duration_intensity <landlab.components.uniform_precip.PrecipitationDistribution.yield_storm_interstorm_duration_intensity>`.
This means producing a storm series in Landlab is also very easy:

.. code-block:: python

    from landlab.components.uniform_precip import PrecipitationDistribution
    time_to_run = 500000.
    precip_perturb = PrecipitationDistribution(input_file=input_file_string, total_t=time_to_run)
    for (interval_duration, rainfall_rate) in precip_perturb.yield_storm_interstorm_duration_intensity():
        if rainfall_rate != 0.:
            # ...do the thing, making sure to pass it the current
            # interval_duration and rainfall_rate

Notice that the advantage of the generator is that it just stops when the
desired number of events/time duration has expired! See the end of `this
tutorial
<https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=notebooks/tutorials/component_tutorial/component_tutorial.ipynb>`_
for an example of this generator in action.

What exactly "…do the thing" consists of is up to you. You can either design
your own operations to do in the loop for yourself, or you can implement
processes from Landlab's component library. See :ref:`here
<landlab_components_page>`
for more information on using the components.

6. Finalize and handle the data
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Once the looping is complete, the model is effectively finished. However, you
will still need to output the data somehow! Some options include:

Save or export the data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you're using a raster grid, you can easily save your grid output to either
ESRI ascii (i.e., ARCmap) or open source netCDF formats. netCDF in particular is
a powerful format, and allows easy subsequent re-loading of a Landlab modelgrid
and all its fields. Save your raster like this:

.. code-block:: python

    rmg.save('my_savename.asc', names=['field1','field2'])
    # for esri ascii, only saving the fields 1 and 2

or:

.. code-block:: python

    rmg.save('my_savename.nc')
    # save as netCDF3, saving all fields by default

The former way will give two save files, ``my_savename_field1.asc`` and
``my_savename_field2.asc``. The latter will just give ``my_savename.nc``.

To reload a netCDF file, use the Landlab io function
:py:func:`read_netcdf<landlab.io.netcdf.read.read_netcdf>`

.. code-block:: python

    from landlab.io.netcdf import read_netcdf
    mg = read_netcdf('my_savename.nc')

Note all the original fields you had will automatically be repopulated.

If you're using an irregular grid, the simple grid save function is not yet
operational (though is under development). Instead, we recommend using Pickle, a
native Python way of saving ("pickling") any Python object. It works like this::

    >>> import cPickle as pickle
    # cPickle is a lot faster than normal pickle
    >>> pickle.dump( mg, open('my_savename.pickle', 'wb') )
    # ...save the grid, and all its fields
    >>> mg = pickle.load( open('my_savename.pickle', 'rb') )
    # ...load the grid and fields back into a grid object

Unfortunately, the power of pickle comes somewhat at the expense of both disk
space and speed. Saves this way can be slow and, if the grid is big, memory
expensive (e.g., ~1 Gb for millions of nodes).

You can also use lower level, NumPy save routines to preserve just your data
(rather than the whole grid object). The NumPy methods ``save`` and ``savetxt``
and ``load`` and ``loadtxt`` can be called on any NumPy array, including those
saved as fields. Save and load use the NumPy specific ``.npy`` file format;
``savetxt`` and ``loadtxt`` use ``textfiles``. Use them like this::

    >>> np.save('savename.npy', mg.at_node['my_field'])
    >>> mg.at_node['my_field'] = np.load('savename.npy')
    >>> np.savetxt('savename.txt', mg.at_node['my_field'])
    >>> mg.at_node['my_field'] = np.loadtxt('savename.txt')

Plot the data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Landlab has a fairly comprehensive suite of built in plotting functions; read
more about them :ref:`here<plotting_and_vis>`.

You also of course have the option of using the `matplotlib plotting library
<https://matplotlib.org/>`_ of Python for things like cross-sections.

If you're careful, you can also build plotting functions into the body of a run
loop for your model, so you can see how your output evolves through time. Note
however that all Python save and plot functions are considerably time expensive,
so it would probably be a bad idea to do this kind of thing every timestep.
Instead, you can try something like:

.. code-block:: python

    import plot
    dt = 10.
    accumulated_time = 0.
    last_accumulated_time_remainder = 0.
    while accumulated_time<1000.:
         #...do the thing for one timestep dt
         accumulated_time += dt
    if last_accumulated_time_remainder < accumulated_time%100.:  # output every 100.
         plot(mg.node_vector_to_raster(z)[mg.number_of_node_rows//2,:])  # a cross section
         last_accumulated_time_remainder = accumulated_time%100.
    show()

Note that if you're running inside an interactive Python session like iPython,
all the variables and objects (both grid and component) that you've used in your
model will still be available in the environment. Thus, you can play with your
data for as long as you want!

Animating figures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to issues surrounding platform-dependent video codecs, Landlab does not currently
support native video or animated output. However, numerous effective hacks using free
third party software can be effective. We recommend saving your figure for animation
at the desired frame interval using the matplotlib ``savefig`` command, then
stitching these images together into a video file externally.

DEJH has had a lot of success doing this in Preview on a Mac (which has the great
advantage that it is always available). Simply open the first image, go to ``Export...``
under file, then **while holding down alt** click on the ``Format`` button to gain
access to a list of extra formats, including ``.gif``. Open your new gif file, also
in preview, then just drag the remaining image files into the sidebar onto the first
slide, where they will be appended to the gif as individual frames. Save, and you
will now have an animated gif of your output (note you'll have to open the file in a
browser or drag it into Powerpoint to get it to run - for mysterious reasons,
Preview always opens the frames as images, and cannot show the gif running!).

******************************************
Introduction to Landlab's Gridding Library
******************************************

When creating a two-dimensional simulation model, often the most time-consuming and
error-prone task involves writing the code to set up the underlying grid. Irregular
(or "unstructured") grids are especially tricky to implement. Landlab's **ModelGrid**
package makes this process much easier, by providing a set of library routines for
creating and managing a 2D grid, attaching data to the grid, performing common input
and output operations, and  providing library functions that handle common numerical
operations such as calculating a field of gradients for a particular state variable.
By taking care of much of the overhead involved in writing grid-management code,
**ModelGrid** is designed to help you build 2D models quickly and efficiently, freeing you
to concentrate on the science behind the code.

Some of the things you can do with **ModelGrid** include:

- Create and configure a structured or unstructured grid in a one or a few lines of code
- Create various data arrays attached to the grid
- Easily implement staggered-grid finite-difference/finite-volume schemes
- Calculate gradients in state variables in a single line
- Calculate net fluxes in/out of grid cells in a single line
- Set up and run "link-based" cellular automaton models
- Switch between structured and unstructured grids without needing to change the rest of
  the code
- Develop complete, 2D numerical finite-volume or finite-difference models much more
  quickly and efficiently than would be possible using straight C, Fortran, Matlab, or
  Python code

Some of the Landlab capabilities that work with **ModelGrid** to enable easy numerical modeling include:

- Easily read in model parameters from a formatted text file
- Write grid and data output to netCDF files for import into open-source visualization
  packages such as ParaView and VisIt
- Create grids from ArcGIS-formatted ascii files
- Create models by coupling together your own and/or pre-built process components
- Use models built by others from process components


This document provides a basic introduction to building applications using Landlab's
**ModelGrid**. It covers: (1) how grids are represented, and (2) a set of tutorial examples
that illustrate how to build models using simple scripts.

How a Grid is Represented
-------------------------

.. _basic_grid_elements:

Basic Grid Elements
-------------------

.. figure:: images/grid_schematic_ab.png
    :figwidth: 80%
    :align: center

    *Figure 1*: Elements of a model grid. The main grid elements are nodes, links, cells,
    and faces.
    Less commonly used elements include corners, patches, and junctions. In the
    spring 2015 version of Landlab, **ModelGrid** can implement raster (a) and
    Voronoi-Delaunay (b) grids. Ordered subtypes of Voronoi-Delaunay grids—radial
    and hexagonal—are also available.
    (Note that not all links and patches are shown, and only one representative cell is
    shaded.)

:ref:`Figure 1 <basic_grid_elements>` illustrates
how **ModelGrid** represents a simulation grid. The
grid contains a set of *(x,y)* points called **nodes**. In a typical
finite-difference or finite-volume model, nodes are the locations at which one tracks
scalar state variables, such as water depth, land elevation, sea-surface elevation,
or temperature.

Each adjacent pair of nodes is connected by a line segment known as
a **link**. A link has both a position in space, denoted
by the coordinates of the two bounding nodes, and a direction: a link
runs from one node (known as its **from-node** or **tail-node**) to another node
(known as its **to-node** or **head-node**).

Every node in the grid interior is associated with a polygon known as a **cell** (illustrated,
for example, by the shaded square region in :ref:`Figure 1a <basic_grid_elements>`). Each cell is
bounded by a set of line segments known as **faces**, which it shares with its neighboring
cells.

In the simple case of a regular (raster) grid, the cells are square, the nodes
are the center points of the cells (:ref:`Figure 1 <basic_grid_elements>`), and the links and faces have
identical length (equal to the node spacing). In a Voronoi-Delaunay grid, the
cells are Voronoi polygons (also known as Theissen polygons)
(:ref:`Figure 1a <basic_grid_elements>`). In this case, each cell represents the surface area that
is closer to its own node than to any other node in the grid. The faces
represent locations that are equidistant between two neighboring nodes. Other grid
configurations are possible as well. The spring 2015 version of Landlab includes
support for hexagonal and radial grids, which are specialized versions of the
Voronoi-Delaunay grid shown in :ref:`Figure 1a <basic_grid_elements>`. Note that the node-link-cell-face
topology is general enough to represent other types of grid; for example, one could use
**ModelGrid's** data structures to implement a quad-tree grid,
or a Delaunay-Voronoi grid in which cells are triangular elements with
nodes at their circumcenters.

Creating a Grid
---------------

Creating a grid is easy.  The first step is to import Landlab's
:py:class:`RasterModelGrid <landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid>` class (this
assumes you have :ref:`installed Landlab <install>`
and are working in your favorite
:ref:`Python environment <python_installation>`):

.. code-block:: python

    from landlab import RasterModelGrid

Now, create a regular (raster) grid with 10 rows and 40 columns, with a node spacing (dx) of 5:

.. code-block:: python

    mg = RasterModelGrid((10, 40), 5.)

*mg* is now a grid object with 400 ``( 10*40 )`` nodes and 750 ``( 40*(10-1) + 30*(10-1) )`` links.

.. code-block:: python

    mg.number_of_node_columns
    40
    mg.number_of_nodes
    400
    mg.number_of_links
    750

.. _fields:

Adding Data to a Landlab Grid Element using Fields
--------------------------------------------------

Landlab has a data structure called *fields* that will store data associated with different types
of grid elements. Fields are convenient because 1) fields create data arrays of the proper length for
the associated grid element, and 2) fields attach these data to the grid, so that any piece of code that has
access to the grid also has access to the data stored in fields.

Suppose you would like like to
track the elevation at each node. The following code creates a data field
(array) called *elevation*. In this case, we'll use the grid method
*add_zeros* to create a field that initially sets all values in the field to
zero (we'll explain how to read in elevation values from a file in the section
on :ref:`DEMs below <importing_a_dem>`). The *add_zeros* method takes
two arguments: the name of the grid element (in this case, *node*, in the
singular) and a name we choose for the value in the data field (here we'll just
call it *elevation*). Each *elevation* value in the data field is then
associated with a specific grid node. The data field is just a NumPy array
whose length is equal to the number of nodes in the grid.

.. code-block:: python

    z = mg.add_zeros("elevation", at="node")

Here *z* is an array of zeros. We can verify that *z* has the same length as the number of nodes:

.. code-block:: python

    z.size  # or len(z)
    400

Note that *z* is a reference to the data stored in the model field. This means that if you change z, you
also change the data in the ModelGrid's elevation field. Therefore, you can access and manipulate data in the field either through the variable *z* or through the grid, as in the following examples:

.. code-block:: python

    mg.at_node["elevation"][5] = 1000.0

or the alternative notation:

.. code-block:: python

    mg['node']['elevation'][5]
    1000.

Now the sixth element in the model's elevation field array, or in *z*, is equal to 1000.  (Remember that the first element of a Python array has an index of 0 (zero)).

You can see all of the field data available at the nodes on *mg* with the following:

.. code-block:: python

    mg.at_node.keys()
    ['elevation']

You may recognize this as a dictionary-type structure, where
the keys are the names (as strings) of the data arrays.

There are currently no data values (fields) assigned to the links, as shown by the following:

.. code-block:: python

    mg.at_link.keys()
    []

It is also possible, and indeed, often quite useful, to initialize a field from an
existing NumPy array of data. You can do this with the
:py:func:`add_field <landlab.field.grouped.ModelDataFields.add_field>` method.
This method allows slightly more granular control over how the field gets
created. In addition to the grid element and field name, this method takes an
array of values to assign to the field. Optional arguments include: ``units=``
to assign a unit of measurement (as a string) to the value, ``copy=`` a boolean
to determine whether to make a copy of the data, and ``clobber=`` a boolean
that prevents accidentally overwriting an existing field.

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    elevs_in = np.random.rand(mg.number_of_nodes)
    mg.add_field("elevation", elevs_in, at="node", units="m", copy=True, clobber=True)

Fields can store data at nodes, cells, links, faces, patches, junctions, and corners (though the
latter two or three are very rarely, if ever, used). The grid element you select is
described in Landlab jargon as that field's *centering* or *group*, and you will
sometimes see these terms used as input parameters to various grid methods.

To access only the core nodes, core cells, active links, or some other subset of node values using the
properties available through the ModelGrid, you can specify a subset of the field data array. For example, if we wanted to determine the elevations at core nodes only we can do the following:

.. code-block:: python

    core_node_elevs = mg.at_node["elevation"][mg.core_nodes]

The first set of brackets, in this case *elevation*, indicates the field data array, and the second set of brackets, in this case *mg.core_nodes* (itself an array of core node IDs), is a NumPy filter that specifies which *elevation* elements to return.

Here is another example of initializing a field with the *add_ones* method. Note that when initializing a field, the singular of the grid
element type is provided:

.. code-block:: python

    veg = mg.add_ones("percent_vegetation", at="cell")
    mg.at_cell.keys()
    ['percent_vegetation']

Here *veg* is an array of ones that has the same length as the number of cells. Because there are
no cells around the edge of a grid, there are fewer cells than nodes:

.. code-block:: python

    mg.at_cell['percent_vegetation'].size
    304

As you can see, fields are convenient because you don't have to keep track of how many nodes, links, cells, etc.
there are on the grid. It is easy for any part of the code to query what data are already associated with the grid and operate on these data.

You are free to call your fields whatever you want. However, field names are
more useful if standardized across components. If you are writing a Landlab component
you should use :ref:`Landlab's standard names <component_standard_names>`.
Standard names for fields in a particular component can be
accessed individually through the properties
*component_instance._input_var_names* and *component_instance._output_var_names*
(returned as dictionaries), and are listed in the docstring for each component.

.. code-block:: python

    from landlab.components.flexure import Flexure
    flexer = Flexure(rg)
    flexer._input_var_names
    {'lithosphere__elevation',
     'lithosphere__overlying_pressure',
     'planet_surface_sediment__deposition_increment'}
    flexer._output_var_names
    {'lithosphere__elevation', 'lithosphere__elevation_increment'}

We also maintain this list of all the
:ref:`Landlab standard names <component_standard_names>`.

Our fields also offer direct compatibility with `CSDMS's standard naming system for
variables <https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/CSDMS_Standard_Names>`_.
However, note that, for ease of use and readability, Landlab standard
names are typically much shorter than CSDMS standard names. We anticipate that future
Landlab versions will be able to automatically map from Landlab standard names to CSDMS
standard names as part of Landlab's built-in `Basic Model Interface for CSDMS
compatibility <https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/BMI_Description>`_.

The following gives an overview of the commands you can use to interact with the grid fields.

Field initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``grid.add_empty(name, at="group", units="-")``
* ``grid.add_ones(name, at="group", units="-")``
* ``grid.add_zeros(name, at="group", units="-")``

"group" is one of 'node', 'link', 'cell', 'face', 'corner', 'junction', 'patch'

"name" is a string giving the field name

"units" (optional) is a string denoting the units associated with the field values.


Field creation from existing data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``grid.add_field(name, value_array, at="group", units="-", copy=False, clobber=True)``

Arguments as above, plus:

"value_array" is a correctly sized numpy array of data from which you want to create the field.

"copy" (optional) if True adds a *copy* of value_array to the field; if False, creates a reference to value_array.

"clobber" (optional) if `False`, raises an exception if a field called name already exists.


Field access
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``grid.at_node`` or ``grid['node']``
* ``grid.at_cell`` or ``grid['cell']``
* ``grid.at_link`` or ``grid['link']``
* ``grid.at_face`` or ``grid['face']``
* ``grid.at_corner`` or ``grid['corner']``
* ``grid.at_junction`` or ``grid['junction']``
* ``grid.at_patch`` or ``grid['patch']``

Each of these is then followed by the field name as a string in square brackets, e.g.,

>>> grid.at_node['my_field_name'] #or
>>> grid['node']['my_field_name']

You can also use these commands to create fields from existing arrays,
as long as you don't want to take advantage of the added control ``add_field()`` gives you.


.. _getting_info_about_fields:

Getting information about fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Landlab offers a command line interface that lets you find out about all the fields that are in use across all the Landlab components. You can find out the following:

``$ landlab used_by [ComponentName]``  # What fields does ComponentName take as inputs?

``$ landlab provided_by [ComponentName]``  # What fields does ComponentName give as outputs?

``$ landlab uses [field__name]``  # What components take the field field__name as an input?

``$ landlab provides [field__name]``  # What components give the field field__name as an output?

``$ landlab list``  # list all the components

``$ (landlab provided_by && landlab used_by) | sort | uniq``  # some command line magic to see all the fields currently used in components


Representing Gradients in a Landlab Grid
----------------------------------------

Finite-difference and finite-volume models usually need to calculate spatial
gradients in one or more scalar variables, and often these gradients are
evaluated between pairs of adjacent nodes. ModelGrid makes these calculations
easier for programmers by providing built-in functions to calculate gradients
along links and allowing applications to associate an array of gradient values
with their corresponding links or edges. The `tutorial examples
<https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=notebooks/welcome.ipynb>`_
illustrate how this capability can be used to create models of processes
such as diffusion and overland flow.

Here we simply illustrate the method for
calculating gradients on the links.  Remember that we have already created the
elevation array z, which is also accessible from the elevation field on *mg*.

.. code-block:: python

    gradients = mg.calculate_gradients_at_active_links(z)

Now gradients have been calculated at all links that are active, or links on which
flow is possible (see boundary conditions below).


Other Grid Elements
-------------------

The cell vertices are called *corners* (`Figure 1, solid squares <basic_grid_elements>`).
Each face is therefore a line segment connecting two corners. The intersection
of a face and a link (or directed edge) is known as a *junction*
(:ref:`Figure 1, open diamonds <basic_grid_elements>`). Often, it is useful to calculate scalar
values (say, ice thickness in a glacier) at nodes, and vector values (say, ice
velocity) at junctions. This approach is sometimes referred to as a
staggered-grid scheme. It lends itself naturally to finite-volume methods, in
which one computes fluxes of mass, momentum, or energy across cell faces, and
maintains conservation of mass within cells.  (In the spring 2015 version of Landlab,
there are no supporting functions for the use of junctions, but support is imminent.)

Notice that the links also enclose a set of polygons that are offset from the
cells. These secondary polygons are known as *patches* (:ref:`Figure 1,
dotted <basic_grid_elements>`). This means that any grid comprises two complementary tesselations: one
made of cells, and one made of patches. If one of these is a Voronoi
tessellation, the other is a Delaunay triangulation. For this reason, Delaunay
triangulations and Voronoi diagrams are said to be dual to one another: for any
given Delaunay triangulation, there is a unique corresponding Voronoi diagram.
With **ModelGrid,** one can
create a mesh with Voronoi polygons as cells and Delaunay triangles as patches
(:ref:`Figure 1b <basic_grid_elements>`). Alternatively, with a raster grid, one simply has
two sets of square elements that are offset by half the grid spacing
(:ref:`Figure 1a <basic_grid_elements>`). Whatever the form of the tessellation, **ModelGrid** keeps
track of the geometry and topology of the grid. patches can be useful for processes
like calculating the mean gradient at a node, incorporating influence from its
neighbors.

Managing Grid Boundaries
------------------------

An important component of any numerical model is the method for handling
boundary conditions. In general, it's up to the application developer to manage
boundary conditions for each variable. However, **ModelGrid** makes this task a bit
easier by tagging nodes that are treated as boundaries (*boundary nodes*)
and those that are treated as regular nodes belonging to the interior
computational domain (*core nodes*). It also allows you to de-activate ("close")
portions of the grid perimeter, so that they effectively act as walls.

Let's look first at how ModelGrid treats its own geometrical boundaries. The
outermost elements of a grid are nodes and links (as opposed to corners and
faces). For example, :ref:`Figure 2 <raster4x5>` shows a sketch of a regular
four-row by five-column grid created by RasterModelGrid. The edges of the grid
are composed of nodes and links. Only the inner six nodes have cells around
them; the remaining 14 nodes form the perimeter of the grid.

.. _raster4x5:

.. figure:: images/example_raster_grid.png
    :figwidth: 80%
    :align: center

    Figure 2: Illustration of a simple four-row by five-column raster grid created with
    :py:class:`landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid <landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid>`.
    By default, all perimeter
    nodes are tagged as open (fixed value) boundaries, and all interior cells
    are tagged as core. An active link is one that connects either
    two core nodes, or one core node and one open boundary node.

All nodes are tagged as either *boundary* or *core*. Those on the
perimeter of the grid are automatically tagged as boundary nodes. Nodes on the
inside are *core* by default, but it is possible to tag some of them as
*boundary* instead (this would be useful, for example, if you wanted to
represent an irregular region, such as a watershed, inside a regular grid). In the example
shown in :ref:`Figure 2 <raster4x5>`, all the interior nodes are *core*, and all
perimeter nodes are *open boundary*.

Boundary nodes are flagged as either *open* or *closed*, and links are tagged as
either *active* or *inactive* (Figure 3).

.. _raster4x5openclosed:

.. figure:: images/example_raster_grid_with_closed_boundaries.png
    :figwidth: 80 %
    :align: center

    Figure 3: Illustration of a simple four-row by five-column raster grid with a
    combination of open and closed boundaries.

A closed boundary is one at which no flux is permitted enter or leave, ever.
By definition, all links coming into or out of a closed boundary node must be inactive.
There is effectively no value assigned to a closed boundary; it will probably have a
grid.BAD_INDEX_VALUE or null value of some kind.
An open boundary is one at which flux can enter or leave, but whose value is controlled
by some boundary condition rule, updated at the end of each timestep.

An *active link*
is one that joins either two core nodes, or one *core* and one
*open boundary* node (Figure 3). You can use this
distinction in models to implement closed boundaries by performing flow
calculations only on active links, as seen in `this tutorial
<https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=notebooks/tutorials/fault_scarp_notebook/landlab-fault-scarp.ipynb>`_.


.. _bc_details:

Boundary condition details and methods
--------------------------------------

A call to mg.node_status returns the codes representing the boundary condition
of each node in the grid. There are 5 possible types, they are stored on the
model grid:

* mg.BC_NODE_IS_CORE (Type 0)
* mg.BC_NODE_IS_FIXED_VALUE (Type 1)
* mg.BC_NODE_IS_FIXED_GRADIENT (Type 2)
* mg.BC_NODE_IS_LOOPED (Type 3, used for looped boundaries)
* mg.BC_NODE_IS_CLOSED (Type 4)

A number of different methods are available to you to interact with (i.e., set and
update) boundary conditions at nodes. Landlab is smart enough to automatically
initialize new grids with fixed value boundary conditions at all perimeters and core
nodes for all interior nodes, but if you want something else, you'll need to modify
the boundary conditions.

If you are working with a simple Landlab raster where all interior nodes are core and
all perimeter nodes are boundaries, you will find useful the set of commands:

* ``mg.set_closed_boundaries_at_grid_edges(right, top, left, bottom)``
* ``mg.set_fixed_value_boundaries_at_grid_edges(right, top, left, bottom)``
* ``mg.set_fixed_link_boundaries_at_grid_edges(right, top, left, bottom, link_value=None)``
* ``mg.set_looped_boundaries(top_bottom_are_looped, left_right_are_looped)``

Where right, top, left, bottom are all booleans. See the relevant docstring for each
method for more detailed information.

If you are working with an imported irregularly shaped raster grid, you can close nodes
which have some fixed NODATA value in the raster using:

* ``mg.set_nodata_nodes_to_closed(node_data, nodata_value)``

Note that all of these commands will treat the status of node links as slave to the
status of the nodes, as indicated in Figure 3.
Links will be set to active or inactive according to what you set the node boundary
conditions as, when you call each method.

If you are working on an irregular grid, or want to do something more complicated
with your raster boundary conditions, you will need to modify the
``grid.status_at_node`` array by hand, using indexes to node IDs. Simply import the
boundary types from landlab then set the node statuses. The links will be updated
alongside these changes automatically:

.. code-block:: python

    mg - RasterModelGrid((5,5))
    mg.set_closed_boundaries_at_grid_edges(False, True, False, True)
    mg.number_of_active_links
    18
    mg.status_at_node[[6, 8]] = mg.BC_NODE_IS_CLOSED
    mg.status_at_node.reshape((5,5))
    array([[4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
           [1, 4, 0, 4, 1],
           [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
           [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
           [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]], dtype=int8)
    mg.number_of_active_links  # links were inactivated automatically when we closed nodes
    12

Note that while setting Landlab boundary conditions on the grid is straightforward, it
is up to the individual developer of each Landlab component to ensure it is compatible
with these boundary condition schemes! Almost all existing components work fine with
core, closed, and fixed_value conditions, but some may struggle with fixed_gradient,
and most will struggle with looped. If you're working with the component library, take
a moment to check your components can understand your implemented boundary conditions!
See the :ref:`Component Developer's Guide <dev_contributing>` for more information.


Using a Different Grid Type
---------------------------

As noted earlier, Landlab provides several different types of grid. Available grids
(as of this writing) are listed in the table below. Grids are designed using Python
classes, with more specialized grids inheriting properties and behavior from more
general types. The class hierarchy is given in the second column, **Inherits from**.

+-------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+
| Grid type               | Inherits from           | Node arrangement   | Cell geometry     |
+=========================+=========================+====================+===================+
| ``RasterModelGrid``     | ``ModelGrid``           | raster             | squares           |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+
| ``VoronoiDelaunayGrid`` | ``ModelGrid``           | Delaunay triangles | Voronoi polygons  |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+
| ``HexModelGrid``        | ``VoronoiDelaunayGrid`` | triagonal          | hexagons          |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+
| ``RadialModelGrid``     | ``VoronoiDelaunayGrid`` | concentric         | Voronoi polygons  |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+

:py:class:`landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid <landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid>`
gives a regular (square) grid, initialized
with *number_of_node_rows*, *number_of_node_columns*, and a *spacing*.
In a :py:class:`landlab.grid.voronoi.VoronoiDelaunayGrid <landlab.grid.voronoi.VoronoiDelaunayGrid>`,
a set of node coordinates
is given as an initial condition.
Landlab then forms a Delaunay triangulation, so that the links between nodes are the
edges of the triangles, and the cells are Voronoi polygons.
A :py:class:`landlab.grid.hex.HexModelGrid <landlab.grid.hex.HexModelGrid>` is a
special type of VoronoiDelaunayGrid in which the Voronoi cells happen to be
regular hexagons.
In a :py:class:`landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid <landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid>`, nodes are created in concentric
circles and then connected to
form a Delaunay triangulation (again with Voronoi polygons as cells).

.. _importing_a_dem:

Importing a DEM
---------------

Landlab offers the methods
:py:func:`landlab.io.esri_ascii.read_esri_ascii <landlab.io.esri_ascii.read_esri_ascii>` and
:py:func:`landlab.io.netcdf.read_netcdf <landlab.io.netcdf.read_netcdf>` to allow ingestion of
existing digital elevation models as raster grids.

**read_esri_ascii** allows import of an ARCmap formatted ascii file (.asc or .txt)
as a grid.
It returns a tuple, containing the grid and the elevations in Landlab ID order.
Use the *name* keyword to add the elevation to a field in the imported grid.

.. code-block:: python

    from landlab.io import read_esri_ascii
    (mg, z) = read_esri_ascii("myARCoutput.txt", name="topographic__elevation")
    mg.at_node.keys()
    ['topographic__elevation']

**read_netcdf** allows import of the open source netCDF format for DEMs. Fields will
automatically be created according to the names of variables found in the file.
Returns a :py:class:`landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid <landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid>`.

.. code-block:: python

    from landlab.io.netcdf import read_netcdf
    mg = read_netcdf("mynetcdf.nc")


After import, you can use :py:func:`landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.set_nodata_nodes_to_closed
<landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.set_nodata_nodes_to_closed>`
to handle the boundary conditions in your imported DEM.

Equivalent methods for output are also available for both esri ascii
(:py:func:`landlab.io.esri_ascii.write_esri_ascii <landlab.io.esri_ascii.write_esri_ascii>`)
and netCDF
(:py:func:`landlab.io.netcdf.write_netcdf <landlab.io.netcdf.write_netcdf>`) formats.


.. _plotting_and_vis:

Plotting and Visualization
--------------------------

Visualizing a Grid
------------------

Landlab offers a set of matplotlib-based plotting routines for your data. These exist
in the landlab.plot library. You'll also need to import some basic plotting functions
from pylab (or matplotlib) to let you control your plotting output: at a minimum **show**
and **figure**. The most useful function is called
:py:func:`landlab.plot.imshow.imshow_node_grid <landlab.plot.imshow.imshow_node_grid>`, and is imported
and used as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from landlab.plot.imshow import imshow_node_grid
    from pylab import show, figure
    mg - RasterModelGrid((50, 50), 1.)  # make a grid to plot
    z - mg.node_x * 0.1 #make an arbitrary sloping surface
    #create the data as a field
    mg.add_field("topographic_elevation", z, at="node", units="meters", copy=True)
    figure('Elevations from the field')  # new fig, with a name
    imshow_node_grid(mg, 'topographic_elevation')
    figure('You can also use values directly, not fields')
    #...but if you, do you'll lose the units, figure naming capabilities, etc
    imshow_node_grid(mg, z)
    show()

Note that :py:func:`landlab.plot.imshow.imshow_node_grid <landlab.plot.imshow.imshow_node_grid>`
is clever enough to examine the grid object you pass it,
work out whether the grid is irregular or regular, and plot the data appropriately.

By default, Landlab uses a Python colormap called *'pink'*. This was a deliberate choice
to improve Landlab's user-friendliness to the colorblind in the science community.
Nonetheless, you can easily override this color scheme using the keyword *cmap* as an
argument to imshow_node_grid. Other useful built in colorschemes are *'bone'* (black
to white), *'jet'*, (blue to red, through green), *'Blues'* (white to blue), and
*'terrain'* (blue-green-brown-white) (note these names are case sensitive).
See `the matplotlib reference guide
<https://matplotlib.org//examples/color/colormaps_reference.html>`_ for more options.
Note that imshow_node_grid takes many of the same keyword arguments as, and is designed
to resemble, the standard matplotlib function `imshow
<https://matplotlib.org//users/image_tutorial.html>`_. See also the method help for more
details.
In particular, note you can set the maximum and minimum you want for your colorbar using
the keywords *vmin* and *vmax*, much as in similar functions in the matplotlib library.

**Note if using Anaconda**: there have been documented issues with resolution with default inline plotting within the Spyder IDE iPython console. To generate dynamic plots (e.g. Matlab-like plots), change the graphics settings in Spyder by following this work flow:

In *Spyder -> Preferences -> iPython console -> Graphics -> Graphics Backend -> Automatic -> Apply -> OK -> Make sure to restart Spyder to update the preferences.*

Visualizing transects through your data
---------------------------------------

If you are working with a regular grid, it is trivial to plot horizontal and vertical
sections through your data. The grid provides the method
:py:func:`landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.node_vector_to_raster <landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.node_vector_to_raster>`,
which will turn a Landlab 1D node data array into a two dimensional rows*columns NumPy array,
which you can then take slices of, e.g., we can do this:

.. code-block:: python

    from pylab import plot, show
    mg = RasterModelGrid((10, 10), 1.)
    z = mg.node_x * 0.1
    my_section = mg.node_vector_to_raster(z, flip_vertically=True)[:,5]
    my_ycoords = mg.node_vector_to_raster(mg.node_y, flip_vertically=True)[:,5]
    plot(my_ycoords, my_section)
    show()


Visualizing river profiles
--------------------------

See the :py:class:`ChannelProfiler <landlab.components.profiler.ChannelProfiler>`
component.

Making Movies
-------------

Landlab does have an experimental movie making component. However, it has come to the
developers' attention that the matplotlib functions it relies on in turn demand that
your machine already has installed one of a small set of highly temperamental open
source video codecs. It is quite likely using the component in its current form is
more trouble than it's worth; however, the brave can take a look at the library
:py:mod:`landlab.plot.video_out <landlab.plot.video_out>`. We intend to improve
video out in future Landlab releases.

For now, we advocate the approach of creating an animation by saving separately
individual plots from, e.g., **plot()** or
:py:func:`landlab.plot.imshow.imshow_node_grid <landlab.plot.imshow.imshow_node_grid>`,
then stitching them together
into, e.g., a gif using external software. Note it's possible to do this directly from
Preview on a Mac.

How Landlab Is/Is Not Unit Agnostic
-----------------------------------

This page describes how Landlab handles units. Our approach is intended to
balance usability, effective communication of component expectations to users,
and a low barrier for developers.

Component inputs and outputs with units may be fields (arrays stored on the
grid), or arguments/keyword arguments to the component instantiation and run
functions.

All components require that a user is consistent between the space/time/mass
units used within one and across multiple components. For example, if you were
to couple a ``StreamPowerEroder`` and a ``LinearDiffuser`` your x, y, and z
coordinates, the field `topographic__elevation` and all input parameters would
need to share a common length unit. Further, input parameters with units that
include time and your time step would need to share a common time unit.

Components that require that you are consistent with units but do not care
whether you use feet or meters for your length unit are called "unit agnostic".
You can find out if a component is unit agnostic by querying the attribute:
``Component.unit_agnostic`` which will return ``True`` or ``False``.

Unit agnostic components will provide specific units in the field and parameter
metadata. However, no computation within a unit agnostic component assumes a
specific unit. If you provide a consistent set of inputs, you can use whichever
units you prefer. Note that this may require specifying ALL keyword arguments
(e.g., if gravitational acceleration as 9.81 m/s^2 is a default value, you must
provide 32.2 ft/s^2 as an input if you want to use feet as your length unit).

In contrast to unit-agnostic components, non-unit-agnostic components REQUIRE
that a specific set of units be used. This typically occurs because built into
the source code of the computation are assumptions or conversions about the
units of inputs.

When it doubt, the best approach is to open a GitHub issue.

Below is a list of non-unit agnostic components current as of February 2020:

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

I can't install/test/run Landlab, what should I do?
---------------------------------------------------

If you are having trouble when installing, testing or running Landlab, please
visit our :ref:`Troubleshooting page <troubleshooting>`.


What is the difference between a cell and a node?
-------------------------------------------------

A cell is a polygon surrounding a node. Nodes on the grid perimeter do not have
cells. Cells have area, nodes have coordinates.

Why is my node data a 1d array? I'm using a raster...
-----------------------------------------------------

All Landlab data structures have to be compatible with both regular and
irregular grids. A 2d structure for node data might make sense for a raster,
but it wouldn't work for an irregular grid - and moreover, there is also no
sensible way to represent link data as a 2d raster either, even for a raster.
Thus, instead, Landlab stores all data in an order set by *node ID number*.
For a raster, IDs begin at zero in the bottom left corner of the grid, then
run along each row in turn. For links, the IDs also start in the bottom left
and run across then up, but in this case all vertical links are listed, then
all horizontal links. Here's a sketch summary of this scheme for a 4x5 raster::

    NODES:                                    LINKS:
    15------16------17------18------19        *--27-->*--28-->*--29-->*--30-->*
    |       |       |       |       |         ^       ^       ^       ^       ^
    |       |       |       |       |        22      23      24      25      26
    |       |       |       |       |         |       |       |       |       |
    10------11------12------13------14        *--18-->*--19-->*--20-->*--21-->*
    |       |       |       |       |         ^       ^       ^       ^       ^
    |       |       |       |       |        13      14      15      16      17
    |       |       |       |       |         |       |       |       |       |

    |       |       |       |       |         |       |       |       |       |
    0-------1-------2-------3-------4         *---0-->*---1-->*---2-->*---3-->*


How do I set the boundary codes for the edges of a grid?
--------------------------------------------------------

By default, the boundary nodes around the perimeter of a grid are all
open boundaries. For a raster grid, if you want to make one or more sides
closed boundaries, use the grid method
:py:func:`RasterModelGrid.set_closed_boundaries_at_grid_edges <RasterModelGrid.set_closed_boundaries_at_grid_edges>`.

The following code snippet sets the southern boundary nodes to be closed:

.. code-block:: python

  import landlab
  grid = landlab.RasterModelGrid(3, 4)
  grid.set_closed_boundaries_at_grid_edges(True, False, False, False)
  grid.status_at_node
  array([4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=int8)

It's also possible to set the boundary conditions "by hand", if you know the ID of the element you're trying to change:
:

.. code-block:: python

  mynodes_to_close = z < 0.  # if z is some elevation field
  grid.status_at_node[mynodes_to_close] = grid.BC_NODE_IS_CLOSED
  my_fixed_node = mg.find_nearest_node((1.2, 2.3))
  my_fixed_node
  9
  grid.status_at_node[my_fixed_node] = grid.BC_NODE_IS_FIXED_GRADIENT  # to fix the node closest to (1.2, 2.3)

See also:

  - :py:func:`RasterModelGrid.set_fixed_value_boundaries_at_grid_edges <landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.set_fixed_value_boundaries_at_grid_edges>`
  - :py:func:`ModelGrid.set_nodata_nodes_to_closed <landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.set_nodata_nodes_to_closed>`


Can I import Landlab output into ParaView or VisIt?
---------------------------------------------------

See :ref:`How do I get netCDF output? <how_do_i_get_netcdf_output>` below.

.. _how_do_i_get_netcdf_output:

How do I get netCDF output?
---------------------------

At present, Landlab can write output to a netCDF file if you are using a raster grid
(support for unstructured grids is coming later). To create netCDF output, use the function
:py:func:`landlab.io.netcdf.write_netcdf <landlab.io.netcdf.write_netcdf>`.
This function will write to file

(1) the grid geometry, and
(2) any data arrays that are linked to the grid

this will automatically include any arrays that you created with functions
such as
:py:func:`landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.add_zeros <landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.add_zeros>`,
as long as you provided a name for the array as one of the arguments.


How do I assign values from nodes to links?
-------------------------------------------

Suppose you have a set of values, such as water depths, that are defined at nodes. How do
you figure out what the corresponding values would be at the links, so you can multiply
these by some other quantity (such as water-surface slope) that is defined on links? Here
are some options:

(1) assign the *average*
(2) assign the upstream value
(3) assign the downstream value

Look at this
`Tutorial <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=notebooks/tutorials/file=mappers/mappers.ipynb>`_
for all the Landlab mappers

How do I test whether my grid is regular or irregular?
------------------------------------------------------

There are a number of cases when designing Landlab components where you'll want to do
something one way if the grid is a raster, or another if it's a Voronoi-derived type.
The way to do this is:

.. code-block:: python

    from landlab import RasterModelGrid, VoronoiDelaunayGrid
    # ...
    if isinstance(mg, RasterModelGrid):
        print('Doing it one way')
    elif isinstance(mg, VoronoiDelaunayGrid):
        print('Doing it the other way')
    else:
        raise TypeError('Landlab did not recognize your grid type!')


How do I modify boundary conditions for part of the grid where I know the coordinates?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See `this tutorial <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=notebooks/tutorials/boundary_conds/set_BCs_from_xy.ipynb>`_.

I am having trouble installing Landlab on Ubuntu without Anaconda. What is the fix?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Andy Wickert (5/16) suggests the following:

"The version of setuptools that comes standard on Ubuntu is out-of-date with respect to Landlab's Cython code. Here is the fix:"

.. code-block:: python

    sudo apt-get install python-setuptools # if you don't have it already
    sudo easy_install pip
    sudo apt-get remove python-setuptools
    pip install setuptools # add "--upgrade" if needed

And then you can cd to landlab and this works:

.. code-block:: python

    pip install -e .

Support: How can I ask more questions and get help?

User Guide

The User Guide describes Landlab by topic area.

Users brand-new to Landlab should start with :ref:`10min`.

Further information on any specific method can be obtained in the
:ref:`api`.

The Landlab project creates an environment in which scientists can build a
numerical surface process model without having to code all of the individual
components. Surface process models compute flows of mass, such as water, sediment,
glacial ice, volcanic material, or landslide debris, across a gridded terrain
surface. Surface process models have a number of commonalities, such as operating
on a grid of points and routing material across the grid. Scientists who want
to use a surface process model often build their own unique model from the ground
up, re-coding the basic building blocks of their surface process model rather than
taking advantage of codes that have already been written.

A list of papers and presentations using Landlab can be found :ref:`here <papers>`.

Time steps
==========

Anyone who has taken a numerical computing course knows the importance of
time-step size: choose too small a step and your calculation takes forever to
run; choose too big a step and it goes unstable. The details depend, of course,
on the particular equations and the numerical method used to solve them.

Components and time steps
_________________________

Landlab components are responsible for ensuring their own stability. This
means, for example, that if your code asks a component to run for 10 years, the
component needs to make sure 10 years isn't too big a step to handle. If it is,
the component should subdivide the 10 years into smaller steps that are stable
and accurate. For example, if the component determines that 1 year is the
biggest step it can get away with, then it should divide the requested 10-year
run into 10 steps of 1 year each. If the component uses variable-size time
steps, then it should subdivide the 10 years as it needs, and return when it
has used up exactly 10 years.

Even if each component ensures its own stability, it is still possible for a
multi-component model to get into trouble by using "global" time steps that
are too large. The risk arises because during each global time step, you are
effectively de-coupling the components for a small interval of time. For
example, suppose you have one component that calculates solar radiation on a
landscape and another that calculates the resulting evapotranspiration (ET).
When you run the ET component, you assume that the radiation is constant for
the duration of the time step—as if the sun's position in the sky became frozen
for that period of time. That's probably a reasonable assumption if your time
step is 5 minutes long, but obviously problematic if you time step is 12 hours!
The moral of the story: test your model with different global time-step sizes
to identify a time step that is small enough not to impact the solution in a
significant way.

To learn more about time steps, numerical stability, and solution accuracy, a
good source is `Numerical Recipes by Press et al <http://numerical.recipes/>`_.
There are also plenty of textbooks on numerical computing available.

=====================
The Component Library
=====================

Landlab offers an ever-growing library of components that aim to describe
individual or closely associated suites of surface processes. Components are
designed to be "plug-and-play" and to interact with each other with the minimum
of technical difficulties. Each component makes use of Landlab grid fields to
enable the sharing of data between the components, and we aim to have a
relatively standardized way of interacting with and using each different one.

Landlab components exist as classes, and can be imported from
``landlab.components``.

To develop your own Landlab component, see
:ref:`this page <dev_contributing>`
and
`this tutorial <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=notebooks/tutorials/making_components/making_components.ipynb>`_.

Component Library Tutorial
----------------------------
For a tutorial introduction to using the component library, see
`here <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=notebooks/tutorials/component_tutorial/component_tutorial.ipynb>`_.

Available Landlab components
----------------------------

For the complete list of Landlab components type the following command in a
command prompt:

``landlab list``

See the :ref:`Components section <api.components>` of the Landlab reference
manual for a list of all Landlab components currently available.

Landlab component classes, their import, and their instantiation
----------------------------------------------------------------

Almost all Landlab components exist as Python classes. This means that to use
them, you must first import the class, then ``instantiate`` a Python instance
of that class, then call a method from the class to run the component. The way
this is done has now been almost totally standardised across Landlab.

A component class is imported from the library as

.. code-block:: python

    from landlab.components import [ComponentClass]

e.g., to get the linear diffusion component, we would do:

.. code-block:: python

    from landlab.components import LinearDiffuser

The available components are listed in the
:ref:`Components section <api.components>` of the Landlab Reference Manual.

Component classes always take a copy of the grid as their first argument. They
then take a sequence of additional keyword arguments that set the actual
parameters for the component. This means that the instantiation of a component
looks something like
this:

.. code-block:: python

    dfn = LinearDiffuser(grid, 'linear_diffusivity'=0.01)

These keywords can also be set by passing a Python dictionary, or using a text
input file (see below).

Here, `dfn` is now the `component object`—an "instance" of the component. We
can run it by calling its run method. The component's documentation will
explain how to do this for each individual case, but typically a component will
have a method called `run_one_step`, which can be called like this:

.. code-block:: python

    dt = 100.  # the timestep
    dfn.run_one_step(dt)

If the component describes a time-varying process, the first argument of
`run_one_step` will be the duration for which to run the component in this
timestep. (If the component is not time sensitive, e.g., the `FlowRouter`,
it won't take `dt`). Some components may also allow/require additional input
parameters to their run method; see individual component documentation for more
details.

Running one of these methods will update the fields held in common by the
single grid object which you linked to all your components during component
instantiation. If you look inside the grid fields having run one of these
methods, you'll see the new fields it has created and populated. The docstrings
for the component should make it clear which fields the component needs to have
in the grid as inputs, and which it modifies and/or creates as outputs.

It should probably be emphasized here to **always read the documentation for
the component you are using**! You can get at this documentation either on this
website, or in a dynamic Python session by getting help for either the imported
class or the instantiated component object. i.e., in this case, any of the
following would work::

    help(LinearDiffuser)
    help(dfn)
    LinearDiffuser?
    dfn?

Quit interactive help in iPython by pressing "q".


.. _input_files:

Inputs to components
--------------------
Landlab components are initialized by passing a copy of the grid, then by
passing additional dynamic Python keyword arguments, almost all of which are
set to default values if a value is not provided. This means all of the ways
that you could call any other Python function using keywords also applies to
our components.

Most simply, components can be initialized by passing only the keyword values
that need to deviate from the defaults. So, for example, the default parameter
values for the `FastscapeEroder` are
`K_sp=None, m_sp=0.5, n_sp=1., threshold_sp=0., rainfall_intensity=1.`. So if
I want to set the `K_sp` to, say, `1.e-6`, but I am happy with these other
parameters, I can simply do:

.. code-block:: python

    fsc = FastscapeEroder(grid, K_sp=1.e-6)

Because Landlab components make use of Python's native `**kwargs` argument
syntax, we can also pass multiple keywords at once to a component using a
Python dictionary:

.. code-block:: python

    sp_thresholds = grid.add_ones('node', 'sp_thresholds')
    myargs = {'K_sp': 1.e-5, 'rainfall_intensity': 0.5, 'threshold_sp': sp_thresholds}
    fsc = FastscapeEroder(grid, **myargs)

Note the "magic" `**` decorator that is placed on the dictionary when it is
passed to the component that makes this work. Also note that we can allow the
component default values to continue to set any keywords we still don't want to
supply, and that as long as the component permits it, we can pass in arrays or
field names like this too (see, e.g., `threshold_sp` above). You can have all
of your input parameters for all components in one dictionary if you so wish;
components will ignore any keywords they are passed that they don't recognize.

**Note that Landlab components will raise an error if they are passed
keyword arguments that they do not need.**

Landlab components always want to see a Python dictionary as their input, as
illustrated above. However, Landlab does offer a native file
reader called `load_params` that allows you to create dictionaries to pass to
components from input files. This function recognizes both
`"yaml" <https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/>`_ formatted data files, e.g.,

.. code-block:: yaml

    K_sp: 0.3
    m_sp: 0.5
    n_sp: 1.
    linear_diffusivity: 0.0001

The `load_params` method will figure out which to use by itself, and will do
any necessary typecasting automatically (i.e., floats will be floats, not
strings):

.. code-block:: python

    from landlab import load_params
    my_input_dict = load_params('./mytextinputfile.txt')
    dfn = FastscapeEroder(grid, **my_input_dict)

Component standard properties
-----------------------------

All Landlab components offer a standardized interface. This provides automated information
on the fields, units, etc. that the component works with, creates, and/or modifies. For a
fully compliant component, you will find you can call the following methods and attributes.

See :ref:`the tutorials <tutorials>` for
examples of use cases with one, two, and more coupled components.

You can also get an overview of field usage by all components through Landlab's
command line interface. See
:ref:`here <getting_info_about_fields>`
for more information.

.. _component_standard_names:

Landlab standard naming conventions
-----------------------------------

The Landlab component library attempts to make use of a relatively standardized set of names across
the various components, in order to maximize ease of component coupling. If you're familiar with
the concept of the `CSDMS standard naming conventions
<https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/CSDMS_Standard_Names>`_, note that we have tried to strike a balance
between the rigor and uniqueness of those names and a more user-friendly, succinct approach.
Nonetheless, you may recognize the basic style of the names:

	**thing_described__what_is_described**

e.g., *topographic__elevation*, *water_surface__gradient*, *water__volume_flux*

We compile two tables to assist users with the Landlab standard names.

- First is :ref:`a list of all names with their definitions
  <standard_name_definitions>`.
- Second is :ref:`a table listing which components create and use each field
  <standard_name_mapping>`.

See :ref:`here <standard_name_changes>` for a list of changes to the standard
name list associated with the release of Landlab version 1.x (relative to 0.x).


Dealing with nonstandard names
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The large number of developers on Landlab and historical accident have meant that despite our
best efforts you'll inevitably find instances where different components use different names
for the same thing. In these cases, you need to make equivalent two fields in the grid which
have different names so that two components can talk to each other. This is actually easy;
you can just do:

>>> mg.add_field('node', 'second_name', mg.at_node['first_name'])

Note that we are making slow progress towards truly standardizing the component library, but
these kind of idiosyncrasies might yet persist for a while!
.. _standard_name_changes:

Changes to standard names from Landlab 0.x to 1.x
=================================================

As part of our push to version 1 of Landlab, the standard names have been overhauled to enhance
internal consistency. Most of this work happened before our beta launch at the CSDMS meeting, so
should not cause too many problems. However, if in doubt interrogate the most current input and
output names for the component you're currently using with `[component].input_var_names` and
`[component].output_var_names`.

However, a few standard names have had to change since the version 1 beta. To our best knowledge
most of these were not widely used or public-facing. The list is as follows::

    'water__discharge' is now 'surface_water__discharge'
    'water__depth' is now 'surface_water__depth'
    'unit_flux' is now 'hillslope_sediment__unit_volume_flux'
    'lithosphere__vertical_displacement' is now 'lithosphere_surface__elevation_increment'
    'rainfall__daily' is now 'rainfall__daily_depth'

Of these, `'water__depth'` is most likely to impact people, as it formed an input to the
`StreamPowerEroder`. However, for back compatibility, you should still find that that component
is still able to handle both the old and new names.
.. _one_to_two:

Transition from Landlab 1.x to 2.0
==================================

Landlab 2.0 will be released in early 2020. This page is meant to summarize the
major changes in Landlab 2.0 and make it easier for you to transition your
code.

Changes include:

- Landlab now requires Python 3 and no longer supports Python 2.
- The Landlab grid now inherits from the Landlab graph.
- Some grid methods have been removed.
- Standardization of the component interface.
- Some other functions/methods have been removed.
- No more GitHub Wiki, all the docs are on this page.

These are described in more detail below.

No more Python 2
----------------

TODO: put a link to general 2 to 3 resources

Landlab grid now inherits from the Landlab graph
------------------------------------------------

TODO List of user-facing changes

Deprecation of some grid methods
--------------------------------

TODO List of these, including replacements if any.

Changes to field creation
-------------------------

TODO Describe these better.

- no more `noclobber`, instead we have `clobber`
- recommended field init (eg. at="")

Changes to Boundary Condition Flags
-----------------------------------

- Landlab no longer exposes unbound flags for boundary conditions. Instead
  these flags are bound to the grid object. So to close the node with ID 1,
  instead of

  .. code-block:: python

      from landlab import CLOSED_NODE, RasterModelGrid
      grid = RasterModelGrid((10, 5))
      grid.status_at_node[0] = CLOSED_NODE

  now we use the bound attribute `Grid.BC_NODE_IS_CLOSED`.

  .. code-block:: python

      from landlab import RasterModelGrid
      grid = RasterModelGrid((10, 5))
      grid.status_at_node[0] = grid.BC_NODE_IS_CLOSED

A complete mapping is found in this table.

+-------------------------+-------------------------------------+


Standardization and deprecation within the component library
------------------------------------------------------------

TODO: Finish and write more.

- FlowRouter deprecated. Use FlowAccumulator
- No more flooded_nodes (use ``erode_flooded_nodes=True`` at init)
- Fewer different options for runoff rate, but one, consistent, good option
  (use argument to FlowAccumulator, then use ``surface__water_discharge`` for
  erosion).
- Removal of old deprecated methods such as (``erode``, ``diffuse``)
- Main method now either take ``dt`` or nothing.

Some other functions/methods have been removed

===================
VoronoiDelaunayGrid
===================

General class methods and attributes of the `landlab.grid.voronoi` module
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Landlab's unstructured, irregular grids are implemented by the class
`VoronoiDelaunayGrid`, which inherits from `ModelGrid`. This text lists
grid methods available for the class:

Getting Information about a Grid
--------------------------------
The following attributes, properties, and methods provide data about the grid,
its geometry, and the connectivity among the various elements. Each grid
element has an ID number, which is also its position in an array that
contains information about that type of element. For example, the *x*
coordinate of node 5 would be found at `grid.node_x[5]`.

The naming of grid-element arrays is *attribute*`_at_`*element*, where
*attribute* is the name of the data in question, and *element* is the element
to which the attribute applies. For example, the property `node_at_cell`
contains the ID of the node associated with each cell. For example,
`node_at_cell[3]` contains the *node ID* of the node associated with cell 3.
The *attribute* is singular if there is only one value per element; for
example, there is only one node associated with each cell. It is plural when
there are multiple values per element; for example, the `faces_at_cell` array
contains multiple faces for each cell. Exceptions to these general rules are
functions that return indices of a subset of all elements of a particular type.
For example, you can obtain an array with IDs of only the core nodes using
`core_nodes`, while `active_links` provides an array of IDs of active links
(only). Finally, attributes that represent a measurement of something, such as
the length of a link or the surface area of a cell, are described using `_of_`,
as in the example `area_of_cell`.

Data Fields in ModelGrid
------------------------
:class:`~.ModelGrid` inherits from the :class:`~.GraphFields` class. This
provides `~.ModelGrid`, and its subclasses, with the ability to, optionally,
store data values that are associated with the different types grid elements
(nodes, cells, etc.). In particular, as part of ``ModelGrid.__init__()``,
data field *groups* are added to the `ModelGrid` that provide containers to
put data fields into. There is one group for each of the eight grid elements
(node, cell, link, face, core_node, core_cell, active_link, and active_face).

To access these groups, use the same methods as accessing groups with
`~.GraphFields`. ``ModelGrid.__init__()`` adds the following attributes to
itself that provide access to the values groups:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.grid.voronoi.VoronoiDelaunayGrid.at_node
    ~landlab.grid.voronoi.VoronoiDelaunayGrid.at_cell
    ~landlab.grid.voronoi.VoronoiDelaunayGrid.at_link
    ~landlab.grid.voronoi.VoronoiDelaunayGrid.at_face
    ~landlab.grid.voronoi.VoronoiDelaunayGrid.at_patch
    ~landlab.grid.voronoi.VoronoiDelaunayGrid.at_corner

Each of these attributes returns a ``dict``-like object whose keys are value
names as strings and values are numpy arrays that gives quantities at
grid elements.


Create Field Arrays
+++++++++++++++++++
:class:`~.ModelGrid` inherits several useful methods for creating new data
fields and adding new data fields to a ModelGrid instance. Methods to add or
create a new data array follow the ``numpy`` syntax for creating arrays. The
folowing methods create and, optionally, initialize new arrays. These arrays
are of the correct size but a new field will not be added to the field:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.empty
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.ones
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.zeros

Add Fields to a ModelGrid
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Unlike with the equivalent numpy functions, these do not take a size argument
as the size of the returned arrays is determined from the size of the
ModelGrid. However, the keyword arguments are the same as those of the numpy
equivalents.

The following methods will create a new array and add a reference to that
array to the ModelGrid:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.grid.voronoi.VoronoiDelaunayGrid.add_empty
    ~landlab.grid.voronoi.VoronoiDelaunayGrid.add_field
    ~landlab.grid.voronoi.VoronoiDelaunayGrid.add_ones
    ~landlab.grid.voronoi.VoronoiDelaunayGrid.add_zeros
    ~landlab.grid.voronoi.VoronoiDelaunayGrid.delete_field

These methods operate in the same way as the previous set except that, in
addition to creating a new array, the newly-created array is added to the
ModelGrid. The calling signature is the same but with the addition of an
argument that gives the name of the new field as a string. The additional
method, :meth:`~.GraphFields.add_field`, adds a previously allocation
array to the ModelGrid. If the array is of the incorrect size it will raise
``ValueError``.

Query Fields
++++++++++++
Use the following methods/attributes get information about the stored data
fields:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.size
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.keys
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.has_group
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.has_field
    ~landlab.grid.voronoi.VoronoiDelaunayGrid.field_units
    ~landlab.grid.voronoi.VoronoiDelaunayGrid.field_values
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.groups

i.e., call, e.g. mg.has_field('node', 'my_field_name')

Gradients, fluxes, and divergences on the grid
----------------------------------------------

Landlab is designed to easily calculate gradients in quantities across the
grid, and to construct fluxes and flux divergences from them. Because these
calculations tend to be a little more involved than property lookups, the
methods tend to start with `calc_`.

.. currentmodule:: landlab 

.. autosummary::

    ~landlab.grid.voronoi.VoronoiDelaunayGrid.calc_diff_at_link

    ~landlab.grid.voronoi.VoronoiDelaunayGrid.calc_unit_normal_at_patch

Mappers
-------

These methods allow mapping of values defined on one grid element type onto a
second, e.g., mapping upwind node values onto links, or mean link values onto
nodes.

Notes
-----
It is important that when creating a new grid class that inherits from
``ModelGrid``, to call ``ModelGrid.__init__()`` in the new grid's
``__init__()``. For example, the new class's __init__ should contain the
following code,

.. code-block:: python

    class NewGrid(ModelGrid):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwds):
            ModelGrid.__init__(self, **kwds)
            # Code that initializes the NewGrid

Without this, the new grid class will not have the ``at_*`` attributes.

General class methods and attributes of the `landlab.grid.network` module
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Landlab's network grids are implemented by the class `NetworkModelGrid`,
which inherits from `Graph` and `GraphFields`. This text lists grid methods
available for the class:

Getting Information about a Grid
--------------------------------
The following attributes, properties, and methods provide data about a
NetworkModelGrid, its geometry, and the connectivity among the various elements.
Each grid element has an ID number, which is also its position in an array that
contains information about that type of element. For example, the *x*
coordinate of node 5 would be found at `grid.node_x[5]`.

The naming of grid-element arrays is *attribute*`_at_`*element*, where
*attribute* is the name of the data in question, and *element* is the element
to which the attribute applies. For example, the property `nodes_at_link`
contains the ID of the nodes associated with each link. For example,
`nodes_at_link[3]` contains the *node ID* of the node associated with link 3.
The *attribute* is singular if there is only one value per element; for
example, there are two nodes associated with each link. It is plural when
there are multiple values per element. Exceptions to these general rules are
functions that return indices of a subset of all elements of a particular type.
For example, you can obtain an array with IDs of only the core nodes using
`core_nodes`, while `active_links` provides an array of IDs of active links
(only). Finally, attributes that represent a measurement of something, such as
the length of a link or the surface area of a cell, are described using `_of_`,
as in the example `area_of_cell`.

    ~landlab.grid.network.NetworkModelGrid.x_of_link
    ~landlab.grid.network.NetworkModelGrid.y_of_link

Data Fields in ModelGrid
------------------------
:class:`~.ModelGrid` inherits from the :class:`~.GraphFields` class. This
provides `~.ModelGrid`, and its subclasses, with the ability to, optionally,
store data values that are associated with the different types grid elements
(nodes, cells, etc.). In particular, as part of ``GraphFields.__init__()``,
data field *groups* are added to the `GraphFields` that provide containers to
put data fields into. There is one group for each of the two grid elements
(node and link).

To access these groups, use the same methods as accessing groups with
`~.GraphFields`. ``GraphFields.__init__()`` adds the following attributes to
itself that provide access to the values groups:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.grid.network.NetworkModelGrid.at_node
    ~landlab.grid.network.NetworkModelGrid.at_link

Each of these attributes returns a ``dict``-like object whose keys are value
names as strings and values are numpy arrays that gives quantities at
grid elements.


Create Field Arrays
+++++++++++++++++++
:class:`~.ModelGrid` inherits several useful methods for creating new data
fields and adding new data fields to a ModelGrid instance. Methods to add or
create a new data array follow the ``numpy`` syntax for creating arrays. The
folowing methods create and, optionally, initialize new arrays. These arrays
are of the correct size but a new field will not be added to the field:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.empty
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.ones
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.zeros

Add Fields to a ModelGrid
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Unlike with the equivalent numpy functions, these do not take a size argument
as the size of the returned arrays is determined from the size of the
ModelGrid. However, the keyword arguments are the same as those of the numpy
equivalents.

The following methods will create a new array and add a reference to that
array to the ModelGrid:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.add_empty
    ~landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.add_field
    ~landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.add_ones
    ~landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.add_zeros
    ~landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.delete_field

These methods operate in the same way as the previous set except that, in
addition to creating a new array, the newly-created array is added to the
ModelGrid. The calling signature is the same but with the addition of an
argument that gives the name of the new field as a string. The additional
method, :meth:`~.GraphFields.add_field`, adds a previously allocation
array to the ModelGrid. If the array is of the incorrect size it will raise
``ValueError``.

Query Fields
++++++++++++
Use the following methods/attributes get information about the stored data
fields:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.size
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.keys
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.has_group
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.has_field
    ~landlab.grid.network.NetworkModelGrid.field_units
    ~landlab.grid.network.NetworkModelGrid.field_values
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.groups

i.e., call, e.g. mg.has_field('node', 'my_field_name')

Gradients, fluxes, and divergences on the grid
----------------------------------------------

Landlab is designed to easily calculate gradients in quantities across the
grid, and to construct fluxes and flux divergences from them. Because these
calculations tend to be a little more involved than property lookups, the
methods tend to start with `calc_`.

.. currentmodule:: landlab 

.. autosummary::

    ~landlab.grid.network.NetworkModelGrid.calc_grad_at_link

Mappers
-------

These methods allow mapping of values defined on one grid element type onto a
second, e.g., mapping upwind node values onto links, or mean link values onto
nodes.

--------------------------

These are the primary properties for getting and setting the grid boundary
conditions. Changes made to :meth:`~.ModelGrid.status_at_node` and
:meth:`~.ModelGrid.status_at_node` will automatically update the conditions
defined at other grid elements automatically.

General class methods and attributes of the `landlab.grid.hex` module
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Landlab's hex/trigonal grids are implemented by the class `HexModelGrid`,
which inherits from `VoronoiDelaunayGrid`. This text lists grid methods
available for the class:

Getting Information about a Grid
--------------------------------
The following attributes, properties, and methods provide data about the grid,
its geometry, and the connectivity among the various elements. Each grid
element has an ID number, which is also its position in an array that
contains information about that type of element. For example, the *x*
coordinate of node 5 would be found at `grid.node_x[5]`.

The naming of grid-element arrays is *attribute*`_at_`*element*, where
*attribute* is the name of the data in question, and *element* is the element
to which the attribute applies. For example, the property `node_at_cell`
contains the ID of the node associated with each cell. For example,
`node_at_cell[3]` contains the *node ID* of the node associated with cell 3.
The *attribute* is singular if there is only one value per element; for
example, there is only one node associated with each cell. It is plural when
there are multiple values per element; for example, the `faces_at_cell` array
contains multiple faces for each cell. Exceptions to these general rules are
functions that return indices of a subset of all elements of a particular type.
For example, you can obtain an array with IDs of only the core nodes using
`core_nodes`, while `active_links` provides an array of IDs of active links
(only). Finally, attributes that represent a measurement of something, such as
the length of a link or the surface area of a cell, are described using `_of_`,
as in the example `area_of_cell`.

Data Fields in ModelGrid
------------------------
:class:`~.ModelGrid` inherits from the :class:`~.GraphFields` class. This
provides `~.ModelGrid`, and its subclasses, with the ability to, optionally,
store data values that are associated with the different types grid elements
(nodes, cells, etc.). In particular, as part of ``ModelGrid.__init__()``,
data field *groups* are added to the `ModelGrid` that provide containers to
put data fields into. There is one group for each of the eight grid elements
(node, cell, link, face, core_node, core_cell, active_link, and active_face).

To access these groups, use the same methods as accessing groups with
`~.GraphFields`. ``ModelGrid.__init__()`` adds the following attributes to
itself that provide access to the values groups:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.grid.hex.HexModelGrid.at_node
    ~landlab.grid.hex.HexModelGrid.at_cell
    ~landlab.grid.hex.HexModelGrid.at_link
    ~landlab.grid.hex.HexModelGrid.at_face
    ~landlab.grid.hex.HexModelGrid.at_patch
    ~landlab.grid.hex.HexModelGrid.at_corner

Each of these attributes returns a ``dict``-like object whose keys are value
names as strings and values are numpy arrays that gives quantities at
grid elements.


Create Field Arrays
+++++++++++++++++++
:class:`~.ModelGrid` inherits several useful methods for creating new data
fields and adding new data fields to a ModelGrid instance. Methods to add or
create a new data array follow the ``numpy`` syntax for creating arrays. The
folowing methods create and, optionally, initialize new arrays. These arrays
are of the correct size but a new field will not be added to the field:

.. autosummary::

    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.empty
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.ones
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.zeros

Add Fields to a ModelGrid
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Unlike with the equivalent numpy functions, these do not take a size argument
as the size of the returned arrays is determined from the size of the
ModelGrid. However, the keyword arguments are the same as those of the numpy
equivalents.

The following methods will create a new array and add a reference to that
array to the ModelGrid:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.grid.hex.HexModelGrid.add_empty
    ~landlab.grid.hex.HexModelGrid.add_field
    ~landlab.grid.hex.HexModelGrid.add_ones
    ~landlab.grid.hex.HexModelGrid.add_zeros
    ~landlab.grid.hex.HexModelGrid.delete_field

These methods operate in the same way as the previous set except that, in
addition to creating a new array, the newly-created array is added to the
ModelGrid. The calling signature is the same but with the addition of an
argument that gives the name of the new field as a string. The additional
method, :meth:`~.GraphFields.add_field`, adds a previously allocation
array to the ModelGrid. If the array is of the incorrect size it will raise
``ValueError``.

Query Fields
++++++++++++
Use the following methods/attributes get information about the stored data
fields:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.size
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.keys

    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.groups

i.e., call, e.g. mg.has_field('node', 'my_field_name')

Gradients, fluxes, and divergences on the grid
----------------------------------------------

Landlab is designed to easily calculate gradients in quantities across the
grid, and to construct fluxes and flux divergences from them. Because these
calculations tend to be a little more involved than property lookups, the
methods tend to start with `calc_`.

.. currentmodule:: landlab

Mappers
-------

These methods allow mapping of values defined on one grid element type onto a
second, e.g., mapping upwind node values onto links, or mean link values onto
nodes.

Boundary condition control
--------------------------

These are the primary properties for getting and setting the grid boundary
conditions. Changes made to :meth:`~.ModelGrid.status_at_node` and
:meth:`~.ModelGrid.status_at_node` will automatically update the conditions
defined at other grid elements automatically.

Identifying node subsets
------------------------

These methods are useful in identifying subsets of nodes, e.g., closest node
to a point; nodes at edges.

(None are available for this grid type)

Surface analysis
----------------

These methods permit the kinds of surface analysis that you might expect to
find in GIS software.

Notes
-----
It is important that when creating a new grid class that inherits from
``ModelGrid``, to call ``ModelGrid.__init__()`` in the new grid's
``__init__()``. For example, the new class's __init__ should contain the
following code,

.. code-block:: python

    class NewGrid(ModelGrid):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwds):
            ModelGrid.__init__(self, **kwds)
            # Code that initializes the NewGrid

Without this, the new grid class will not have the ``at_*`` attributes.

General class methods and attributes of the `landlab.grid.raster` module
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Landlab's regular, raster grids are implemented by the class `RasterModelGrid`,
which inherits from `ModelGrid`. This text lists grid methods available for the
class:

Getting Information about a Grid
--------------------------------
The following attributes, properties, and methods provide data about a
RasterModelGrid, its geometry, and the connectivity among the various elements.
Each grid element has an ID number, which is also its position in an array that
contains information about that type of element. For example, the *x*
coordinate of node 5 would be found at `grid.node_x[5]`.

The naming of grid-element arrays is *attribute*`_at_`*element*, where
*attribute* is the name of the data in question, and *element* is the element
to which the attribute applies. For example, the property `node_at_cell`
contains the ID of the node associated with each cell. For example,
`node_at_cell[3]` contains the *node ID* of the node associated with cell 3.
The *attribute* is singular if there is only one value per element; for
example, there is only one node associated with each cell. It is plural when
there are multiple values per element; for example, the `faces_at_cell` array
contains multiple faces for each cell. Exceptions to these general rules are
functions that return indices of a subset of all elements of a particular type.
For example, you can obtain an array with IDs of only the core nodes using
`core_nodes`, while `active_links` provides an array of IDs of active links
(only). Finally, attributes that represent a measurement of something, such as
the length of a link or the surface area of a cell, are described using `_of_`,
as in the example `area_of_cell`.

Data Fields in ModelGrid
------------------------
:class:`~.ModelGrid` inherits from the :class:`~.GraphFields` class. This
provides `~.ModelGrid`, and its subclasses, with the ability to, optionally,
store data values that are associated with the different types grid elements
(nodes, cells, etc.). In particular, as part of ``ModelGrid.__init__()``,
data field *groups* are added to the `ModelGrid` that provide containers to
put data fields into. There is one group for each of the eight grid elements
(node, cell, link, face, core_node, core_cell, active_link, and active_face).

To access these groups, use the same methods as accessing groups with
`~.GraphFields`. ``ModelGrid.__init__()`` adds the following attributes to
itself that provide access to the values groups:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.at_node
    ~landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.at_cell
    ~landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.at_link
    ~landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.at_face
    ~landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.at_patch
    ~landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.at_corner

Each of these attributes returns a ``dict``-like object whose keys are value
names as strings and values are numpy arrays that gives quantities at
grid elements.


Create Field Arrays
+++++++++++++++++++
:class:`~.ModelGrid` inherits several useful methods for creating new data
fields and adding new data fields to a ModelGrid instance. Methods to add or
create a new data array follow the ``numpy`` syntax for creating arrays. The
folowing methods create and, optionally, initialize new arrays. These arrays
are of the correct size but a new field will not be added to the field:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.empty
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.ones
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.zeros

Add Fields to a ModelGrid
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Unlike with the equivalent numpy functions, these do not take a size argument
as the size of the returned arrays is determined from the size of the
ModelGrid. However, the keyword arguments are the same as those of the numpy
equivalents.

The following methods will create a new array and add a reference to that
array to the ModelGrid:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.add_empty
    ~landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.add_field
    ~landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.add_ones
    ~landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.add_zeros
    ~landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.delete_field

These methods operate in the same way as the previous set except that, in
addition to creating a new array, the newly-created array is added to the
ModelGrid. The calling signature is the same but with the addition of an
argument that gives the name of the new field as a string. The additional
method, :meth:`~.GraphFields.add_field`, adds a previously allocation
array to the ModelGrid. If the array is of the incorrect size it will raise
``ValueError``.

Query Fields
++++++++++++
Use the following methods/attributes get information about the stored data
fields:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.size
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.keys
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.has_group
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.has_field
    ~landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.field_units
    ~landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.field_values
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.groups

i.e., call, e.g. mg.has_field('node', 'my_field_name')

Gradients, fluxes, and divergences on the grid
----------------------------------------------

Landlab is designed to easily calculate gradients in quantities across the
grid, and to construct fluxes and flux divergences from them. Because these
calculations tend to be a little more involved than property lookups, the
methods tend to start with `calc_`.

nodes.

to a point; nodes at edges.

Notes
-----
It is important that when creating a new grid class that inherits from
``ModelGrid``, to call ``ModelGrid.__init__()`` in the new grid's
``__init__()``. For example, the new class's __init__ should contain the
following code,

.. code-block:: python

    class NewGrid(ModelGrid):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwds):
            ModelGrid.__init__(self, **kwds)
            # Code that initializes the NewGrid

Without this, the new grid class will not have the ``at_*`` attributes.

General class methods and attributes of the `landlab.grid.base` module
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This describes Landlab's implementation of ModelGrid, a base class used to
create and manage grids for 2D numerical models in Python using Landlab.
This text lists grid methods available for the class:

Getting Information about a Grid
--------------------------------
The following attributes, properties, and methods provide data about the grid,
its geometry, and the connectivity among the various elements. Each grid
element has an ID number, which is also its position in an array that
contains information about that type of element. For example, the *x*
coordinate of node 5 would be found at `grid.node_x[5]`.

The naming of grid-element arrays is *attribute*`_at_`*element*, where
*attribute* is the name of the data in question, and *element* is the element
to which the attribute applies. For example, the property `node_at_cell`
contains the ID of the node associated with each cell. For example,
`node_at_cell[3]` contains the *node ID* of the node associated with cell 3.
The *attribute* is singular if there is only one value per element; for
example, there is only one node associated with each cell. It is plural when
there are multiple values per element; for example, the `faces_at_cell` array
contains multiple faces for each cell. Exceptions to these general rules are
functions that return indices of a subset of all elements of a particular type.
For example, you can obtain an array with IDs of only the core nodes using
`core_nodes`, while `active_links` provides an array of IDs of active links
(only). Finally, attributes that represent a measurement of something, such as
the length of a link or the surface area of a cell, are described using `_of_`,
as in the example `area_of_cell`.

(None are available for this grid type)


Data Fields in ModelGrid
------------------------
:class:`~.ModelGrid` inherits from the :class:`~.GraphFields` class. This
provides `~.ModelGrid`, and its subclasses, with the ability to, optionally,
store data values that are associated with the different types grid elements
(nodes, cells, etc.). In particular, as part of ``ModelGrid.__init__()``,
data field *groups* are added to the `ModelGrid` that provide containers to
put data fields into. There is one group for each of the eight grid elements
(node, cell, link, face, core_node, core_cell, active_link, and active_face).
There is an additional group at_grid that can store arrays of length one
intended as a place to store variables global to the grid.

To access these groups, use the same methods as accessing groups with
`~.GraphFields`. ``ModelGrid.__init__()`` adds the following attributes to
itself that provide access to the values groups:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.at_node
    ~landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.at_cell
    ~landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.at_link
    ~landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.at_face
    ~landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.at_patch
    ~landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.at_corner
    ~landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.at_grid

Each of these attributes returns a ``dict``-like object whose keys are value
names as strings and values are numpy arrays that gives quantities at
grid elements.


Create Field Arrays
+++++++++++++++++++
:class:`~.ModelGrid` inherits several useful methods for creating new data
fields and adding new data fields to a ModelGrid instance. Methods to add or
create a new data array follow the ``numpy`` syntax for creating arrays. The
folowing methods create and, optionally, initialize new arrays. These arrays
are of the correct size but a new field will not be added to the field:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.empty
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.ones
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.zeros

Add Fields to a ModelGrid
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Unlike with the equivalent numpy functions, these do not take a size argument
as the size of the returned arrays is determined from the size of the
ModelGrid. However, the keyword arguments are the same as those of the numpy
equivalents.

The following methods will create a new array and add a reference to that
array to the ModelGrid:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.add_empty
    ~landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.add_field
    ~landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.add_ones
    ~landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.add_zeros
    ~landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.delete_field

These methods operate in the same way as the previous set except that, in
addition to creating a new array, the newly-created array is added to the
ModelGrid. The calling signature is the same but with the addition of an
argument that gives the name of the new field as a string. The additional
method, :meth:`~.GraphFields.add_field`, adds a previously allocation
array to the ModelGrid. If the array is of the incorrect size it will raise
``ValueError``.

Query Fields
++++++++++++
Use the following methods/attributes get information about the stored data
fields:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.size
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.keys
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.has_group
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.has_field
    ~landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.field_units
    ~landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.field_values
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.groups

i.e., call, e.g. mg.has_field('node', 'my_field_name')

Gradients, fluxes, and divergences on the grid
----------------------------------------------

Landlab is designed to easily calculate gradients in quantities across the
grid, and to construct fluxes and flux divergences from them. Because these
calculations tend to be a little more involved than property lookups, the
methods tend to start with `calc_`.

find in GIS software.

    ~landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.calc_slope_at_node

Notes
-----
It is important that when creating a new grid class that inherits from
``ModelGrid``, to call ``ModelGrid.__init__()`` in the new grid's
``__init__()``. For example, the new class's __init__ should contain the
following code,

.. code-block:: python

    class NewGrid(ModelGrid):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwds):
            ModelGrid.__init__(self, **kwds)
            # Code that initializes the NewGrid

Without this, the new grid class will not have the ``at_*`` attributes.

Examples
--------
Although the following examples use a :class:`~.RasterModelGrid`, they apply
equally to any grid that inherits from :class:`~.ModelGrid`.  The new grid
comes with a set of pre-defined value groups. One group for each grid element.
Use the groups attribute to see the group names.

>>> from landlab import RasterModelGrid
>>> grid = RasterModelGrid((3, 3))
>>> groups = list(grid.groups)
>>> groups.sort()
>>> groups
['cell', 'corner', 'face', 'grid', 'link', 'node', 'patch']

Create Field Arrays
+++++++++++++++++++
If you just want to create an array but not add it to the grid, you can use
the :meth:`~.ModelGrid.ones` method.

>>> grid.ones(at='node')
array([ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.])
>>> list(grid.at_node.keys()) # Nothing has been added to the grid
[]

Add Field Arrays
++++++++++++++++
Use the ``add_*`` methods to add value arrays attached to grid elements. Each
of these methods accepts two arguments. The first is name of the grid element
where values are associated and the second the name of the quantity. The
quantity name must be unique within a group but the same quantity can appear
in multiple goups.

>>> list(grid.at_node.keys()) # There a no values defined at grid nodes
[]
>>> z = grid.add_ones('node', 'topographic__elevation')

We now see that the array has been added to the grid as a reference to the
array returned by ``add_ones``.

>>> list(grid.at_node.keys())
['topographic__elevation']
>>> grid.at_node['topographic__elevation']
array([ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.])
>>> z is grid.at_node['topographic__elevation']
True

To add a previously created array to the grid, use the

Grid types
----------

Landlab presently supports five types of grids. The base class is ``ModelGrid``
with subclasses ``RasterModelGrid`` and ``VoronoiDelaunayGrid``.
``VoronoiDelaunayGrid`` has two further specialized subclasses: ``HexModelGrid``
and ``RadialModelGrid``. A final class is ``NetworkModelGrid``.

The following is an introduction to their properties and methods:

General class methods and attributes of the `landlab.grid.radial` module
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Landlab's radial grids are implemented by the class `RadialModelGrid`,
which inherits from `VoronoiDelaunayGrid`. This text lists grid methods
available for the class:

Getting Information about a Grid
--------------------------------
The following attributes, properties, and methods provide data about the grid,
its geometry, and the connectivity among the various elements. Each grid
element has an ID number, which is also its position in an array that
contains information about that type of element. For example, the *x*
coordinate of node 5 would be found at `grid.node_x[5]`.

The naming of grid-element arrays is *attribute*`_at_`*element*, where
*attribute* is the name of the data in question, and *element* is the element
to which the attribute applies. For example, the property `node_at_cell`
contains the ID of the node associated with each cell. For example,
`node_at_cell[3]` contains the *node ID* of the node associated with cell 3.
The *attribute* is singular if there is only one value per element; for
example, there is only one node associated with each cell. It is plural when
there are multiple values per element; for example, the `faces_at_cell` array
contains multiple faces for each cell. Exceptions to these general rules are
functions that return indices of a subset of all elements of a particular type.
For example, you can obtain an array with IDs of only the core nodes using
`core_nodes`, while `active_links` provides an array of IDs of active links
(only). Finally, attributes that represent a measurement of something, such as
the length of a link or the surface area of a cell, are described using `_of_`,
as in the example `area_of_cell`.

(None are available for this grid type)

Data Fields in ModelGrid
------------------------
:class:`~.ModelGrid` inherits from the :class:`~.GraphFields` class. This
provides `~.ModelGrid`, and its subclasses, with the ability to, optionally,
store data values that are associated with the different types grid elements
(nodes, cells, etc.). In particular, as part of ``ModelGrid.__init__()``,
data field *groups* are added to the `ModelGrid` that provide containers to
put data fields into. There is one group for each of the eight grid elements
(node, cell, link, face, core_node, core_cell, active_link, and active_face).

To access these groups, use the same methods as accessing groups with
`~.GraphFields`. ``ModelGrid.__init__()`` adds the following attributes to
itself that provide access to the values groups:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.at_node
    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.at_cell
    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.at_link
    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.at_face
    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.at_patch
    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.at_corner

Each of these attributes returns a ``dict``-like object whose keys are value
names as strings and values are numpy arrays that gives quantities at
grid elements.


Create Field Arrays
+++++++++++++++++++
:class:`~.ModelGrid` inherits several useful methods for creating new data
fields and adding new data fields to a ModelGrid instance. Methods to add or
create a new data array follow the ``numpy`` syntax for creating arrays. The
folowing methods create and, optionally, initialize new arrays. These arrays
are of the correct size but a new field will not be added to the field:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.empty
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.ones
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.zeros

Add Fields to a ModelGrid
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Unlike with the equivalent numpy functions, these do not take a size argument
as the size of the returned arrays is determined from the size of the
ModelGrid. However, the keyword arguments are the same as those of the numpy
equivalents.

The following methods will create a new array and add a reference to that
array to the ModelGrid:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.add_empty
    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.add_field
    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.add_ones
    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.add_zeros
    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.delete_field

These methods operate in the same way as the previous set except that, in
addition to creating a new array, the newly-created array is added to the
ModelGrid. The calling signature is the same but with the addition of an
argument that gives the name of the new field as a string. The additional
method, :meth:`~.GraphFields.add_field`, adds a previously allocation
array to the ModelGrid. If the array is of the incorrect size it will raise
``ValueError``.

Query Fields
++++++++++++
Use the following methods/attributes get information about the stored data
fields:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.size
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.keys
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.has_group
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.has_field
    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.field_units
    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.field_values
    ~landlab.field.graph_field.GraphFields.groups

i.e., call, e.g. mg.has_field('node', 'my_field_name')

Gradients, fluxes, and divergences on the grid
----------------------------------------------

Landlab is designed to easily calculate gradients in quantities across the
grid, and to construct fluxes and flux divergences from them. Because these
calculations tend to be a little more involved than property lookups, the
methods tend to start with `calc_`.

.. currentmodule:: landlab 

.. autosummary::

    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.calc_diff_at_link
    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.calc_flux_div_at_cell

    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.calc_grad_at_link
    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.calc_grad_at_patch
    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.calc_net_flux_at_node

    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.calc_slope_at_patch
    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.calc_unit_normal_at_patch

Mappers
-------

These methods allow mapping of values defined on one grid element type onto a
second, e.g., mapping upwind node values onto links, or mean link values onto
nodes.

.. currentmodule:: landlab 

.. autosummary::

    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.map_downwind_node_link_max_to_node

    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.map_value_at_min_node_to_link
    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.map_value_at_upwind_node_link_max_to_node

Boundary condition control
--------------------------

These are the primary properties for getting and setting the grid boundary
conditions. Changes made to :meth:`~.ModelGrid.status_at_node` and
:meth:`~.ModelGrid.status_at_node` will automatically update the conditions
defined at other grid elements automatically.

    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.status_at_link
    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.status_at_node

Identifying node subsets
------------------------

These methods are useful in identifying subsets of nodes, e.g., closest node
to a point; nodes at edges.

.. currentmodule:: landlab

Surface analysis
----------------

These methods permit the kinds of surface analysis that you might expect to
find in GIS software.

.. autosummary::

    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.calc_aspect_at_node
    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.calc_hillshade_at_node
    ~landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid.calc_slope_at_node

Notes
-----
It is important that when creating a new grid class that inherits from
``ModelGrid``, to call ``ModelGrid.__init__()`` in the new grid's
``__init__()``. For example, the new class's __init__ should contain the
following code,

.. code-block:: python

    class NewGrid(ModelGrid):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwds):
            ModelGrid.__init__(self, **kwds)
            # Code that initializes the NewGrid

Without this, the new grid class will not have the ``at_*`` attributes.

======
Layers
======

Landlab has the ability to add layers to the grid. Two types of layers are
currently supported. First is EventLayers in which each event is preserved as
an entry into the datastructure, even if no deposition occurs. If you are
interested in chronostratigraphy, this is probably what you are interested in.
Second is MaterialLayers, in which each layer must contain some material.
If an entire layer is eroded in MaterialLayers, the layer is removed.
MaterialLayers will likely use less memory than EventLayers.

Theory and Implementation of GroundwaterDupuitPercolator
========================================================

Governing Equations
===================

Variably-saturated groundwater flow is often assumed to be governed by
the Richards equation, which describes how water content and/or total
energy potential evolve in an idealized porous medium due to fluxes of
water driven by gradients in total potential, :math:`h = z + p/ \gamma`,
where :math:`z` is the elevation head, :math:`p` is the gage pressure,
and :math:`\gamma` is the specific weight of water.

.. math:: \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \bigg( k \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} \bigg) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \bigg( k \frac{\partial h}{\partial y} \bigg) + \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \bigg( k \frac{\partial h}{\partial z} \bigg)

Here :math:`\theta` is the volumetric water content of the aquifer and
:math:`k` is the hydraulic conductivity, which may be a function of
:math:`\theta`. Here we use the widely applied Dupuit-Forcheimer
approximation, which is valid when the aquifer is laterally extensive in
comparison to its thickness, and the capillary fringe above the water
table is relatively thin. If this is the case, the component of the
hydraulic gradient normal to the aquifer base can be neglected, and the
water table can be treated as a free surface. Consequently, the total
head is equal to the water table elevation, :math:`h=z`. With these
assumptions, an adjusted governing equation can be written for the time
evolution of the water table elevation:

.. math:: n \frac{\partial h}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \bigg( k_{sat} h \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} \bigg) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \bigg( k_{sat} h \frac{\partial h}{\partial y} \bigg)

where :math:`n` is the drainable porosity, and :math:`k_{sat}` is the
saturated hydraulic conductivity.

.. figure:: images/water_table_schematic.png
   :alt: Aquifer schematic.
   :align: center
   :scale: 50%

   Aquifer schematic showing vertical aquifer thickness :math:`h`, bed-normal
   aquifer thickness :math:`\eta`, and water table elevation :math:`z`.


When the aquifer base is sloping, the governing equations must be adjusted.
Childs (1971) provides the governing equation for the groundwater specific discharge as:

.. math:: q_{x'} = - k_{sat} \eta \frac{\partial z}{\partial x'}

where :math:`x'` is the coordinate parallel to the impermeable base, and :math:`\eta`
is the aquifer thickness perpendicular to the impermeable base ([2]_).
The `GroundwaterDupuitPercolator` treats two additional fluxes that affect
aquifer storage: groundwater return flow to the surface :math:`q_s`, and
recharge from precipitation :math:`f`. Implementations of the Dupuit-Forcheimer
model often encounter numerical instabilities as the water table intersects the
land surface. To alleviate this problem, we use the regularization approach
introduced by Marcais et al. (2017), which smooths the transition between
surface and subsurface flow ([1]_). The complete governing equations in the
base-parallel reference frame :math:`(x',y')` are:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   n \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} &= f \cos(\alpha) - q_s \cos(\alpha) - \nabla' \cdot q \\
   q &= -k_{sat} \eta \big( \nabla' z ) \\
   q_s &= \mathcal{G}_r \bigg( \frac{\eta}{d'} \bigg) \mathcal{R} \big(-\nabla' \cdot q + f \cos(\alpha) \big) \\\end{aligned}

where :math:`\alpha` is the slope angle of aquifer base, and :math:`d'` is the
permeable thickness normal to the aquifer base. The gradient operator
:math:`\nabla'` and divergence operator :math:`\nabla' \cdot` are calculated
with respect to the base-parallel coordinate system. Note that the surface runoff
is the sum of both groundwater return flow and precipitation on saturated area.

The expression for :math:`q_s` utilizes two regularization functions :math:`\mathcal{G}_r` and :math:`\mathcal{R}`:

.. math:: \mathcal{G}_r(r,u) = \exp \bigg( - \frac{1-u}{r} \bigg)

.. math:: \mathcal{R}(u) = u \mathcal{H}(u)

where :math:`r` is a user-specified regularization factor and
:math:`\mathcal{H}(u)` is the Heaviside step function:

.. math::

   \mathcal{H}(u) = \left\{
   \begin{array}{ll}
        0 &  u<0 \\[8pt]
        1 &  u \geq 0
   \end{array}
   \right.

.. figure:: images/GDP_regularization.png
   :alt: Regularization functions
   :align: center
   :scale: 40%

   Regularization functions

To recast the problem in terms of the horizontal coordinate system used by Landlab,
we make the substitutions :math:`\eta = h \cos(\alpha)`, :math:`x = x' \cos(\alpha)`,
and :math:`y = y' \cos(\alpha)`. In the horizontal coordinate system :math:`(x,y)`, the
governing equations are:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   n \frac{\partial h}{\partial t} &= f - q_s - \nabla \cdot q \\
   q &= -k_{sat} \cos^2(\alpha) h \big( \nabla z ) \\
   q_s &= \mathcal{G}_r \bigg( \frac{h}{d} \bigg) \mathcal{R} \big(f - \nabla \cdot q \big) \\\end{aligned}

where :math:`d` is the vertical regolith thickness, and the gradient operator
:math:`\nabla` and divergence operator :math:`\nabla \cdot` are calculated with
respect to the horizontal coordinate system :math:`(x,y)`.

We use an explicit, forward-in-time finite-volume method to solve the
governing equations. In this method, gradients are calculated at links
(between volume centers), and flux divergences are calculated at nodes
(at volume centers). The governing equation with timestep
:math:`\Delta t` is:

.. math:: n \bigg( \frac{h^{t+\Delta t} - h^t}{\Delta t} \bigg) = f^t - q_s^t - \nabla \cdot q^t

Below is a description of the components needed to calculate the right
side of this equation. To calculate the groundwater flux :math:`q`, the
gradients of aquifer base elevation :math:`b` and water table elevation
:math:`z` must be determined. The slope angle of the aquifer base is
calculated from the aquifer base elevation :math:`b`:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
       \alpha_{ij} =& \arctan \big( (\nabla b)_{ij} \big) \\
       \big( \nabla b \big)_{ij} =& \frac{b_{i} - b_{j}}{L_{ij}}\end{aligned}

where the subscripts :math:`i` and :math:`j` indicate the nodes at the
head and tail of the link respectively, and :math:`L_{ij}` is the length
of the link. The gradient :math:`\nabla z` is calculated on link :math:`ij` as:

.. math:: \big( \nabla z \big)_{ij} = \frac{z_{i} - z_{j}}{L_{ij}}

Flux divergence is calculated by summing the fluxes into an out of the
links that connect to a node. The divergence of the groundwater flux is:

.. math:: \big( \nabla \cdot q \big)_i = \frac{1}{A_i} \sum_{j \in S} \delta_{ij} q_{ij} \lambda_{ij}

where :math:`A_i` is the area of node :math:`i`, :math:`S` is the set of
nodes that have links that connect to node :math:`i`, and
:math:`\delta_{ij}` is a function that is equal to +1 if the link points
away from the node (the tail of the link is at node :math:`i`), and
equal to -1 if the link points toward the node (the head of the link is
at node :math:`i`). The groundwater flux on the link is :math:`q_{ij}`
and the width of the face through which :math:`q_{ij}` passes is
:math:`\lambda_{ij}`.

Lithology
---------
Two objects based on the EventLayers object exist to make it easier to deal
with spatially variable lithology and associated properties. The Lithology
components contain information about spatially variable lithology and connect
with the Landlab model grid so that when rock is eroded or advected upward by
rock uplift the values of rock propeties at the topographic surface are updated.

First is the Lithology component which is a generic object for variable
lithology.

Anaconda Install
================

Install Anaconda
----------------

This should work for `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ users
with Windows 7+, Mac OS 10.6+, or
Ubuntu Linux (only the latest version has been tested).

Once you have a
:ref:`full Python distribution on your machine<python_installation>`,
it is vital to
check that it has been successfully set as the default copy of Python on
your system. Open a command prompt (Terminal on a Mac, or Command Prompt
on a PC) and type the lines below (note the `$` indicates that you are on
a command line):

MAC:

.. code-block:: bash

 $ which python
 $ which ipython

WINDOWS:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ where python
    $ where ipython

In each case, both commands should return the same path, and it should
clearly refer to Anaconda. Details will depend on your
operating system but it could look something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    /anaconda/bin/python


If you don't see reference to your newly installed distribution (i.e.,
`/anaconda`), :ref:`click here to resolve the problem<correcting_install_paths>`.

Make sure you have the latest version installed (close anaconda before
doing this):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda update –all

Once the path to both `python` and `ipython` point to your new distribution,
open the Python editor in Anaconda called Spyder.

On the Spyder toolbar, go to `Tools → Open` command prompt to open the
command line.

Alternatively you can open a standard terminal window, such as an xterm
(X11.app) or terminal window (Terminal.app) on a Mac, or a command
prompt on a Windows machine. If you do use a standard terminal and run
into problems, make sure you have
:ref:`resolved your path issues<correcting_install_paths>`.

.. _anaconda_install_landlab:

Now to install Landlab!
-----------------------

You can either install with the conda or the pip package managers. Conda
is recommended, as it reduces the chances of versioning conflicts. Try
to remember which you choose to avoid confusion when updating later! (If
you installed landlab prior to May 19th 2016, you will have used pip).

Type either (for conda install):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install landlab -c landlab -c conda-forge

... or for pip install:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install landlab

.. _test_landlab_install:

Test Landlab install
--------------------

Once Landlab has been successfully installed, on the Python shell line,
check to make sure it is up-to-date (note that those are double
underscores around version; also note that you may need to close and
reopen Anaconda before typing the below commands):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ import landlab
    $ landlab.__version__


The version number should be greater than 1. You can check the version
number of the most recent release `here <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/releases>`_.

Install/Test problems
---------------------

If you are having problems when installing, testing or running Landlab,
please visit our :ref:`Troubleshooting<troubleshooting>` page.
.. _troubleshooting:

Troubleshooting Installation/Testing Problems
=============================================

First, make sure you:
---------------------

-  Follow the installation instructions that match your use of Landlab:

   -  :ref:`Install Landlab using Anaconda <anaconda_install>`
      if you are just going to **use** Landlab
   -  :ref:`Install from source code <developer_install>`
      if you are going to **modify** Landlab's source code

-  Follow the instructions relating to the system you are using
   (Mac/Linux or Windows)
-  Install the correct dependencies if you are doing the Developer
   install: they are listed in the `environment_dev.yml` file and you should
   point to this file when :ref:`installing <developer_install>`)
-  Make Anaconda your default Python (when installing Anaconda, or
   :ref:`edit paths afterwards <correcting_install_paths>`).

Try the following commands

On Mac:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ which python
  $ which ipython

On Windows:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ where python
  $ where ipython

python and ipython should show the same path and clearly refer to
Anaconda, looking something like ``/anaconda/bin/python`` \* Update:
Python, Landlab...


MOST COMMON ISSUES:
-------------------

1. Landlab install fails
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Specifications / dependencies conflicts:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Symptoms: when launching the install an error message shows something
   like

``Solving environment: failed``

``UnsatisfiableError: The following specifications were found to be in conflict:...``

-  Possible fix: create and work in a `conda
   environment <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_

-  Related issues:
   `#625 <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues/625>`_,
   `#631 <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues/631>`_,
   `#635 <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues/635>`_

Issues with PATH configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Symptoms: command not found, conda not found, landlab not found,…
-  Fix: :ref:`Correcting your install
   paths <correcting_install_paths>`
-  Related issues:
   `#537 <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues/537>`_ (Windows),
   `#538 <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues/538>`_ (Mac),
   `#589 <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues/589>`_ (Windows)

Developer version not installing on Windows with Python 3.6.5
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Symptoms: Installation fails and requires Visual C++ tools to be
   installed
-  Fix: see Issues
   `#768 <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues/768>`_\ and
   `#773 <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues/773>`_

Landlab for Linux 32-bit (Issue `#617 <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues/617>`_):
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sorry, Landlab is not available (yet) for Linux 32-bit!

2. Landlab runs fail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To test your install, use a command prompt, navigate to your landlab
directory and type:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ conda install pytest
  $ pytest

This tests whatever version of landlab you have installed. If this
produces errors for which you cannot find a fix in this page, please
contact the development team by `creating a GitHub
issue <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues>`_. Provide the
results of the above test and all the information you can (operating
system, type of install you have done, etc.)

AttributeError
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Symptoms: Test fails with:

.. code-block:: python

  AttributeError: 'LandlabTester' object has no attribute 'check_fpu_mode'

-  This is a known error, probably due to numpy version 1.14., to check
   your version:

.. code-block:: python

  import numpy
  numpy.__version__

Although tests currently fail, you should be able to run Landlab
normally, you can ignore this error. \* Similar issues:
`#616 <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues/616>`_,
`#625 <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues/625>`_,
`#630 <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues/630>`_

3. Landlab + Spyder problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spyder does not launch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Symptoms: you cannot launch Spyder or it crashes whenever you try to
   open a file
-  Fix: restart, upgrade, reset… see the `Spyder Troubleshooting
   page <https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Troubleshooting-Guide-and-FAQ>`_.
   Some security/antimalware software have been known to block Spyder
   from launching: try temporarily disabling it or changing your
   settings. On Windows, some launching problems may be due to conflicts
   with other programs that installed the Qt libraries in your computer
   (you can identify them searching for files with the following
   pattern: ``Qt*.dll``): you can either uninstall these programs or
   ``pip install pyqt5``, which should fix the Spyder launching problem.

Import problem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Symptoms: command not found, conda not found, landlab not found,…
-  Fix: likely a path issue, so try :ref:`Correcting your install
   paths <correcting_install_paths>`
-  Related Issues:
   `#538 <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues/538>`_

4. Landlab + Jupyter Notebook problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Related issues:
   `#540 <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues/540>`_

5. Tutorial fails
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Import error
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Symptom: ``Cannot import name 'ModuleName'`` This is because a module
   used by the tutorial is not included in the latest release: do the
   :ref:`developer install <developer_install>`
   or wait for the next `release <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/releases>`_.

Other known pb:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Cygwin** may create some problems: see issue
   `#349 <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues/349>`_
-  **GRASS GIS** and Landlab might not like each other too much:
   :ref:`Install GRASS GIS after installing Landlab <grass>`


If this does not solve your issue:
----------------------------------

-  Try a clean install: uninstall and reinstall conda, etc.
-  Use a `conda
   environment <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_
-  Contact the Landlab development team: `create an issue on
   GitHub <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues>`_. Please
   provide all the information you can: the system you are operating on,
   the install you have done, the command that produced the error, what
   the error message is… We will get back to you quickly!
.. _rough_guide:

Rough Guide to Python and Landlab Install
==========================================

*Handling Python installs on Linux if you are non-expert can be a confusing
and frustrating experience. However, one of us (DEJH) has recently gone
through the pain, and offers these thoughts on how to get a Python install
capable of running Landlab onto your machine. (As long as your machine is
Debian...)*

NB: A version of Canopy does exist for linux, but DEJH couldn't get this
to install properly. If you can, this is probably the easier way to go!


What you already have, apt-get, and versioning
----------------------------------------------

Your unix box almost certainly already has a version on Python on it.
However, DEJH found it wasn't the right version in his case. The problem
is that the stable Python (and Python package) versions that are
maintained through the Debian package repository that *apt-get* looks at
tend not to be up to date. This is problematic, as Landlab needs at least
Python 2.7, Numpy 1.8, and Scipy 0.12.
*NOTE: this is very very old. As of Jan 2020, Landlab will require Python 3 or
higher*.
So first, check your version:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python --version

Note the two dashes.
If you got 2.7 or higher, congratulations! You win. No further changes to
python installs are needed. But if you didn't, first check whether you can
simply update through the package manager:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install -u python
    $ python --version

If you're still seeing a sub-2.7 version number (as I was...), you're going
to need to download the python source and install it manually. Go to
`the python download site <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_, select the
link to the highest version
number of Python 2.X available (2.7.6 at time of writing), and download it
as a gzipped source tarball. Then:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tar -xzf the_downloaded_file.tgz
    $ cd the_new_directory
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

You should now have Python 2.7! Close the terminal, reopen, and check:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python2.7

BUT, it's highly likely if you just run "python", you won't get this
version. Check by

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python --version

again. You can resolve this by messing with your ~/.bashrc profile. Open
that file in your favourite text editor, and add at the end:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ alias python="python2.7"

Restart the terminal again, and check the version number now. Should be
right! (You will probably also want to do something similar with ipython,
but DEJH didn't explore that...) 

Installing pip
--------------

You now have the right version of python, but if you try, e.g., *import
numpy*, you'll notice you don't have any packages. This is where pip -
the powerful command line Python package manager - comes in.

Get pip by going to `the pip site
<https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/>`_
and downloading get_pip.py, which links from that page. Navigate to
the folder you downloaded it into, and simply run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo python get_pip.py

This should give you a trouble free install of pip.

Once you have it, make sure you're fully up-to-date:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install --upgrade pip

NB: DO NOT TRY TO INSTALL PIP WITH APT-GET. Pip binds to your Python
install, and the binding probably won't take properly unless you
install through your version of Python, as described here. Note that
there is a copy of pip you can get with apt-get, but you don't
want it.


Downloading the packages
------------------------

Now you have pip and it's bound correctly to your Python install,
adding packages should be trouble free:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo pip install numpy
    $ sudo pip install scipy
    $ sudo pip install matplotlib
    $ sudo pip install sympy
    $ sudo pip install netCDF4

Note in future, you can update these packages to new versions by:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo pip install --upgrade [package_name]

Now test the versions like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python
    >>> import numpy
    >>> numpy.__version__

And everything should now be great. You can now continue to install
Landlab as you would in the main instructions. e.g., if you have
a clone or downloaded copy of Landlab you want to install in
developer mode, just navigate to the download's top level directory
and run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -e .

and test:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python
    >>> import landlab
    >>> landlab.test()

Or alternatively, just grab the release version using pip, as in the
main instructions:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install landlab

& again, test as above.
.. _grass:

=====================
Landlab and GRASS GIS
=====================

Landlab has some known issues when operating alongside GRASS GIS, the
open-source GIS software package. If you're familiar with GRASS, this
will probably come as no surprise to you, since GRASS has known issues a
lot of the time. We believe these difficulties only apply to Apple Macs,
but it's always possible these exist on other platforms too.

The specific problem relates to GRASS needing to bind to your machine's
32bit system Python when installed on a Mac, as opposed to the Conda
python distribution you will install during Landlab setup. If you
install GRASS before Anaconda, you should not have any problems, but if
you install Anaconda first, you will not have a good day. However, there
is a (relatively) simple work-around for this if you do end up in this
situation, and can't face removing Anaconda entirely while you install
GRASS.

Note that on modern Macs, there is also a second critical issue which
will prevent you from installing (and indeed launching) GRASS. GRASS is
fundamentally incompatible with an inbuilt security widget that is
embedded in both OSX El Capitan and Sierra. It is nonetheless possible
to disable this security, however (see below).

Installing GRASS after Anaconda
-------------------------------

(Before trying this, test that you definitely cannot install GRASS.
There's always a chance that you already had the troublesome libraries
and won't need to do this.)

The key issue is that GRASS GIS has a python library called ``wxpython``
as one of its dependencies, but that ``wxpython`` only exists as a 32bit
release for Mac system architecture. Conversely, Anaconda is only easily
accessible as a 64bit release. Happily, this is only an issue while
installing GRASS, so if you're smart you can set the system back to its
original Python during install, then switch it back to Anaconda once you
have GRASS up and running.

This is done by altering the PATH variable, which Anaconda will have
silently modified during installation. This can be found in the (hidden)
file in your system profile called - most likely - ``.bash_profile``.
Simply open the file in a text editor, comment out (#) the line or lines
that add Anaconda to the path (mine reads simply
``export PATH="/Users/daniel/anaconda/bin:$PATH"``), then save again.
This may be enough to allow install, but in order to make sure GRASS can
continue to open once you restore the path, also add a line reading
``export GRASS_PYTHON=/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/pythonw``
BEFORE the commented out line setting the PATH.

You can find out a bit more about messing with your system PATH
:ref:`here <correcting_install_paths>`.

Once you've done this, you can follow the normal GRASS instructions,
installing both its framework packages and GRASS itself. Fire GRASS up
once and check it starts. If it starts up now, you can safely reinstate
the line you commented out in the profile file, and GRASS and Anaconda
will run happily side by side.

Except…

GRASS won't run on OSX El Capitan and later
-------------------------------------------

This isn't really our problem, but we suspect it will nonetheless catch
out many of our users. Apparently, Apple have added an inbuilt layer of
security ("CSR") to their newest operating systems, which treats GRASS
as hostile software and stops it running. A solution which you may be
able to find online is to simply disable this security. This is done by
rebooting into recovery mode, opening a terminal, and running
``csrutil disable``, then restarting as normal. *Allegedly*, doing this
creates no additional security risks beyond what have been present on
older OSX releases for a long time, but PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK. You'll
have to leave it turned off to get GRASS to run. (Reinstate it with
``csrutil enable``, as you'd expect.)

.. _python_installation:

===================
Python Installation
===================

If you have used a decent amount of scientific software on  your machine before, it is
likely that have already installed "pieces" of Python
onto your system. Nevertheless, we *strongly* recommend that if you haven't before,
you download a complete Python distribution, as this will ensure that all of the Python
modules that Landlab needs to run are definitely present. Most of the bug reports we
get about problems installing Landlab relate to conflicts with older or incomplete versions of Python.
Common symptoms are running the python setup commands at the end of this
file, but then not being able to load landlab. Try :ref:`the Test <test_landlab_install>`
to ensure your current distribution with all its dependencies is the default.
If you suspect a path or version problem after you've installed one
of the distributions described below, click :ref:`here <correcting_install_paths>`.

On all platforms (Linux, Windows 7 or greater, and MacOS X), we recommend a
preassembled scientific python distribution such as `Continuum IO's
Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_. Its conda package manager
makes controlling your Python packages easier. (It is also possible to use `Enthought's
Canopy <https://assets.enthought.com/downloads/>`_, but be aware you will need to sign
up for an academic license with Enthought to take full advantage of its features.)

Download and follow the appropriate instructions
for your operating system/distribution. These collections already include compatible
(and in some cases accelerated) versions of all of Landlab's dependencies. **If the
distribution asks if you want to set it as the default Python for your system, say yes.**
Note that both Canopy and Anaconda also provide a front-end, or GUI environment, from
which you can work, making coding, running code, and debugging relatively easy.

**Note if using Anaconda:**
*There have been documented issues with resolution with default inline plotting within the Spyder IDE iPython console. To generate dynamic plots (e.g. Matlab-like plots), we recommend you change the graphics settings in Spyder after installation by following this work flow:*

In *Spyder -> Preferences -> iPython console -> Graphics -> Graphics Backend -> Automatic -> Apply -> OK -> Make sure to restart Spyder to update the preferences.*

On Linux systems, you can also install Python and the Landlab dependencies
from your package manager. If you're running Linux but aren't that familiar
with handling Python packages in it, :ref:`this <rough_guide>`
might help.

(Landlab uses `setuptools <https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/>`_ for
packaging and is configured to automatically download and install the most
up-to-date version of its dependencies from `PyPI
<https://pypi.org/>`_, if a satisfactory version is not already
installed.)

The Test
--------

Once you have a full Python distribution on your machine, it is vital to check that
it has been successfully set as the default copy of Python on your system.

On Linux or Mac, open a Terminal window and and type the lines below (note the ``>`` indicates that you are on a command line)::

  > which python
  > which ipython

This will show your default path to Python and iPython. In each case the path to the file you asked for should be the same and it should clearly refer to Anaconda (or Canopy). Details will depend on your
operating system. For instance, Dan's Macbook Pro shows ``python`` on the path::

   /anaconda/bin/python

On a PC, run ``python`` from your Command Prompt window. You should see a reference to anaconda when it is running.

If you *don't* see reference to your newly installed distribution or the file is not found, click :ref:`here <correcting_install_paths>` to resolve the problem. 

Once you have installed a complete Python distribution on your machine, follow :ref:`these instructions <install>` to install Landlab.
.. _install:

=========================
Installation Instructions
=========================

If you want to use Landlab to explore Earth surface dynamics, this is almost
certainly the correct place to get install instruction. If you want to change
the Landlab source code go to the
:ref:`developer install instructions <developer_install>`.

In order to run Landlab you will need a python distribution. We recommend the
`Anaconda distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_
(version 3.6 or higher).

You can install Landlab using either the pip or conda package management tools.
We distribute Landlab through `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/landlab/>`_
and `conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/landlab>`_.

The following instructions will just install Landlab and its dependencies.
There may be some additional dependencies necessary to run the Landlab
notebooks or develop a model with Landlab (e.g., spyder). Below we also provide
instructions to install a conda environment which includes everything you need
to run the notebooks.

Conda instructions
------------------

Installation
````````````
In a terminal type:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ conda install landlab -c conda-forge

If you work with many different packages that require conflicting dependencies,
consider reading about (and using)
`conda environments <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-environments>`_.

Updating
````````

In a terminal type:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ conda update landlab

Uninstall
`````````

In a terminal type:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda uninstall landlab

Pip Instructions
----------------

Installation
````````````
In a terminal type:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install landlab

Updating
````````

In a terminal type:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install --upgrade landlab

Uninstall
`````````

In a terminal type:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip uninstall landlab

.. _conda_environment:

Conda Environment
-----------------

We have specified a conda environment which will install Landlab and everything
else you need to run the Landlab Notebooks. First get a compressed copy of the
latest release `here <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/releases>`_, or you can
clone the github repo.

Next you will need to have conda installed on your machine. In a terminal
window/command prompt, navigate to the Landlab directory. Then create the
environment with the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda env create --file=environment.yml

This will create a Landlab environment called ``landlab_notebooks``. Activate
that environment so that you will be using that version of python and all of
the dependencies you just installed.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda activate landlab_notebooks

You will need to activate this environment every time you want to use it. See
:ref:`tutorials <tutorials>` for more about Landlab Notebooks.

Additional Resources
--------------------

Over time the core Landlab development team has written resources for
different issues related to installation. These are below. Note that some are
very out of date. For example, one of them describes an installation of
python 2.7. We do not recommend installing a python 2.x version.

========================
Correcting Install Paths
========================

Based on our experience of guiding users through the install process so far, we
have found that the vast majority of technical issues arise due to incorrect
paths to your Python distribution. Basically, your computer does not know where
to look for the correct file or program and you need to tell it where to look
using your system's `$PATH` variable.

Symptoms
--------

1. Typing ``conda`` after an Anaconda install gives ``command not found``.
2. Typing ``which python`` and ``which ipython``
   point to different locations, the files can't be found, or one or other of
   these commands gives an error.
3. The install procedure appeared to go fine, including the test import in the
   Python shell
   :ref:`described at the end of the instructions <test_landlab_install>`,
   but now you can't import Landlab from the Python prompt provided inside Anaconda.
4. As above, but you can't import Landlab from inside an iPython shell or from
   an iPython Notebook.
5. Landlab appears to import OK (though there may be warnings or errors at the
   time of import), but when you try to use it you see lots of errors and
   warnings indicating it can't find Python modules it needs (e.g., NumPy,
   SciPy).

You may have some subset of the above symptoms occurring together, but one is
normally enough to indicate a Python conflict is the problem.

The Solution
------------

Path problems can be solved by editing your environmental variables. How you do
this is system dependent. A rough outline for how to do this on MAC/LINUX or
PC follows.

.. _the_hard_way:

MAC/LINUX
---------

To set your path variables in a MAC/LINUX system, you will need to manually
edit the ``.profile`` or ``.rc`` files for your terminal shell.

The most commonly used shell is ``bash``. Both Anaconda and Canopy assume
you're running the Bash shell and will put the path to your install there.

To find out which shell you're running, open a terminal window and type
``echo $SHELL`` from the prompt. Anything other than ``/bin/bash`` being
returned will require a little more manual set up as described below.

Now that you know which shell you are using, find out where your computer is
looking for your Python files. From the prompt, type ``echo $PATH``.

You will see your PATH, a big long composite string containing lots of
addresses that your computer searches—in order—to find the requested file. If
you ask for ``python`` or ``conda``, for example, it will return the first
``python`` or ``conda`` it finds in its path.

The key here is to understand that *things nearer the front of the PATH get
precedence*.

**Your goal** is to simply have your *new* distribution appear near the
beginning of the ``PATH`` that results when you type ``echo $PATH``.
And…that's not so hard!

Here is how to edit your files to give you the correct path:

Go to your home directory by typing ``cd ~`` from the prompt.

Now get a list of all the files in this folder, including the hidden ones::

    ls -la

Have a thorough look at this list.

If you are using Bash, you're looking for files called ``.profile`` and
``.bash_profile``. Which you have will depend on your system configuration. If
you have *both*, this is probably the root cause of your problem;
``.bash_profile`` overrides ``.profile`` if both are present. In this case,
open ``.profile`` and copy everything you find inside across to
``.bash_profile``.

For example, your profile likely contains several (possibly repeated) entries
clearly referring to Canopy or "EPD" or Anaconda. You can safely comment out
any old installs or repeated text in this file. (Remember, # is the "comment
out" symbol in the Bash terminal). Make sure you don't actually delete anything
else, and we recommend you don't actually remove the ``.profile`` file.

Use your favorite Unix editor to make the changes—almost all machines have
``nano``, which is super basic, but works. Once you're done, save
(Ctrl-X, say yes to save in ``nano``), then quit and restart any apps that are
using Python—including the terminal app itself.
:ref:`Test <test_landlab_install>` if this solved your problem.

If you only have one of ``.bash_profile`` or ``.profile``, open it in an editor
and have a look. You're looking for any obvious references to Python or your
distribution (Anaconda, Canopy) on any of the uncommented-out lines. You'll
probably see several lines that look something like::

    PATH="Users/<your user name>/Library/...:${PATH}"
    export PATH

These lines are modifying your environment property PATH, by prepending the new
path, ``Users/<your user name> /Library/...``, to the old path, ``${PATH}``.

Lines closer to the end of the file can prepend folders closer to the beginning
of your PATH.

In the rare case that you don't see any reference to Anaconda at all, you will
need to add the lines yourself. Add, for example, the following to the file::

    export PATH=~/anaconda/bin:$PATH

As of this writing (11/2016), the default path for an Anaconda installation on
OSX was in the User directory, which means the path command should look
something like this::

    export PATH="/Users/<your user name here>/anaconda/bin:$PATH"

If you are using a shell other than Bash, you can likely find the correct line
of instruction in ``.bash_profile`` and then simply copy it and place it in
your shell's ``.profile`` and ``.rc`` files so that they point to your Anaconda
binaries. However, your shell's ``.profile`` and ``.rc`` files will have
different names, so refer to
`this wikipedia page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell>`_
for some guidance on the names of configuation files for popular shells.

Note the syntax for the shell commands to do this will probably also be
different in each shell! But since both Anaconda and Canopy assume you are
using Bash, another clue will be to start with a copy of the (correct) path
they placed in your `.profile` or `.bash_profile` file and copy that line to
both the ``.profile`` and ``.rc`` files of the shell you are using.

**The skinny:** Find any references to the distribution you want and make sure
they are inserted near the beginning of the path for the shell you are using.
Alternatively, you can simply put the comment-out symbol ``#`` in front of the
lines that are referring to the incorrect path you see when you type
``which python``.

Type ::

     > which python
     > which ipython

In both cases the path should be the same and reference your distribution.


PC
``

On a PC, the same principle of modifying your environment variables applies,
but you access them differently. Go to the Control Panel, then System. On
**Windows 8**, you then want Advanced System Settings, though this will be
similar on older OSes. Go to Advanced, then to the `Environment Variables...`
button. Under User Variables, see if there is an entry called PATH. If there
is, we will modify it. If there isn't, we will create one. It is
**VERY IMPORTANT** that you do not modify any existing text, *especially*
under `System Variables` below.

As is the situation for Mac, above, the system reads these PATH strings from
left to right, and stops once it has found what it is looking for. It also
reads User before System variables. Hence, we want to add new strings to the
left hand (start) of the existing text, if there is any.

First, scan the existing string(s) (including under System) to see if there is
any reference to the Python distribution you are trying to set as default
already there. e.g., my User PATH (running Anaconda cleanly) currently reads::

    C:\Users\Dan\AppData\Local\Continuum\Anaconda;C:\Users\Dan\AppData\Local\Continuum\Anaconda\Scripts

If you find a reference or references like this to the version you're currently
trying to run, copy the text, and add it (repeated) at the start of the User
string. Copy this syntax—semicolons separate paths.

If you can't find any reference to your chosen version (Canopy/Anaconda),
you'll need to add the PATH yourself. For Anaconda, assuming you installed it
in the default directory, add the above string. For Canopy, use the "Set
Canopy as default" option ("the easy way"), which really should work. See
`this page <http://docs.enthought.com/canopy/quick-start/install_windows.html>`_
for more information on the PATHs used by Canopy if you're still struggling.

If you are on **Windows 10**, you need to make sure you see these paths.

If you installed for a single user::

    C:\Users\your_user_name\Anaconda3
    C:\Users\your_user_name\Anaconda3\Scripts

If you installed for all users::

    C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3
    C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Scripts

Note, if you aren't sure how you installed, just search for 'Anaconda3' on the
main drive to find where it was installed.

Note that modifying the User Variables will only affect the current user
account. Add the text—carefully!!—to the System Variables if you want the
changes for all users.

Type ::

     > where python
     > where ipython

In both cases the path should be the same and reference your distribution.

Other issues
------------

Other install issues often mean that some component of your Python distribution
is out of date. A very common culprit is ``setuptools``, which—extremely
frustratingly—isn't updated by a ``conda update --all`` call for Anaconda.
Other packages can also cause this kind of problem if out of date. An example
of a ``setuptools`` related error we've seen recently ends with::

    error: unknown file type '.pyx' (from 'landlab/components/flexure/cfuncs.pyx')

...combined with warnings referencing a problem with PEP 440.

To our knowledge, this issue only arises for developer installs.

Resolve the issue by updating your distribution. For Anaconda, from a terminal just run::

    > conda update --all
    > conda update setuptools

Finally, if you are still having problems, you can use the nuclear option and
start again from scratch.

For example, your Anaconda distribution is contained in one folder. You can
move this folder to the trash and install a fresh version following the
directions on the `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ site.

Update ``conda`` and ``pip``, uninstall Landlab, and then install a fresh copy.
