# Statement of Need

TOUGH is a widely used general purpose numerical simulator designed for fluid and heat flows of multiphase, multicomponent fluid mixtures in porous and fractured media, which has been applied to many real-world problems such as underground geological storage, geothermal reservoir engineering or nuclear waste disposal, to name a few.

When setting up a model, the most time-consuming part is preparing the input data required to run a TOUGH simulation due to its error-prone text-based fixed-format input files and the lack of proper built-in meshing tool to model complex geological structures. In addition, a TOUGH mesh is optimally represented by a Voronoi graph as TOUGH uses an integral finite-difference formulation [@narasimhan_integrated_1976] to solve the coupled fluid and heat flow equations. A TOUGH mesh is only represented as a set of elements and connections without any reference to a coordinate system usually required for post-processing with common visualization softwares (e.g. ParaView, Tecplot and VisIt).

# Summary

In the recent years, many softwares have been developed and published to address the lack of pre- and post-processing features of TOUGH family of codes, mostly in the form of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) such as (free) TIM [@yeh_tim_2013], TOUGH2Viewer [@bondua_tough2viewer:_2012], (commercial) Leapfrog [@newson_application_2012], mView [@avis_mview_2012] or PetraSim [@yamamoto_petrasim_2008]. While GUIs provide a convenient integrated working environment since they do not require to have any programming knowledge, users are often limited to the features implemented in the softwares and pre- and post-processing outputs are hardly reproducible due to closed or proprietary formats. Besides, automation of runs or coupled simulations (e.g. with a mechanical simulator) cannot be carried out through a GUI. All of the aforementioned issues can be addressed by using a high level scripting language such as Python.

`toughio` is a lightweight, object-oriented and vectorized Python library that aims to provide user-friendly routines to facilitate pre- and post-processing of a TOUGH simulation. Currently, to the best of our knowledge, only PyTOUGH [@croucher_pytough_2011] offers an exhaustive list of features to carry out a complete TOUGH simulation using a scripting language. `toughio` and PyTOUGH share the same objectives, yet with different approaches. On the one hand, a PyTOUGH mesh is represented as a _MULGRAPH_ geometry where elements can be unstructured horizontally but only layered vertically (usually referred to as 2.5D). On the other hand, although it provides basic meshing features, `toughio` mostly relies on common third-party softwares (e.g. Abaqus, FLAC3D, Gmsh [@geuzaine_gmsh:_2009], LaGriT) to generate the mesh by importing and converting it to a TOUGH mesh, which also conveniently facilitates the coupling of TOUGH with any other simulator that also supports the same mesh formats. In addition, `toughio` mainly targets the latest version TOUGH3 [@jung_tough3_2017] and supports most of its new features such as the new input data blocks, the new output formats, and variable length element names. Nevertheless, `toughio` is backward compatible with TOUGH2 [@pruess_tough2_2012] and can read/write TOUGH2 input/output files.

Figure 1 shows the result of a sample CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration simulation where supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> is continuously injected during 3 years in a reservoir near a fault modeled as a finite-thickness element with high permeability. The model has been entirely set up using `toughio` with a mesh generated by Gmsh imported and pre-processed in Python thanks to `meshio` [@nico_schlomer_2020_3888325]. The conversion from a finite-element mesh to its dual-graph representation as required by TOUGH is automatically handled by `toughio` when exporting the mesh for TOUGH. Outputs of the TOUGH simulation have been imported and remapped into the original finite-element grid and directly visualized in Python thanks to `pyvista` [@sullivan_pyvista_2019].

![Example of simulation of CO<sub>2</sub> upward leakage along a fault completely developed with `toughio`. Mesh has been generated with Gmsh and imported in Python by `meshio`. Output figure has been prepared and exported by `pyvista`.](./figures/sample.png)

`toughio` offers a complete set of features to pre- and post-process a TOUGH simulation in Python. Finite-element meshes generated by third-party softwares can be imported and converted to a Voronoi graph for TOUGH, simulation parameters can be defined using a human-readable and jsonable dictionary automatically converted to a fixed-format input file for TOUGH, and simulation results can be imported in Python for post-processing and visualization.

`TOUGH <https://tough.lbl.gov/>`__ (Transport Of Unsaturated Groundwater and Heat) is a general purpose numerical simulation software designed for fluid and heat flows of multiphase, multicomponent fluid mixtures in porous and fractured media developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It solves mass and energy balance equations that describe fluid and heat flow in multiphase and multicomponent systems. TOUGH handles all types of multiphase and multicomponent flow systems since the governing equations for fluid and heat flow have the same mathematical form. The nature and properties of fluid mixtures are described by thermophysical variables (e.g., density, viscosity, enthalpy) which are provided by an equation-of-state (EOS) module.

**toughio** is an open-source library that provides tools to facilitate pre- and post-processing for TOUGH using the latest Python standards. It aims to make setting up of a TOUGH simulation user-friendly by relying on existing well-established Python packages:

-  `numpy <https://numpy.org/>`__: vectorized calculation of N-dimensional arrays,
-  `meshio <https://github.com/nschloe/meshio>`__: input/output for many mesh formats,
-  `pyvista <https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista>`__: 3D plotting and mesh analysis through a streamlined interface for the Visualization Toolkit (VTK).

Note that the results of a TOUGH simulation are sensitive to the quality of the mesh (ideally, it should satisfy the orthogonality condition). A mesh that contains too many ill-shaped cells can potentially lead to unexpected results although the simulation converged successfully. **toughio** does not verify the quality of the mesh which is left to the discretion of the user.

   Simulation of CO\ :sub:`2`\  leakage along a fault. Mesh generated with Gmsh and animation exported by PyVista.

Features
--------

Meshing:

-  Create simple 2D cylindric or 2D/3D structured meshes similarly to TOUGH's built-in *MESHMAKER*,
-  Import mesh generated by external softwares (e.g., `Abaqus <https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/>`__, `FLAC3D <https://www.itascacg.com/software/flac3d>`__, `Gmsh <http://gmsh.info/>`__, `LaGriT <https://meshing.lanl.gov/>`__),
-  Export imported or generated mesh to a *MESH* file for TOUGH assuming `conformity <https://www.quora.com/What-is-non-conformal-mesh-in-CFD>`__ (and optionally write initial condition file *INCON*).

Pre-processing:

-  Easily add initial conditions, boundary conditions or other physical properties (e.g., porosity, permeability) using the convenient class ``toughio.Mesh``,
-  Import previous TOUGH simulation input file into Python or define simulation parameters in a human-readable and `JSON <http://json.org/>`__\ able dictionary,
-  Export simulation parameters dictionary to a TOUGH input file.

Post-processing:

-  Import outputs of a TOUGH simulation into Python,
-  Visualize results directly in Python using `pyvista <https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista>`__ or export the results to another format supported by `meshio <https://github.com/nschloe/meshio>`__ (e.g., VTK, Tecplot...),
-  Create animations (GIF or MP4) or export results for all time steps to a XDMF file to be visualized in ParaView.

Installation
------------

The recommended way to install **toughio** and all its dependencies is through the Python Package Index:

.. code:: bash

   pip install toughio[full] --user

Otherwise, clone and extract the package, then run from the package location:

.. code:: bash

   pip install .[full] --user

To test the integrity of the installed package, check out this repository and run:

.. code:: bash

   git lfs pull
   pytest

Documentation
-------------

Refer to the online `documentation <https://keurfonluu.github.io/toughio//>`__ for detailed description of the API and examples.

Alternatively, the documentation can be built using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__:

.. code:: bash

   pip install -r doc/requirements.txt
   sphinx-build -b html doc/source doc/build

Note that some sample files are stored with LFS, so you may have to run the following command beforehand:

.. code:: bash

   git lfs pull

Usage
-----

In Python, to read a mesh and write the corresponding TOUGH *MESH* file (without any pre-processing), simply do

.. code:: python

   import toughio

   mesh = toughio.read_mesh(
      filename,
      file_format="flac3d",  # Optional, inferred from file extension otherwise
   )
   mesh.write_tough()  # Write MESH file

Parameters of a TOUGH simulation can be defined as a dictionary with specific keywords following the JSON standard, for instance

.. code:: python

   parameters = {
      "title": "Sample title",
      "eos": "eco2n",
      "isothermal": False,
      "default": {  # Default rock properties
         "density": 2600.0,
         "porosity": 0.1,
         # "permeability", "conductivity", "specific_heat"...
      },
      "rocks": {
         "shale": {  # To overwrite default rock properties
            "capillarity": {
               "id": 1,
               "parameters": [0.0, 0.0, 1.0],
            },
            # same keywords as in "default"
         },
         # other materials
      },
      "options": {
         "n_cycle": 100,
         "t_max": 3.0 * 365.25 * 24.0 * 3600.0,
         # "t_ini", "t_steps", "t_step_max", "gravity", "eps1", "eps2"...
      },
      # "extra_options", "selections", "solver", "generators"...
   }
   toughio.write_input("INFILE", parameters)

TOUGH simulation output can also be imported into Python as a list of *namedtuple* (``type``, ``format``, ``time``, ``labels``, ``data``)

.. code:: python

   output = toughio.read_output(filename)

**toughio** is mainly intended to be used as a Python scripting library for TOUGH. Nevertheless, several utility command line scripts are available for users who are not familiar with Python. From a console or terminal, the user can execute the following scripts:

-  ``toughio-co2tab``: copy file *CO2TAB* to the target directory,
-  ``toughio-export``: export TOUGH simulation results to a file for visualization (VTK, VTU, Tecplot or XDMF),
-  ``toughio-extract``: extract results from TOUGH main output file and reformat as a TOUGH3 element or connection output file (mostly useful for TOUGH2 output *before* calling ``toughio-export``),
-  ``toughio-merge``: merge input file, MESH and/or INCON into a single file (for storage or sharing),
-  ``toughio-save2incon``: convert a *SAVE* file to an *INCON* file (mostly useful to automatically restart a simulation and reset the counters).
