# Open-3SPN2
A Implementation of the 3SPN.2 and 3SPN.2C coarse-grained molecular model of DNA in OpenMM.

3SPN.2 and 3SPN.2C are DNA coarse-grained forcefields developed by the [de Pablo group](https://pme.uchicago.edu/group/de-pablo-group). Each DNA nucleotide is modelled by 3 beads: one bead for the phosphate, a second one for the sugar and a third one nucleobase. These forcefields were adapted by the [Wolynes group](https://wolynes.rice.edu/) to model protein-DNA interactions as a complement for the [AWSEM](https://github.com/npschafer/openawsem) coarse-grained protein forcefield.

## Installation

Installation of the open3SPN2 repository is available through anaconda. Some of the dependencies  are contained in the omnia channel (openmm, pdbfixer) or in the conda-forge channel (mdtraj).

```conda config --append channels omnia```

```conda config --append channels conda-forge```

```conda install -c wolynes-lab open3spn2```

It is also necessary to install [X3DNA](http://x3dna.org/) >= 2.4 and set the environment variable `$X3DNA` to the location of the installation folder.For protein-DNA simulations you will also need to install [openAWSEM](https://github.com/npschafer/openawsem) and add the openAWSEM path to the `$PYTHONPATH` environment variable. In linux you can set the path variables on `~/.bashrc`.

```export X3DNA=/path/to/x3dna-v2.4```

```export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/openAWSEM:$PYTHONPATH```

Note: open3SPN2 requires the installation of openMM. As of Feb 10 2020, openMM requires 3.5 <= python <= 3.7 and 7.5 <= CUDA <= 10.1.
