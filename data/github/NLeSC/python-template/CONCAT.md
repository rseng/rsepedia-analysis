# Add your existing code to directory generated by the NLeSC Python template

The following steps requires that your existing code is in a GitHub repository.

1. Follow the [instructions to create a new package](https://github.com/NLeSC/python-template#how-to-use) with the Python template, while answering the questions like you would for the existing package.

2. Create a Git structure for the new directory: (replace  `<NEW_DIRECTORY>` with directory name you used during cookiecutter questionnaire)
```shell
$ cd <NEW_DIRECTORY>
$ git init
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "Added code generated by cookiecutter"
$ git branch -M main
```

3. Import the existing repository from GitHub (Replace `<ORGANIZATION>` with your GitHub organization name , `<REPOSITORY>` with your GitHub repository name and `<BRANCH>` with your default branch for example `main` or `master`):
```shell
$ git remote add -f existing_code https://github.com/<ORGANIZATION>/<REPOSITORY>
$ git fetch existing_code
$ git merge existing_code/<BRANCH> --allow-unrelated-histories
```

4. The previous step will likely result in several merge conflicts. Solve the conflicts by editing the files.
5. Once all conflicts have been resolved then add all the files to GitHub:
```shell
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "Merged existing code with code generated by cookiecutter"
$ git push
```

# Developer documentation

If you're looking for user documentation, go [here](README.md).

## Development install

### Install `cookiecutter` in user space

We recommend installing `cookiecutter` in user space as per `cookiecutter`'s instructions. This way, you don't have to
install `cookiecutter` for every new project.

```shell
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade cookiecutter
```

### Get your own copy of the repository

Before you can do development work on the template, you'll need to check out a local copy of the repository:

```shell
cd <where you keep your GitHub repositories>
git clone https://github.com/NLeSC/python-template.git
cd python-template
```

### Create a virtual environment

Next, make a virtual environment, activate it, and install the development dependencies in it. This will enable you to 
run the tests later.

```shell
# Create a virtual environment, e.g. with
python3 -m venv env

# activate virtual environment
source env/bin/activate

# make sure to have a recent version of pip and setuptools
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

# (from the project root directory)
# install development dependencies
python3 -m pip install --no-cache-dir .[dev]
```

## Running the tests

Running the tests requires an activated virtual environment with the development tools installed.

```shell
# unit tests
pytest
pytest tests/
```

## Using `cookiecutter` to generate a new package from the command line

While making changes to the template, you'll regularly want to verify that the packages generated with the template
still work. Any easy way to do this is to generate new packages in a temporary directory (which will get removed
everytime you reboot), for example like so:

```shell
# change directory to a new temporary directory
cd $(mktemp -d --tmpdir cookiecutter-generated.XXXXXX)

# run cookiecutter with the template to generate a new package
cookiecutter <path to where your template is>

# when it asks you for the GitHub organization, put in your own name;
# for the other questions, just accept the default

# 'ls' should return just the one directory called 'my-python-project'
ls 
```

If your Python package was created successfully, `cookiecutter` will point you to a file
(`my-python-project/next_steps.md`) that contains information on next steps.

In addition to the information in `my-python-project/project_setup.md`, the developer documentation
`my-python-project/README.dev.md` contains information on a few more things to check, for example:

1. generating `my-python-project`'s documentation locally
1. running `my-python-project`'s tests locally
1. running `my-python-project`'s linters locally
1. verifying that the `my-python-project`'s version can be updated using `bumpversion`
1. making a release of `my-python-project` on https://test.pypi.org/

Follow the instructions from `my-python-project/README.dev.md` and make sure that everything works.

## Making a release

### Preparation

1. Make sure the `CHANGELOG.md` has been updated
2. Verify that the information in `CITATION.cff` is correct, and that `.zenodo.json` contains equivalent data
3. Make sure that `version` in [setup.cfg](setup.cfg) and  `version` in [CITATION.cff](CITATION.cff) have been bumped to the to-be-released version of the template
4. Run the unit tests with `pytest tests/`
5. Go through the steps outlined above for [generating a new package from the command line](#using-cookiecutter-to-generate-a-new-package-from-the-command-line), and verify that the generated package works as it should.

### GitHub

1. Make sure that the GitHub-Zenodo integration is enabled for https://github.com/NLeSC/python-template
1. Go to https://github.com/NLeSC/python-template/releases and click `Draft a new release`

## How to use

### Step 1/3: Install `cookiecutter`

We recommend installing `cookiecutter` in user space as per `cookiecutter`'s instructions. This way, you don't have to
install `cookiecutter` for every new project.

```shell
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade cookiecutter
```

### Step 2/3: Generate the files and directory structure

Run `cookiecutter` with the template:

```shell
# Notes:
#   1. See table below for explanation of each question
#   2. The files will be generated in a new directory
cookiecutter https://github.com/nlesc/python-template.git
```

| Name                      | Default value | Explanation |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| directory_name              | my-python-project | Name of the directory that contains the package. Avoid using spaces or uppercase letters for the best experience across operating systems. To get an impression of what will be generated, see the directory tree [below](https://github.com/NLeSC/python-template#step-33-read-about-what-was-just-generated) |
| package_name              | my_python_package | Name of the package. Avoid using spaces, dashes, or uppercase letters for the best experience across operating systems. |
| package_short_description | Short description of package | The information that you enter here will end up in the README, documentation, license, and setup.cfg, so it may be a good idea to prepare something in advance. |
| keyword1                  | keyword1          | A term that describes your package. |
| keyword2                  | keyword2          | Another term that describes your package. |
| version                   | 0.1.0             | &nbsp; |
| github_organization       | &lt;my-github-organization&gt; | GitHub organization that will contain this project's repository. This can also be your GitHub user name. |
| license                   | Apache Software License 2.0 | The software license under which the code is made available.  |
| full_name                 | Jane Smith        | Your full name, e.g. _Jane Smith_. |
| email                     | yourname@esciencecenter.nl | Your (work) email address. |
| copyright_holder          | Netherlands eScience Center | Name(s) of the organization(s) or person(s) who hold the copyright of the software. |
| code_of_conduct_email     | yourname@esciencecenter.nl | Email address of the person who should be contacted in case of violations of the Code of Conduct. |

Once the project files have been generated, follow the steps outlined in
[{{cookiecutter.directory_name}}/next_steps.md]({{cookiecutter.directory_name}}/next_steps.md).

1. use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/nlesc/python-template/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;
1. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue, making sure to provide enough information to the rest of the community to understand the cause and context of the problem. Depending on the issue, you may want to include:
    - the [SHA hashcode](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/#commit-shas) of the commit that is causing your problem;
    - some identifying information (name and version number) for dependencies you're using;
    - information about the operating system;
1. apply relevant labels to the newly created issue.

## You want to make some kind of change to the code base

1. (**important**) announce your plan to the rest of the community _before you start working_. This announcement should be in the form of a (new) issue;
1. (**important**) wait until some kind of consensus is reached about your idea being a good idea;
1. if needed, fork the repository to your own Github profile and create your own feature branch off of the latest main commit. While working on your feature branch, make sure to stay up to date with the main branch by pulling in changes, possibly from the 'upstream' repository (follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) and [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/));
1. Install dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`;
1. make sure the existing tests still work by running ``pytest``. If project tests fails use ``pytest --keep-baked-projects`` to keep generated project in /tmp/pytest-* and investigate;
1. add your own tests (if necessary);
1. update or expand the documentation;
1. push your feature branch to (your fork of) the Python Template repository on GitHub;
1. create the pull request, e.g. following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

In case you feel like you've made a valuable contribution, but you don't know how to write or run tests for it, or how to generate the documentation: don't let this discourage you from making the pull request; we can help you! Just go ahead and submit the pull request, but keep in mind that you might be asked to append additional commits to your pull request.

# Project Setup

Here we provide some details about the project setup. Most of the choices are explained in the
[guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl). Links to the relevant sections are included below. Feel free to remove this
text when the development of the software package takes off.

For a quick reference on software development, we refer to [the software guide
checklist](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/best_practices/checklist).

## Python versions

This repository is set up with Python versions:

- 3.6
- 3.7
- 3.8
- 3.9

Add or remove Python versions based on project requirements. See [the
guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/best_practices/language_guides/python) for more information about Python
versions.

## Package management and dependencies

You can use either pip or conda for installing dependencies and package management. This repository does not force you
to use one or the other, as project requirements differ. For advice on what to use, please check [the relevant section
of the
guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/best_practices/language_guides/python?id=dependencies-and-package-management).

- Runtime dependencies should be added to `setup.cfg` in the `install_requires` list under `[options]`.
- Development dependencies should be added to `setup.cfg` in one of the lists under `[options.extras_require]`.

## Packaging/One command install

You can distribute your code using PyPI.
[The guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/best_practices/language_guides/python?id=building-and-packaging-code) can
help you decide which tool to use for packaging.

## Testing and code coverage

- Tests should be put in the `tests` folder.
- The `tests` folder contains:
  - Example tests that you should replace with your own meaningful tests (file: `test_my_module.py`)
- The testing framework used is [PyTest](https://pytest.org)
  - [PyTest introduction](http://pythontesting.net/framework/pytest/pytest-introduction/)
  - PyTest is listed as a development dependency
  - This is configured in `setup.cfg`
- The project uses [GitHub action workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to automatically run tests on GitHub infrastructure against multiple Python versions
  - Workflows can be found in [`.github/workflows`](.github/workflows/)
- [Relevant section in the guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/best_practices/language_guides/python?id=testing)

## Documentation

- Documentation should be put in the [`docs/`](docs/) directory. The contents have been generated using `sphinx-quickstart` (Sphinx version 1.6.5).
- We recommend writing the documentation using Restructured Text (reST) and Google style docstrings.
  - [Restructured Text (reST) and Sphinx CheatSheet](https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html)
  - [Google style docstring examples](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).
- The documentation is set up with the ReadTheDocs Sphinx theme.
  - Check out its [configuration options](https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- [AutoAPI](https://sphinx-autoapi.readthedocs.io/) is used to generate documentation for the package Python objects.
- `.readthedocs.yaml` is the ReadTheDocs configuration file. When ReadTheDocs is building the documentation this package and its development dependencies are installed so the API reference can be rendered.
- [Relevant section in the guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/best_practices/language_guides/python?id=writingdocumentation)

## Coding style conventions and code quality

- [Relevant section in the NLeSC guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/best_practices/language_guides/python?id=coding-style-conventions) and [README.dev.md](README.dev.md).

## Continuous code quality

[Sonarcloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) is used to perform quality analysis and code coverage report

- `sonar-project.properties` is the SonarCloud [configuration](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/analysis-parameters/) file
- `.github/workflows/sonarcloud.yml` is the GitHub action workflow which performs the SonarCloud analysis

## Package version number

- We recommend using [semantic versioning](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/best_practices/releases?id=semantic-versioning).
- For convenience, the package version is stored in a single place: `{{ cookiecutter.directory_name }}/.bumpversion.cfg`.
- Don't forget to update the version number before [making a release](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/best_practices/releases)!

## Logging

- We recommend using the logging module for getting useful information from your module (instead of using print).
- The project is set up with a logging example.
- [Relevant section in the guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/best_practices/language_guides/python?id=logging)

## CHANGELOG.md

- Document changes to your software package
- [Relevant section in the guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/best_practices/releases?id=changelogmd)

## CITATION.cff

- To allow others to cite your software, add a `CITATION.cff` file
- It only makes sense to do this once there is something to cite (e.g., a software release with a DOI).
- Follow the [making software citable](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/citable_software/making_software_citable) section in the guide.

## CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

- Information about how to behave professionally
- [Relevant section in the guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/best_practices/documentation?id=code-of-conduct)

## CONTRIBUTING.md

- Information about how to contribute to this software package
- [Relevant section in the guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/best_practices/documentation?id=contribution-guidelines)

## MANIFEST.in

- List non-Python files that should be included in a source distribution
- [Relevant section in the guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/best_practices/language_guides/python?id=building-and-packaging-code)

## NOTICE

- List of attributions of this project and Apache-license dependencies
- [Relevant section in the guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/best_practices/licensing?id=notice)
# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

[0.0.1]: https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/releases/tag/v0.0.1
# `{{ cookiecutter.package_name }}` developer documentation

If you're looking for user documentation, go [here](README.md).

## Development install

```shell
# Create a virtual environment, e.g. with
python3 -m venv env

# activate virtual environment
source env/bin/activate

# make sure to have a recent version of pip and setuptools
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

# (from the project root directory)
# install {{ cookiecutter.package_name }} as an editable package
python3 -m pip install --no-cache-dir --editable .
# install development dependencies
python3 -m pip install --no-cache-dir --editable .[dev]
```

Afterwards check that the install directory is present in the `PATH` environment variable.

## Running the tests

Running the tests requires an activated virtual environment with the development tools installed.

```shell
pytest -v
```

## Running linters locally

For linting we will use [prospector](https://pypi.org/project/prospector/) and to sort imports we will use
[isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/). Running the linters requires an activated virtual environment with the
development tools installed.

```shell
# linter
prospector

# recursively check import style for the {{ cookiecutter.package_name }} module only
isort --recursive --check-only {{ cookiecutter.package_name }}

# recursively check import style for the {{ cookiecutter.package_name }} module only and show
# any proposed changes as a diff
isort --recursive --check-only --diff {{ cookiecutter.package_name }}

# recursively fix import style for the {{ cookiecutter.package_name }} module only
isort --recursive {{ cookiecutter.package_name }}
```

To fix readability of your code style you can use [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf).

You can enable automatic linting with `prospector` and `isort` on commit by enabling the git hook from `.githooks/pre-commit`, like so:

```shell
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks
```

## Generating the API docs

```shell
cd docs
make html
```

The documentation will be in `docs/_build/html`

If you do not have `make` use

```shell
sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build/html
```

To find undocumented Python objects run

```shell
cd docs
make coverage
cat _build/coverage/python.txt
```

To [test snippets](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/doctest.html) in documentation run

```shell
cd docs
make doctest
```

## Versioning

Bumping the version across all files is done with [bumpversion](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version), e.g.

```shell
bumpversion major
bumpversion minor
bumpversion patch
```

## Making a release

This section describes how to make a release in 3 parts:

1. preparation
1. making a release on PyPI
1. making a release on GitHub

### (1/3) Preparation

1. Update the <CHANGELOG.md> (don't forget to update links at bottom of page)
2. Verify that the information in `CITATION.cff` is correct, and that `.zenodo.json` contains equivalent data
3. Make sure the [version has been updated](#versioning).
4. Run the unit tests with `pytest -v`

### (2/3) PyPI

In a new terminal, without an activated virtual environment or an env directory:

```shell
# prepare a new directory
cd $(mktemp -d --tmpdir {{ cookiecutter.package_name }}.XXXXXX)

# fresh git clone ensures the release has the state of origin/main branch
git clone {{ cookiecutter.repository }} .

# prepare a clean virtual environment and activate it
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

# make sure to have a recent version of pip and setuptools
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

# install runtime dependencies and publishing dependencies
python3 -m pip install --no-cache-dir .
python3 -m pip install --no-cache-dir .[publishing]

# clean up any previously generated artefacts
rm -rf {{ cookiecutter.package_name }}.egg-info
rm -rf dist

# create the source distribution and the wheel
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

# upload to test pypi instance (requires credentials)
twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
```

Visit
[https://test.pypi.org/project/{{cookiecutter.package_name}}](https://test.pypi.org/project/{{cookiecutter.package_name}})
and verify that your package was uploaded successfully. Keep the terminal open, we'll need it later.

In a new terminal, without an activated virtual environment or an env directory:

```shell
cd $(mktemp -d --tmpdir {{ cookiecutter.package_name }}-test.XXXXXX)

# prepare a clean virtual environment and activate it
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

# make sure to have a recent version of pip and setuptools
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

# install from test pypi instance:
python3 -m pip -v install --no-cache-dir \
--index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ \
--extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple {{ cookiecutter.package_name }}
```

Check that the package works as it should when installed from pypitest.

Then upload to pypi.org with:

```shell
# Back to the first terminal,
# FINAL STEP: upload to PyPI (requires credentials)
twine upload dist/*
```

### (3/3) GitHub

Don't forget to also make a [release on GitHub]({{cookiecutter.repository}}/releases/new). If your repository uses the GitHub-Zenodo integration this will also trigger Zenodo into making a snapshot of your repository and sticking a DOI on it.

# Contributing guidelines

We welcome any kind of contribution to our software, from simple comment or question to a full fledged [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

A contribution can be one of the following cases:

1. you have a question;
1. you think you may have found a bug (including unexpected behavior);
1. you want to make some kind of change to the code base (e.g. to fix a bug, to add a new feature, to update documentation);
1. you want to make a new release of the code base.

The sections below outline the steps in each case.

## You have a question

1. use the search functionality [here]({{cookiecutter.repository}}/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;
2. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue;
3. apply the "Question" label; apply other labels when relevant.

## You think you may have found a bug

1. use the search functionality [here]({{cookiecutter.repository}}/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;
1. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue, making sure to provide enough information to the rest of the community to understand the cause and context of the problem. Depending on the issue, you may want to include:
    - the [SHA hashcode](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/#commit-shas) of the commit that is causing your problem;
    - some identifying information (name and version number) for dependencies you're using;
    - information about the operating system;
1. apply relevant labels to the newly created issue.

## You want to make some kind of change to the code base

1. (**important**) announce your plan to the rest of the community *before you start working*. This announcement should be in the form of a (new) issue;
1. (**important**) wait until some kind of consensus is reached about your idea being a good idea;
1. if needed, fork the repository to your own Github profile and create your own feature branch off of the latest master commit. While working on your feature branch, make sure to stay up to date with the master branch by pulling in changes, possibly from the 'upstream' repository (follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) and [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/));
1. make sure the existing tests still work by running ``pytest``;
1. add your own tests (if necessary);
1. update or expand the documentation;
1. update the `CHANGELOG.md` file with change;
1. push your feature branch to (your fork of) the {{ cookiecutter.package_name }} repository on GitHub;
1. create the pull request, e.g. following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

In case you feel like you've made a valuable contribution, but you don't know how to write or run tests for it, or how to generate the documentation: don't let this discourage you from making the pull request; we can help you! Just go ahead and submit the pull request, but keep in mind that you might be asked to append additional commits to your pull request.

title: 'Next step: Sonarcloud integration'
---

Continuous code quality can be handled by [Sonarcloud](https://sonarcloud.io/). This repository is configured to use Sonarcloud to perform quality analysis and code coverage report on each push.

In order to configure Sonarcloud analysis [GitHub Action workflow]({{cookiecutter.repository}}/blob/main/.github/workflows/sonarcloud.yml) you must follow the steps below:

1. go to [Sonarcloud](https://sonarcloud.io/projects/create) to create a new Sonarcloud project
1. login with your GitHub account
1. add Sonarcloud organization or reuse existing one
1. set up a repository
1. go to [new code definition administration page](https://sonarcloud.io/project/new_code?id={{cookiecutter.github_organization}}_{{cookiecutter.directory_name}}) and select `Number of days` option
1. To be able to run the analysis:
   1. a token must be created at [Sonarcloud account](https://sonarcloud.io/account/security/)
   1. the created token must be added as `SONAR_TOKEN` to [secrets on GitHub](https://github.com/{{cookiecutter.github_organization}}/{{cookiecutter.directory_name}}/settings/secrets/actions)
---
title: 'Next step: Citation data'
---

It is likely that your `CITATION.cff` currently doesn't pass validation. The error messages you get from the [`cffconvert`]({{cookiecutter.repository}}/actions/workflows/cffconvert.yml) GitHub Action are unfortunately a bit cryptic, but doing the following helps:

- [ ] Check if the `given-name` and `family-name` keys need updating. If your family name has a name particle like `von` or `van` or `de`, use the `name-particle` key; if your name has a suffix like `Sr` or `IV`, use `name-suffix`. For details, refer to the schema description: https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format
- [ ] Update the value of the `orcid` key. If you do not have an orcid yet, you can get one here [https://orcid.org/](https://orcid.org/).
- [ ] Add more authors if needed
- [ ] Update `date-released` using the YYYY-MM-DD format.
- [ ] Update the `doi` key with the conceptDOI for your repository (see [https://help.zenodo.org](https://help.zenodo.org/) for more information on what a conceptDOI is). If your project doesn't have a DOI yet, you can use the string `10.0000/FIXME` to pass validation.
- [ ] Verify that the `keywords` array accurately describes your project.

Once you do all the steps above, the `cffconvert` workflow will tell you what content it expected to see in `.zenodo.json`. Copy-paste from the GitHub Action log into a new file `.zenodo.json`. Afterwards, the `cffconvert` GitHub Action should be green.


To help you keep the citation metadata up to date and synchronized, the [`cffconvert`]({{cookiecutter.repository}}/actions/workflows/cffconvert.yml) GitHub Action checks the following 6 aspects:

1. Whether your repository includes a `CITATION.cff` file.

    _By including this file, authors of the software can receive credit for the work they put in._

1. Whether your `CITATION.cff` is valid YAML.

    _Visit http://www.yamllint.com/ to see if the contents of your CITATION.cff are valid YAML._

1. Whether your `CITATION.cff` adheres to the schema (as listed in the `CITATION.cff` file itself under key `cff-version`).

    _The Citation File Format schema can be found [here](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format), along with an explanation of all the keys. You're advised to use the latest available schema version._

1. Whether your repository includes a `.zenodo.json` file.

    _With this file, you can control what metadata should be associated with any future releases of your software on Zenodo: things like the author names, along with their affiliations and their ORCIDs, the license under which the software has been released, as well as the name of your software and a short description. If your repository doesn't have a .zenodo.json file, Zenodo will take a somewhat crude guess to assign these metadata._

    _The `cffconvert` GitHub action will tell you what it expects to find in `.zenodo.json`, just copy and paste it to a new file named `.zenodo.json`. The suggested text ignores CITATION.cff's `version`, `commit`, and `date-released`. `cffconvert` considers these keys `suspect` in the sense that they are often out of date, and there is little purpose to telling Zenodo about these properties: Zenodo already knows._

1. Whether `.zenodo.json` is valid JSON.

    _Currently unimplemented, but you can check for yourself on [https://jsonlint.com/](https://jsonlint.com/)._ 

1. Whether `CITATION.cff` and `.zenodo.json` contain equivalent data.

    _This final check verifies that the two files are in sync. The check ignores CITATION.cff's `version`, `commit`, and `date-released`._

title: 'Next step: Linting'
---

Your repository has a [workflow]({{ cookiecutter.repository }}/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml) which [lints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) your code after every push and when creating a pull request.

Linter workflow may fail if `description` or `keywords` field in [setup.cfg]({{ cookiecutter.repository }}/blob/main/setup.cfg) is empty. Please update these fields. To validate your changes run:

```shell
prospector
```

Enabling [githook](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) will automatically lint your code in every commit. You can enable it by running the command below.

```shell
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks
```

title: 'Next step: Enable Zenodo integration'
---

By enabling Zenodo integration, your package will automatically get a DOI which can be used to cite your package. After enabling Zenodo integration for your GitHub repository, Zenodo will create a snapshot and archive each release you make on GitHub. Moreover, Zenodo will create a new DOI for each GitHub release of your code.

To enable Zenodo integration:

1. Go to http://zenodo.org and login with your GitHub account. When you are redirected to GitHub, *Authorize application* to give permission to Zenodo to access your account.
1. Go to <https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/> and enable Zenodo integration of your repository by clicking on `On` toggle button.
2. Your package will get a DOI only after you make a release. Create a new release as described in [README.dev.md]({{cookiecutter.repository}}/blob/main/README.dev.md#33-github)
3. At this point you should have a DOI. To find out the DOI generated by Zenodo:
   1. Visit https://zenodo.org/deposit and click on your repository link
   2. You will find the latest DOI in the right column in Versions box in **Cite all versions?** section
   3. Copy the text of the link. For example `10.5281/zenodo.1310751`
4. Update the badge in your repository
   1. Edit README.md and replace the badge placeholder with the badge link you copied in previous step.
   The badge placeholder is shown below.

      `[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/<replace-with-created-DOI>.svg)](https://doi.org/<replace-with-created-DOI>)`

For FAQ about Zenodo please visit <https://help.zenodo.org/>.
