Beware! If you want to generate this post from R Markdown, use the R Markdown template instead!

  Everywhere in this template (YAML, paths to images), you should change "post-template" to the slug of your post, and "2019-06-04" to the publication date.

Introduction including outline of the post.

### First awesome section

I like Hugo[^1]. Yes, that is how you add a footnote.

#### First awesome subsection of the first awesome section

Here's how to use a Hugo shortcode to add an image.

{{< figure src = "/img/blog-images/2019-06-04-post-template/name-of-image.png" width = "200">}}

{{< figure src = "/img/blog-images/2019-06-04-post-template/name-of-image.png" width = "200" alt = "too short">}}

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Finally... hello subtools 1.0! ðŸ¥³ Read, write and manipulate subtitles in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a>.

Ropensci was very nice, cool ropensci.

#### Second awesome subsection

Here's how to use a Hugo shortcode to embed a tweet. We recommend the use of [Hugo shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) to include tweets, Vimeo or Youtube videos, gists, etc.

Have fun writing your blog post!

Are you preparing a blog post or tech note for rOpenSci, after getting the go-ahead and a tentative publication date from our community manager [Stefanie Butland](https://ropensci.org/authors/stefanie-butland/)? Stay here! The goal of roblog is to provide practical helpers for authors of blog posts and tech notes on rOpenSci website. 

Best paired with [rOpenSci blog guidance](https://blogguide.ropensci.org/).

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("ropenscilabs/roblog")
```
---
title: "Check your post"
output: rmarkdown::html_vignette
vignette: >
  %\VignetteIndexEntry{checks-guidance}
  %\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}
  %\VignetteEncoding{UTF-8}
---

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

Functions to be run on the path to your blog post (rendered, not the Rmd).

## Best practice

`ro_lint_md()` should identify some potential problems and enforce: 

* the use of complete alternative descriptions for image;

* the use of Title Case for the title;

* the use of Sentence case for other headings;

* the absence of "click here" as text for links;

* the proper case (lowerCamelCase) for rOpenSci name;

* the use of Hugo shortcodes for figures;

* the use of Hugo shortcodes for tweets;

* the use of relative links for links to rOpenSci website.

You need to run `render_one` on the path to the Markdown file. 
Some Markdown examples and the corresponding messages below.

---

```{r lint, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
render_one <- function(path) {
  result <- as.character(suppressMessages(roblog::ro_lint_md(path)))
  glue::glue_collapse(c(
    details::details(path, lang = "Markdown", summary = path),"",
  result), 
  sep = "\n")
}

glue::glue_collapse(
  purrr::map_chr(dir(system.file("examples", package = "roblog"), full.names = TRUE), 
               render_one),
  sep = "\n\n----\n\n")

```

## URL validity

`ro_check_urls()` will identify possibly broken URLs.


```{r urls}
path1 <- system.file(file.path("examples", "bad-no-alt.md"),
                                         package = "roblog")

roblog::ro_check_urls(path1)
