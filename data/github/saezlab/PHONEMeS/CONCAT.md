# PHONEMeS

**PHONEMeS** (**PHO**sphorylation **NE**tworks for **M**ass **S**pectrometry) is a method to model signalling networks based on untargeted phosphoproteomics mass spectrometry data and kinase/phosphatase-substrate interactions. 
The newest version of PHONEMeS builds on `CARNIVAL`, and more specifically the `runCARNIVAL`wrapper function. As such, it requires the CARNIVAL package (Version 1.3) to be installed. Additionally, it uses `OmnipathR` to construct prior knowledge networks based on solely kinase-substrate interactions or the combination of kinase-substrate and protein-protein interactions.
The pipeline requires a vector of input nodes (perturbed kinases) and measured nodes (deregulated phosphosites) that are connected by an interactive version of 
IBM Cplex or CBC-COIN solver. The IBM ILOG Cplex is freely available through Academic Initiative [here](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio). The [CBC](https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc) solver is open source and freely available
for any user. Alternatively for smaller cases, users can rely on the freely available 
[lpSolve R-package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lpSolve/index.html).
