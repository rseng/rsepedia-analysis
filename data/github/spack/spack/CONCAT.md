# v0.17.0 (2021-11-05)

`v0.17.0` is a major feature release.

## Major features in this release

1. **New concretizer is now default**
   The new concretizer introduced as an experimental feature in `v0.16.0`
   is now the default (#25502). The new concretizer is based on the
   [clingo](https://github.com/potassco/clingo) logic programming system,
   and it enables us to do much higher quality and faster dependency solving
   The old concretizer is still available via the `concretizer: original`
   setting, but it is deprecated and will be removed in `v0.18.0`.

2. **Binary Bootstrapping**
   To make it easier to use the new concretizer and binary packages,
   Spack now bootstraps `clingo` and `GnuPG` from public binaries. If it
   is not able to bootstrap them from binaries, it installs them from
   source code. With these changes, you should still be able to clone Spack
   and start using it almost immediately. (#21446, #22354, #22489, #22606,
   #22720, #22720, #23677, #23946, #24003, #25138, #25607, #25964, #26029,
   #26399, #26599).

3. **Reuse existing packages (experimental)**
   The most wanted feature from our
   [2020 user survey](https://spack.io/spack-user-survey-2020/) and
   the most wanted Spack feature of all time (#25310). `spack install`,
   `spack spec`, and `spack concretize` now have a `--reuse` option, which
   causes Spack to minimize the number of rebuilds it does. The `--reuse`
   option will try to find existing installations and binary packages locally
   and in registered mirrors, and will prefer to use them over building new
   versions. This will allow users to build from source *far* less than in
   prior versions of Spack. This feature will continue to be improved, with
   configuration options and better CLI expected in `v0.17.1`. It will become
   the *default* concretization mode in `v0.18.0`.

4. **Better error messages**
   We have improved the error messages generated by the new concretizer by
   using *unsatisfiable cores*. Spack will now print a summary of the types
   of constraints that were violated to make a spec unsatisfiable (#26719).

5. **Conditional variants**
   Variants can now have a `when="<spec>"` clause, allowing them to be
   conditional based on the version or other attributes of a package (#24858).

6. **Git commit versions**
   In an environment and on the command-line, you can now provide a full,
   40-character git commit as a version for any package with a top-level
   `git` URL.  e.g., `spack install hdf5@45bb27f58240a8da7ebb4efc821a1a964d7712a8`.
   Spack will compare the commit to tags in the git repository to understand
   what versions it is ahead of or behind.

7. **Override local config and cache directories**
   You can now set `SPACK_DISABLE_LOCAL_CONFIG` to disable the `~/.spack` and
   `/etc/spack` configuration scopes. `SPACK_USER_CACHE_PATH` allows you to
   move caches out of `~/.spack`, as well (#27022, #26735). This addresses
   common problems where users could not isolate CI environments from local
   configuration.

8. **Improvements to Spack Containerize**
   For added reproducibility, you can now pin the Spack version used by
   `spack containerize` (#21910). The container build will only build
   with the Spack version pinned at build recipe creation instead of the
   latest Spack version.

9. **New commands for dealing with tags**
   The `spack tags` command allows you to list tags on packages (#26136), and you
   can list tests and filter tags with `spack test list` (#26842).

# v0.16.0 (2020-11-18)

`v0.16.0` is a major feature release.

## Major features in this release

1. **New concretizer (experimental)** Our new backtracking concretizer is
   now in Spack as an experimental feature. You will need to install
   `clingo@master+python` and set `concretizer: clingo` in `config.yaml`
   to use it. The original concretizer is not exhaustive and is not
   guaranteed to find a solution if one exists. We encourage you to use
   the new concretizer and to report any bugs you find with it. We
   anticipate making the new concretizer the default and including all
   required dependencies for it in Spack `v0.17`. For more details, see
   #19501.

2. **spack test (experimental)** Users can add `test()` methods to their
   packages to run smoke tests on installations with the new `spack test`
   command (the old `spack test` is now `spack unit-test`). `spack test`
   is environment-aware, so you can `spack install` an environment and
   `spack test run` smoke tests on all of its packages. Historical test
   logs can be perused with `spack test results`. Generic smoke tests for
   MPI implementations, C, C++, and Fortran compilers as well as specific
   smoke tests for 18 packages. This is marked experimental because the
   test API (`self.run_test()`) is likely to be change, but we encourage
   users to upstream tests, and we will maintain and refactor any that
   are added to mainline packages (#15702).

3. **spack develop** New `spack develop` command allows you to develop
   several packages at once within a Spack environment. Running
   `spack develop foo@v1` and `spack develop bar@v2` will check
    out specific versions of `foo` and `bar` into subdirectories, which you
    can then build incrementally with `spack install ` (#15256).

4. **More parallelism** Spack previously installed the dependencies of a
   _single_ spec in parallel. Entire environments can now be installed in
   parallel, greatly accelerating builds of large environments. get
   parallelism from individual specs. Spack now parallelizes entire
   environment builds (#18131).

5. **Customizable base images for spack containerize**
    `spack containerize` previously only output a `Dockerfile` based
    on `ubuntu`. You may now specify any base image of your choosing (#15028).

6. **more external finding** `spack external find` was added in `v0.15`,
   but only `cmake` had support. `spack external find` can now find
   `bison`, `cuda`, `findutils`, `flex`, `git`, `lustre` `m4`, `mpich`,
   `mvapich2`, `ncurses`, `openmpi`, `perl`, `spectrum-mpi`, `tar`, and
   `texinfo` on your system and add them automatically to
   `packages.yaml`.

7. **Support aocc, nvhpc, and oneapi compilers** We are aggressively
   pursuing support for the newest vendor compilers, especially those for
   the U.S. exascale and pre-exascale systems. Compiler classes and
   auto-detection for `aocc`, `nvhpc`, `oneapi` are now in Spack (#19345,
   #19294, #19330).

## Additional new features of note

* New `spack mark` command can be used to designate packages as explicitly
  installed, so that `spack gc` will not garbage-collect them (#16662).
* `install_tree` can be customized with Spack's projection format (#18341)
* `sbang` now lives in the `install_tree` so that all users can access it (#11598)
* `csh` and `tcsh` users no longer need to set `SPACK_ROOT` before
  sourcing `setup-env.csh` (#18225)
* Spec syntax now supports `variant=*` syntax for finding any package
  that has a particular variant (#19381).
* Spack respects `SPACK_GNUPGHOME` variable for custom GPG directories (#17139)
* Spack now recognizes Graviton chips

## Major refactors

* Use spawn instead of fork on Python >= 3.8 on macOS (#18205)
* Use indexes for public build caches (#19101, #19117, #19132, #19141,  #19209)
* `sbang` is an external package now (https://github.com/spack/sbang, #19582)
* `archspec` is an external package now (https://github.com/archspec/archspec, #19600)

## Deprecations and Removals

* `spack bootstrap` was deprecated in v0.14.0, and has now been removed.
* `spack setup` is deprecated as of v0.16.0.
* What was `spack test` is now called `spack unit-test`. `spack test` is
  now the smoke testing feature in (2) above.

## Bugfixes

Some of the most notable bugfixes in this release include:

* Better warning messages for deprecated syntax in `packages.yaml` (#18013)
* `buildcache list --allarch` now works properly (#17827)
* Many fixes and tests for buildcaches and binary relcoation (#15687,
  *#17455, #17418, #17455, #15687, #18110)

## Package Improvements

Spack now has 5050 total packages, 720 of which were added since `v0.15`.

* ROCm packages (`hip`, `aomp`, more) added by AMD (#19957, #19832, others)
* Many improvements for ARM support
* `llvm-flang`, `flang`, and `f18` removed, as `llvm` has real `flang`
  support since Flang was merged to LLVM mainline
* Emerging support for `spack external find` and `spack test` in packages.

## Infrastructure

* Major infrastructure improvements to pipelines on `gitlab.spack.io`
* Support for testing PRs from forks (#19248) is being enabled for all
  forks to enable rolling, up-to-date binary builds on `develop`


# v0.15.4 (2020-08-12)

This release contains one feature addition:

* Users can set `SPACK_GNUPGHOME` to override Spack's GPG path (#17139)

Several bugfixes for CUDA, binary packaging, and `spack -V`:

* CUDA package's `.libs` method searches for `libcudart` instead of `libcuda` (#18000)
* Don't set `CUDAHOSTCXX` in environments that contain CUDA (#17826)
* `buildcache create`: `NoOverwriteException` is a warning, not an error (#17832)
* Fix `spack buildcache list --allarch` (#17884)
* `spack -V` works with `releases/latest` tag and shallow clones (#17884)

And fixes for GitHub Actions and tests to ensure that CI passes on the
release branch (#15687, #17279, #17328, #17377, #17732).

# v0.15.3 (2020-07-28)

This release contains the following bugfixes:

* Fix handling of relative view paths (#17721)
* Fixes for binary relocation (#17418, #17455)
* Fix redundant printing of error messages in build environment (#17709)

It also adds a support script for Spack tutorials:

* Add a tutorial setup script to share/spack (#17705, #17722)

# v0.15.2 (2020-07-23)

This minor release includes two new features:

* Spack install verbosity is decreased, and more debug levels are added (#17546)
* The $spack/share/spack/keys directory contains public keys that may be optionally trusted for public binary mirrors (#17684)

This release also includes several important fixes:

* MPICC and related variables are now cleand in the build environment (#17450)
* LLVM flang only builds CUDA offload components when +cuda (#17466)
* CI pipelines no longer upload user environments that can contain secrets to the internet (#17545)
* CI pipelines add bootstrapped compilers to the compiler config (#17536)
* `spack buildcache list` does not exit on first failure and lists later mirrors (#17565)
* Apple's "gcc" executable that is an apple-clang compiler does not generate a gcc compiler config (#17589)
* Mixed compiler toolchains are merged more naturally across different compiler suffixes (#17590)

  explicitly activated (#17454)

This release also adds a mirror for all sources that are
fetched in Spack (#17077). It is expected to be useful when the
official website for a Spack package is unavailable.

# v0.15.0 (2020-06-28)

`v0.15.0` is a major feature release.

## Major Features in this release

1. **Cray support** Spack will now work properly on Cray "Cluster"
systems (non XC systems) and after a `module purge` command on Cray
systems. See #12989

2. **Virtual package configuration** Virtual packages are allowed in
packages.yaml configuration. This allows users to specify a virtual
package as non-buildable without needing to specify for each
implementation. See #14934

3. **New config subcommands** This release adds `spack config add` and
`spack config remove` commands to add to and remove from yaml
configuration files from the CLI. See #13920

4. **Environment activation** Anonymous environments are **no longer**
automatically activated in the current working directory. To activate
an environment from a `spack.yaml` file in the current directory, use
the `spack env activate .` command. This removes a concern that users
were too easily polluting their anonymous environments with accidental
installations. See #17258

5. **Apple clang compiler** The clang compiler and the apple-clang
compiler are now separate compilers in Spack. This allows Spack to
improve support for the apple-clang compiler. See #17110

6. **Finding external packages** Spack packages can now support an API
for finding external installations. This allows the `spack external
find` command to automatically add installations of those packages to
the user's configuration. See #15158


## Additional new features of note

* support for using Spack with the fish shell (#9279)
* `spack load --first` option to load first match (instead of prompting user) (#15622)
* support the Cray cce compiler both new and classic versions (#17256, #12989)
* `spack dev-build` command:
  * supports stopping before a specified phase (#14699)
  * supports automatically launching a shell in the build environment (#14887)
* `spack install --fail-fast` allows builds to fail at the first error (rather than best-effort) (#15295)
* environments: SpecList references can be dereferenced as compiler or dependency constraints (#15245)
* `spack view` command: new support for a copy/relocate view type (#16480)
* ci pipelines: see documentation for several improvements
* `spack mirror -a` command now supports excluding packages (#14154)
* `spack buildcache create` is now environment-aware (#16580)
* module generation: more flexible format for specifying naming schemes (#16629)
* lmod module generation: packages can be configured as core specs for lmod hierarchy (#16517)

## Deprecations and Removals

The following commands were deprecated in v0.13.0, and have now been removed:

* `spack configure`
* `spack build`
* `spack diy`

The following commands were deprecated in v0.14.0, and will be removed in the next major release:

* `spack bootstrap`

## Bugfixes

Some of the most notable bugfixes in this release include:

note in this release are the following:

* Spack now contains 4339 packages. There are 430 newly supported packages in v0.15.0
* GCC now builds properly on ARM architectures (#17280)
* Python: patched to support compiling mixed C/C++ python modules through distutils (#16856)
* improvements to pytorch and py-tensorflow packages
* improvements to major MPI implementations: mvapich2, mpich, openmpi, and others

## Spack Project Management:

* All merges to the `develop` branch run E4S CI pipeline (#16338)
* New `spack debug report` command makes reporting bugs easier (#15834)

# v0.14.2 (2020-04-15)

This is a minor release on the `0.14` series. It includes performance
improvements and bug fixes:

* Improvements to how `spack install` handles foreground/background (#15723)
* Major performance improvements for reading the package DB (#14693, #15777)
* No longer check for the old `index.yaml` database file (#15298)
* Properly activate environments with '-h' in the name (#15429)
* External packages have correct `.prefix` in environments/views (#15475)

# v0.14.1 (2020-03-20)

This is a bugfix release on top of `v0.14.0`.  Specific fixes include:

* several bugfixes for parallel installation (#15339, #15341, #15220, #15197)
* `spack load` now works with packages that have been renamed (#14348)
* bugfix for `suite-sparse` installation (#15326)

* fix issues with `configure_args` during module refresh (#11084)
* increased test coverage and test fixes (#15237, #15354, #15346)
* remove some unused code (#15431)

# v0.14.0 (2020-02-23)

`v0.14.0` is a major feature release, with 3 highlighted features:

1. **Distributed builds.** Multiple Spack instances will now coordinate
   properly with each other through locks. This works on a single node
   (where you've called `spack` several times) or across multiple nodes
   with a shared filesystem. For example, with SLURM, you could build
   `trilinos` and its dependencies on 2 24-core nodes, with 3 Spack
   instances per node and 8 build jobs per instance, with `srun -N 2 -n 6
   spack install -j 8 trilinos`. This requires a filesystem with locking
   enabled, but not MPI or any other library for parallelism.

2.  **Build pipelines.** You can also build in parallel through Gitlab
   CI. Simply create a Spack environment and push it to Gitlab to build
   on Gitlab runners. Pipeline support is now integrated into a single
   `spack ci` command, so setting it up is easier than ever.  See the
   [Pipelines section](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/v0.14.0/pipelines.html)
   in the docs.

3. **Container builds.** The new `spack containerize` command allows you
   to create a Docker or Singularity recipe from any Spack environment.
   There are options to customize the build if you need them. See the
   [Container Images section](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/containers.html)
   in the docs.

In addition, there are several other new commands, many bugfixes and
improvements, and `spack load` no longer requires modules, so you can use
it the same way on your laptop or on your supercomputer.

Spack grew by over 300 packages since our last release in November 2019,
and the project grew to over 500 contributors.  Thanks to all of you for
making yet another great release possible. Detailed notes below.

# v0.13.0 (2019-10-25)

`v0.13.0` is our biggest Spack release yet, with *many* new major features.
From facility deployment to improved environments, microarchitecture
support, and auto-generated build farms, this release has features for all of
our users.

Spack grew by over 700 packages in the past year, and the project now has
over 450 contributors.  Thanks to all of you for making this release possible.

## Major new core features
- Chaining: use dependencies from external "upstream" Spack instances
- Environments now behave more like virtualenv/conda
  - Each env has a *view*: a directory with all packages symlinked in
  - Activating an environment sets `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `CPATH`,
    `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`, `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, etc. to point to this view.
- Spack detects and builds specifically for your microarchitecture
  - named, understandable targets like `skylake`, `broadwell`, `power9`, `zen2`
  - Spack knows which compilers can build for which architectures
  - Packages can easily query support for features like `avx512` and `sse3`
  - You can pick a target with, e.g. `spack install foo target=icelake`
- Spack stacks: combinatorial environments for facility deployment
  - Environments can now build cartesian products of specs (with `matrix:`)
  - Conditional syntax support to exclude certain builds from the stack
- Projections: ability to build easily navigable symlink trees environments
- Support no-source packages (BundlePackage) to aggregate related packages
- Extensions: users can write custom commands that live outside of Spack repo
- Support ARM and Fujitsu compilers

## CI/build farm support
- `spack release-jobs` can detect `package.py` changes and generate
    `.gitlab-ci.yml` to create binaries for an environment or stack
	in parallel (initial support -- will change in future release).
- Results of build pipelines can be uploaded to a CDash server.
- Spack can now upload/fetch from package mirrors in Amazon S3

## New commands/options
- `spack mirror create --all` downloads *all* package sources/resources/patches
- `spack dev-build` runs phases of the install pipeline on the working directory
- `spack deprecate` permanently symlinks an old, unwanted package to a new one
- `spack verify` chcecks that packages' files match what was originally installed
- `spack find --json` prints `JSON` that is easy to parse with, e.g. `jq`
- `spack find --format FORMAT` allows you to flexibly print package metadata
- `spack spec --json` prints JSON version of `spec.yaml`

## Selected improvements
- Auto-build requested compilers if they do not exist
- Spack automatically adds `RPATHs` needed to make executables find compiler
    runtime libraries (e.g., path to newer `libstdc++` in `icpc` or `g++`)
- setup-env.sh is now compatible with Bash, Dash, and Zsh
- Spack now caps build jobs at min(16, ncores) by default
- `spack compiler find` now also throttles number of spawned processes
- Spack now writes stage directories directly to `$TMPDIR` instead of
    symlinking stages within `$spack/var/spack/cache`.
- Improved and more powerful `spec` format strings
- You can pass a `spec.yaml` file anywhere in the CLI you can type a spec.
- Many improvements to binary caching
- Gradually supporting new features from Environment Modules v4
- `spack edit` respects `VISUAL` environment variable
- Simplified package syntax for specifying build/run environment modifications
- Numerous improvements to support for environments across Spack commands
- Concretization improvements

## Documentation
- Multi-lingual documentation (Started a Japanese translation)
- Tutorial now has its own site at spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io
  - This enables us to keep multiple versions of the tutorial around

## Deprecations
- Spack no longer supports dotkit (LLNL's homegrown, now deprecated module tool)
- `spack build`, `spack configure`, `spack diy` deprecated in favor of
    `spack dev-build` and `spack install`

## Important package changes
- 3,563 total packages (718 added since 0.12.1)
- Spack now defaults to Python 3 (previously preferred 2.7 by default)
- Much improved ARM support thanks to Fugaku (RIKEN) and SNL teams
- Support new special versions: master, trunk, and head (in addition to develop)
- Better finding logic for libraries and headers


# v0.12.1 (2018-11-13)

This is a minor bugfix release, with a minor fix in the tutorial and a `flake8` fix.

Bugfixes
* Add `r` back to regex strings in binary distribution
* Fix gcc install version in the tutorial

Spack is a multi-platform package manager that builds and installs
multiple versions and configurations of software. It works on Linux,
macOS, and many supercomputers. Spack is non-destructive: installing a
new version of a package does not break existing installations, so many
configurations of the same package can coexist.

Spack offers a simple "spec" syntax that allows users to specify versions
and configuration options. Package files are written in pure Python, and
specs allow package authors to write a single script for many different
builds of the same package.  With Spack, you can build your software
*all* the ways you want to.

See the
[Feature Overview](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html)
for examples and highlights.

To install spack and your first package, make sure you have Python.
Then:

    $ git clone -c feature.manyFiles=true https://github.com/spack/spack.git
    $ cd spack/bin
    $ ./spack install zlib

Documentation
----------------

[**Full documentation**](https://spack.readthedocs.io/) is available, or
run `spack help` or `spack help --all`.

For a cheat sheet on Spack syntax, run `spack help --spec`.

Tutorial
----------------

We maintain a
[**hands-on tutorial**](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html).
It covers basic to advanced usage, packaging, developer features, and large HPC
deployments.  You can do all of the exercises on your own laptop using a
Docker container.

Feel free to use these materials to teach users at your organization
about Spack.

features, etc. can use `develop`.

Releases
--------

For multi-user site deployments or other use cases that need very stable
software installations, we recommend using Spack's
[stable releases](https://github.com/spack/spack/releases).

Each Spack release series also has a corresponding branch, e.g.
`releases/v0.14` has `0.14.x` versions of Spack, and `releases/v0.13` has
`0.13.x` versions. We backport important bug fixes to these branches but
we do not advance the package versions or make other changes that would
change the way Spack concretizes dependencies within a release branch.
So, you can base your Spack deployment on a release branch and `git pull`
to get fixes, without the package churn that comes with `develop`.

The latest release is always available with the `releases/latest` tag.

See the [docs on releases](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide.html#releases)
for more details.

# Test data for unparser

These are test packages for testing Spack's unparser. They are used to ensure that the
canonical unparser used for Spack's package hash remains consistent across Python
versions.

All of these were copied from mainline Spack packages, and they have been renamed with
`.txt` suffixes so that they're not considered proper source files by the various
checkers used in Spack CI.

These packages were chosen for various reasons, but mainly because:

1. They're some of the more complex packages in Spack, and they exercise more unparser
   features than other packages.

2. Each of these packages has some interesting feature that was hard to unparse
   consistently across Python versions.  See docstrings in packages for details.
This directory vendors the `pluggy` module.

For a more detailed discussion for the reasons to vendoring this 
package, please see [this issue](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/944).

To update the current version, execute:

```
$ pip install -U pluggy==<version> --no-compile --target=_pytest/vendored_packages
```

And commit the modified files. The `pluggy-<version>.dist-info` directory 
created by `pip` should be added as well.

# Archspec (Python bindings)

Archspec aims at providing a standard set of human-understandable labels for
various aspects of a system architecture  like CPU, network fabrics, etc. and
APIs to detect, query and compare them.

This project grew out of [Spack](https://spack.io/) and is currently under
active development. At present it supports APIs to detect and model
compatibility relationships among different CPU microarchitectures.

## Getting started with development

The `archspec` Python package needs [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to
be installed from VCS sources. The preferred method to install it is via
its custom installer outside of any virtual environment:
```console
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
```
You can refer to [Poetry's documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
for further details or for other methods to install this tool. You'll also need `tox`
to run unit test:
```console
$ pip install --user tox
```
Finally you'll need to clone the repository:
```console
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/archspec/archspec.git
```

### Running unit tests
Once you have your environment ready you can run `archspec` unit tests
using ``tox`` from the root of the repository:
```console
$ tox
  [ ... ]
  py27: commands succeeded
  py35: commands succeeded
  py36: commands succeeded
  py37: commands succeeded
  py38: commands succeeded
  pylint: commands succeeded
  flake8: commands succeeded
  black: commands succeeded
  congratulations :)
```

# Legion Spack Package Notes

The Legion Spack package follows the underlying approach used in Legion's CMake-based build infrastructure.  If you are not familiar with using Spack, we encourage you to start with the **[Spack 101 Tutorial](https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**.  For more background on Legion please visit the project [website](https://legion.stanford.edu). There you can find information on getting started, tutorials, and supporting documentation.

## Versions

We strongly recommend the majority of users start with the latest **stable** branch of Legion.  This will guarantee the most regularly tested and debugged version of the code.  We also strive to have quarterly tagged release throughout the calendar year starting March (e.g., legion-YY.MM.0 where MM starts at *'03'* and runs through *'12'* for any calendar year).  These versioned downloads are captured via the [Legion GitHub page](https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion) and captured in the Spack package for individual use via the naming convention above.  The details for each release are captured in the CHANGES.txt file at the top-level of the repository.

## Spack Usage and Details

**NOTE: This version of the Legion *spackage* no longer depends upon an external GASNet spackage.  Instead, as supported and preferred by the GASNet developers, Legion internalizes the GASNet configuration and build process tailored to Legion's needs.  At present this approach should minimize both building and configuration issues that have occurred in the past.**

With a working installation of Spack following variants can be used to download, configure, and build legion.  As of its latest release Legion uses features from C++11 and can be build using either GCC or Clang (and likely any other compilers with full C++11 support).  For example,

    spack install legion %clang@10.0

will build and install Legion using version 10.0 of the clang compiler.  Additional compiler flags (beyond those automatically enabled by the underlying Legion CMake configuration) may be specified by using the `cppflags` option to Spack:

    spack install legion %clang@10.0 cppflags=-Wall

You can find more details about customizing the compiler with Spack [here](https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_basics.html#customizing-compilers).

There are a number of configuration parameters (variants) for Legion that can be specified on the command line.  To see a complete listing of these variants you can use the following command:

    spack info legion

The default build and install of Legion is suitable for laptop/desktop development needs.  Additional variants will need to be specified to build for distributed memory systems, GPU support, and other features (e.g., debugging, profiling, etc.).  A full list of the currently supported variants is provided below.

These variants may then be used on the Spack command line to customize the build of Legion you would like to install.  For boolean-based variants the `+`, `-`, or `~` *sigils* can be used. In this case, the `+` specifies a `True` value and either `-` or `~` can be used for the `False` setting (two values for `False` are provided to avoid conflicts with shell command line parameters. For example,

    spack install legion@stable~cuda+hdf5%clang10.0

will build/install the stable version of Legion without CUDA and with HDF5 support; using Clang 10.0 as the compiler.  See below for more examples of the various package options. 

## Overview of Legion's Spack Variants


This section provides an overview of the variants that are available for builds and installations of Legion and the underlying Realm runtime libraries.  These variants range from important configuration parameters for many users, to more involved and low-level details more likely to be leveraged when debugging correctness and performance issues.  For these last set of use cases we encourage users to visit the Legion [Debugging](https://legion.stanford.edu/debugging/) and [Profiling](https://legion.stanford.edu/profiling/) pages.

Note that any variants with a default of `on` or `off` are boolean values and may be configured on the Spack command line using the `+`, or `-` (or `~`) sigils.

Finally, to build the highest performing installation of Legion requires an appropriate configuration and installation of GASNet-Ex (while we have support for an MPI transport layer it is still in testing and evaluation for achieving the best possible performance).  See the following section for details on the steps needed to build a high-performance install of Legion using Spack.

### Debugging & Internal Runtime Configurations

* **`build_type`**: This variant exposes the CMake build type setting.  Following directly from CMake these available values for this variant are [`Debug`, `RelWithDebInfo`, and `Release`]. `default=RelWithDebInfo`

* **`bounds_checks`**:  This variant supports `on` or `off` values and enables, or disables bounds checking within the runtime's data accessors.  This is helpful for debugging but  does have the potential to degrade performance (therefore it is disabled in the default build).  `default=off`

* **`privilege_checks`**: This variant enables the runtime checking of data privileges in Legion's data accessors. This can helpful in debugging applications. `default=off`

* **`spy`**: This variant enables applications to produce detailed logging information for debugging with the [Legion Spy](https://legion.stanford.edu/debugging/#legion-spy) tool.  `default=off`

* **`max_dims`**: This variant provides an integral value for the maximum number of dimensions in a logical region that are supported by the build/install.  `default=3`  *Note: Currently supported values range from 1 to 9.*

* **`max_fields`**: This variant provides an integral value for the maximum number of fields that may be stored within a logical region.  `default=512` *Note: Internally this requires a value that is a power-of-two -- if a non power-of-two value is provided the next largest power-of-two will be used.*

* **`output_level`**: This variant enables the (dynamic) debugging level for the runtime.  It can be one of the following values: [`spew`, `debug`, `info`, `print`, `warning`, `error`, `fatal`, or `none`].  `default=warning`

* **`papi`**: This variant enables PAPI performance measurements.  `default=off`

* **`redop_complex`** This variant enables support for the reduction of complex types. `default=off`  Note: will be enabled when `+bindings` is set.

* **`shared_libs`**: Build shared libraries for Legion and Realm. `default=off`

* **`enable_tls`**: This variant supports `on` or `off` and enables thread-local-storage of the Legion runtime context.  `default=off`

### Bindings & Interoperability

* **`bindings`**: This variant supports `on` or `off` and will build the language bindings for Legion.  In addition to the required C++ interface, this currently includes C, Python, and Fortran. `default=off`  Note you can use `+python` or `+fortran` to select a subset of these bindings.

* **`python`**: This variant enables Python support in terms of both bindings and runtime support (where instance(s) of the Python interpreter must be available.) `default=off`

* **`fortran`**: This variant supports `on` or `off` and enables building of Fortran language bindings for Legion. `default=off`

[//]: <> (TOOD: More details here on Kokkos interop?)

* **`kokkos`**: Enable support for interoperability with [Kokkos](https://github.com/kokkos) use in Legion tasks. `default=off`

[//]: <> (TOOD: More details here on OpenMP interop?)

* **`openmp`**: This variant enables OpenMP support within Legion tasks (and within the Realm runtime). Please note that the full OpenMP feature set (e.g. OpenMP 5.0) is not fully supported when enabling this feature.  `default=off`

* **`libdl`**: Enable support for dynamic object loading (via "libdl").  `default=on`

### Processor Architecture Support (e.g., GPUs)

* **`cuda`**: This variant supports `on` or `off` and enables CUDA support within Legion.  `default=off`

* **`cuda_arch`**: This variant specifics the specific CUDA architecture to support within the Legion build/installation.  Currently this variant must be one of [`60`, `70`, `75`, or `80`].  Where `60` is the Pascal architecture, `70` is for Volta, `75` is for Turing, and `80` is for `Volta`. `default=70`

* **`cuda_hijack`**:  This variant supports `on` or `off` and determines if the build enables performance enhancements by "*hijacking* entry points into CUDA's runtime API; thus, it obviously implies `+cuda`.This is a performance enhancement and not necessary but suggested for production use cases on NVIDIA-based systems.  `default=off`

### External Library Support

* **`hdf5`**: This variant supports `on` or `off` and enables building of HDF5 support within the runtime. `default=off`

* **`hwloc`**: Build using "libhwloc" support for numa-aware topology support within Realm (Legion's low-level runtime layer).  `default=off`

* **`zlib`**: This variant enables support for zlib. `default=on`

### Distributed Memory/Network Transport/Interconnect Support

* **`network`**: This variant specifies what network transport layer Legion/Realm should use for moving data across the distributed memories of a system.  The options are currently: [`gasnet`, `mpi`, or `none`].  The most tested and reliable interface for distributed memory systems is `gasnet`.  Via this package GASNet will be automatically configured and built. If you want to use a pre-installed version of GASNet you can use the `gasnet_root` variant; this will disable the automatic/internal installation of GASNet. We strongly encourage the use of the automatic configuration and build mechanism as it is tailored to Legion's use cases. If you would like to read more about please visit their [web page](https://gasnet.lbl.gov).  Note that the `mpi` transport layer is new and still being tuned and debugged.  Finally, if you want to run on a single system (e.g., a desktop or laptop) for development activities you may drop this parameter or specify `network=none`.  `default=none`

* **`conduit`** requires `(network=gasnet)` **only**: This variant selects the GASNet conduit to use and must be provided when `network=gasnet`.  The current choices are: [`aries`, `ibv`, `mpi`, `ucx`, `udp`, or `none`]:  defaults to `none`.
  * **aries**: Aries for Cray XC series (see [documentation](https://gasnet.lbl.gov/dist-ex/aries-conduit/README)).
  * **ibv**: OpenIB/OpenFabrics Verbs for InfiniBand (see [documentation](https://gasnet.lbl.gov/dist-ex/ibv-conduit/README)).
  * **mpi**: Portable conduit, works on any network with MPI 1.1 or newer (see [documentation](https://gasnet.lbl.gov/dist-ex/mpi-conduit/README)).
  * **ucx**: *(NOTE: EXPERIMENTAL)*  Unified Communication X framework (see [documentation](https://gasnet.lbl.gov/dist-ex/ucx-conduit/README)).
  * **udp**: Portable conduit, works on any network with a TCP/IP stack (see [documentation](https://gasnet.lbl.gov/dist-ex/udp-conduit/README)).

* **`gasnet_root`**: This variant points the package at a pre-installed version of GASNet for use when building Legion.  This skips the default behavior of embedding the GASNet build within that of Legion. It requires that `conduit` be set to match that used by the installed version of GASNet (*note that incorrectly setting `conduit` could result in failures that are not caught by the Spack package as failures will only occur during the build of Legion*). `default=/usr/local`

## Examples

This section highlights a few common configurations/installations for various common installations of Legion. 

### Laptop/Desktop Development

The default configuration will build a version of Legion without network support that is often helpful in laptop or desktop installs for development using Legion. The first example is the most straightforward and enables a CPU-only configuration of Legion:

`$ spack install legion@stable`

Given that many uses cases for laptop/desktop development involve debugging Legion you might want to consider enabling [Legion Spy](https://legion.stanford.edu/debugging/#legion-spy), bounds and privilege checks, and optionally enable debugging level output diagnostics:

`$ spack install legion@stable +spy +bounds_checks +privilege_checks [output=debug]`

Note that by specifying `+spy` the package will also install the Legion profiler.  Both will be available in the corresponding `bin` directory created by Spack's install mechanisms.

#### Adding GPU Support

To enable support for NVIDIA GPUs with Legion you can add the `+cuda` variant to the examples provided above.  In addition, you can also use the `cuda_arch` flag to enable specific GPU architectures.  For example, the follow command line installs the stable version of Legion with CUDA support for NVIDIA's Volta architecture:

`$ spack install legion@stable +cuda cuda_arch=70`

If you wanted to program tasks using Kokkos support for GPUs you can simply add the `+kokkos` option to the previous command line: 

`$ spack install legion@stable +cuda cuda_arch=70 +kokkos`

this will enable Kokkos interoperability in Legion and also build and configure a version of Kokkos with cuda and Volta GPU support.

#### Networking/Distributed Memory Support 

In order to add modify the above configuration to support a distributed memory architecture you need to add a `network` target.  For example, to build a version of Legion that uses GASNet for the data transport layer you would specify:

`$ spack install legion@stable +cuda cuda_arch=70 +kokkos network=gasnet`

Without the addition of a specific GASNet *conduit* this command will use the UDP conduit. To change this to support a Infniband-based cluster you would add:

`$ spack install legion@stable +cuda cuda_arch=70 +kokkos network=gasnet conduit=ibv`

For a pre-existing installation of GASNet you can point the package at the root directory of the installation (also often know as the installation *prefix*). For example, to point the package at a version installed under `/opt/local` (*i.e., the include files are stored under `/opt/local/include` and libraries are in `/opt/local/lib`*) you would add `gasnet_root=/opt/local` to the command line.
# ROOT Recipe Notes

ROOT has a significant number of build options. Not all of them are supported by this package recipe at this time. Relevant notes on support (or lack thereof) for various options is below.

## Fixed and unsupported options

### Missing dependencies

The following configuration options are unsupported (set to `OFF`) due to missing dependencies:

#### `alien`

Requires `libgapiUI` from ALICE.

#### `gfal`

#### `monalisa`

Monitoring with Monalisa depends on `libapmoncpp`.

#### `odbc`

#### `tcmalloc`

#### `xinetd`

### Discontinued options

Support for several options was discontinued in ROOT without prior support in the recipe:

#### `afdsmgrd`

#### `afs`

#### `bonjour`

#### `castor`

#### `chirp`

#### `geocad`

#### `glite`

#### `globus`

#### `hdfs`

#### `ios`

#### `krb5`

#### `ldap`

#### `rfio`

#### `ruby`

#### `sapdb`

#### `srp`

### Other fixed or unsupported options

#### `arrow=OFF`

#### `asimage=ON`, `astiff=ON`, `builtin_afterimage=ON`

Full control of `asimage` and `astiff` would require a package recipe for libAfterImage or Afterstep. In their absence, we use the provided and internally built version of libAfterImage.

#### `ccache=OFF`

Only useful for repeated builds.

#### `cling=OFF`

The use of Cling is assumed.

#### `cxxmodules`

This option should not be confused with `runtime_cxxmodules`. `cxxmodules` is an optimization that affects only the efficiency of building ROOT.

#### `exceptions=ON`

Support for C++ exceptions is assumed.

#### `explicitlink=ON`

Use of explicit linking when making shared libraries is assumed.

#### `fail-on-missing=ON`

Failure on missing dependencies is assumed (_vs_ automatically setting `builtin_XXX`).

#### `gnuinstall=OFF`

GNU-compliant install layout.

#### `libcxx`

This option controls use of the libC++ standard C++ library via compiler options. It is set automatically by ROOT's configuration on macOS >=10.7 when a Clang compiler is configured. Due to complexities related to compiler options and the way a compiler might have been configured, configurable support is disabled until (at least) Spack supports the standard library as a virtual dependency.

#### `pch=ON`

The use of pre-compiled headers when building is assumed.

#### `roottest=OFF`

`roottest` requires access to the network.

#### `runtime_cxxmodules=OFF`

This option tells ROOT to generate and use PCMs for its own libraries. This functionality is experimental for ROOT < 6.20, and is currently not supported by the recipe.

#### `shared=ON`

The use of shared libraries is assumed.

#### `soversion=ON`

The use of versioning for shared libraries is assumed.

#### `testing`

The building of ROOT's test suite and its availability for use by CTest is pegged to Spack's determination of whether testing is required for the current installation procedure.

## Variants and version dependent support for options

Some configuration options are version dependent---unavailable before or after a specific version. The current accounting for such options in the recipe is far from exhaustive, and a survey of the various options and the versions that support them would be useful. However, accounting for them is somewhat clumsy absent a `when` clause for variants, or similar.

### Conflicting variants since 6.18

#### `memstat`

#### `qt4`

Representing the obsolete `qt` and `qtgsi` ROOT build options.

#### `table`

### Temporarily conflicting variants

## Permanently removed variants

The following variants have been removed from the recipe as they have always been ineffective:

* `avahi`
* `kerberos`
* `ldap`
* `libcxx`
* `odbc`
* `tiff`

In addition, the `test` variant has been removed as its actions are irrelevant to the installed source---the corresponding `testing` ROOT option is enabled if and only if `self.run_tests` is set.
