Solcore
=======

**Solcore** was born as a modular set of tools, written (almost) entirely in Python 3, to address some of the task we had to solve more. With time, however, it has evolved as a complete semiconductor solver able of modelling the optical and electrical properties of a wide range of solar cells, from quantum well devices to multi-junction solar cells.

Please, visit [Solcore\'s Documentation](http://docs.solcore.solar), the [Tutorial](docs/source/Examples/tutorial.rst) for a step-by-step example of how to use *Solcore* to model a solar cell and also check the [Examples folder](examples) for more specific information and examples of usage.

# Contributing to Solcore

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to Solcore!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Solcore, a multi-scale, Python-based library for the modelling of solar cells and semiconductor materials. The goal of these guidelines is to make the development of the package efficient and sustainable and to ensure that every commit makes it better, more readable, more robust and better documented. Please, feel free suggest changes and improvements. 

(this guide is based on the [Atom editor guide](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md))

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Solcore Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [the repository Administrator](mailto:d.alonso-alvarez@imperial.ac.uk).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Solcore. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](https://github.com/dalonsoa/solcore5/issues) (including the closed issues) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). 

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you installed Solcore and what you where trying to do.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **If there is any error output in the temrinal, include that output with your report.**

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Solcore) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Solcore?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of Solcore from [the releases page](https://github.com/dalonsoa/solcore5/releases).
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of Solcore are you using?** 
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **Are you running Solcore in a virtual machine?** If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?
* **If the problem is related with the Poisson-drift-diffusion solver**, which compiler did you use? What were the installation steps you followed?

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Solcore, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](https://github.com/dalonsoa/solcore5/issues) (including closed issues) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion).

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Solcore users, maybe including some links to scientific papers showing the enhancement in action.
* **List some other packages or applications where this enhancement exists.**
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues](https://github.com/dalonsoa/solcore5/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/dalonsoa/solcore5/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Solcore's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Solcore
- Enable a sustainable system for Solcore's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. **Describe clearly what is the purpose of the pull request**. Refer to the relevant issues on [Bugs](#reporting-bugs) or [Enhancements](#suggesting-enhancements). In general, an issue should always be open *prior* to a pull request, to discuss its contents with a maintainer and make sure it makes sense for Solcore. If the pull request is a work in progress that will take some time to be ready but still you want to discuss it with the community, open a [draft pull request](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/). 
2. **Include relevant unit tests and integration tests, where needed**. Solcore's test suite is quite limited at the moment. We are working to improve this and tests as many features as possible, so any new addition to the code must come with its own set of tests to avoid going backwards in this matter.   
3. **For new features and enhancements, include documentation and examples**. Both in the code, as docstrings in classes, functions and modules, and as proper documentation describing how to use the new feature. 
4. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
5. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

# Fortran Compilers

In order to use the Poisson-Drift-diffusion solver, it will be necessary to have a suitable fortran compiler installed and correctly configured in your system. After that, you do not need to worry about the compilation process: it is done automatically by the installation script. 

## Linux

Most linux systems have a Fortran compiler already installed, typically part of GCC, the GNU compiler collection. If not, you will need to check how to install it for your particular linux distribution. 

## Mac OS X

For Mac OS X we have used the *gfortran* compiler installed together with GCC using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), a MacOS package manager.  

```brew install gcc```

Other package managers like [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) or [Fink](http://www.finkproject.org) might also work, but we have not tried. 

## Windows

To get a Fortran compiler properly working under Windows with F2Py, we have followed the [detailed instructions written by Michael Hirsch](https://www.scivision.co/f2py-running-fortran-code-in-python-on-windows/). Read Michael Hirsch's instructions in full for a complete picture, but the important bits are:

1. Install [MSYS2 and MinGW](https://www.scivision.co/install-msys2-windows)

	Follow the instructions there to update all packages and to setup your environment.

2. Install the fortran compiler executing from the PowerShell:

	```bash
	pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-fortran
	````
    
3. Tell Python to use MinGW: create file ```~/pydistutils.cfg``` containing:

    ```
    [build]
    compiler=mingw32
    ```
	
	You can do this executing in the PowerShell
	
	```bash
	echo "[build]`ncompiler=mingw32" | Out-File -Encoding ASCII ~/pydistutils.cfg
	````

And that should be it. With this, your will be able to call the gfortran compiler from the Windows terminal and also the Solcore installer should be able to find it. You can try installing Solcore itself or with the *lowtran* package described in the instructions by [Michael Hirsch](https://www.scivision.co/f2py-running-fortran-code-in-python-on-windows/). Solcore on Windows 10
=====================
The Python part of Solcore, which is the majority, should work under Windows with no problems. However, we have found a lot trouble trying to make the parts and complements that require compilation to work properly (the PDD solver, S4, SMARTS and SPICE). For those who need to use those tools, please follow the instructions below. 

Installing Solcore
------------------
(thanks Phoebe!)

After a lot of effort, we have Solcore fully up and running in Windows 10... more or less, using the Ubuntu shell that comes with Windows 10. To install Solcore there, follow this steps:

All steps on fresh install of Ubuntu (using the Ubuntu terminal on
Windows 10 distributed by Canonical Group, Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS, Codename:
xenial)

-  Install git if not done already
-  Install python 3.x if not already done
-  Install pip3 (for installing Python3 packages; you may need to update the package list first: sudo apt-get update)::

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
- You need LAPACK and BLAS libraries linked to the -llapack and -lblas library flags – these are used for scipy and S4. The developers of S4 recommend OpenBLAS (you can find installation instructions by Googling), but this also works and is simpler:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev
```

-  Install matplotlib (and tk, otherwise get an error later):
    
```bash
pip3 install matplotlib
sudo apt-get install python3-tk 
```

-  Other dependencies install automatically & successfully when
      installing Solcore5... hopefully.

-  Now, we actually Install Solcore::

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dalonsoa/solcore5.git
cd solcore5
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

Installing S4
-------------

-  The “make” command must be available:

```bash
sudo apt install make
```

-  You must use the fork of S4 at https://github.com/phoebe-p/S4; the
      main branch is not compatible with Python 3.x:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phoebe-p/S4.git
cd S4
make S4_pyext
```

Checking if everything works 
--------------------------

- To see if the PDD is working:

```bash
python3
>>> import solcore.solar_cell_solver
```

-  Run tests:

```bash
sudo python3 setup.py test
```

This might result in an error saying that quantum mechanics failed because 5\ :sup:`th` decimal place of result doesn’t match. Simply, ignore it.

- Other information:
    - gcc/g++/gfortran versions used here: gcc version 5.4.0 20160609 (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.6)

    -  If everything is working correctly, should be able to import
      solcore.solar_cell_solver without getting warnings about the RCWA
      solver or PDD.

    -  Sometimes, an issue arises with the SOPRA database (and occasionally
   importing solar_cell_solver?) where the permissions are set such that
   you cannot access the database – running sudo python3, or sudo
   [whatever python editor you’re using] fixes this.

Installing SMARTS Windows10/Ubuntu Shell 
----------------------------------------
(thanks Andrew!)

* Register and download SMARTS FOR MAC from http://www.nrel.gov/rredc/smarts/    Yes, we are going to use a Mac software on Windows. Hold on tight.
* Move the SMARTS_xxx_Mac.tar.gz file from Windows to the dedicated Ubuntu folder (e.g. ~$ mv /mnt/c/Users/Andrew/Downloads ~/)
* Unpack the file (~$ tar zxf SMARTS_xxx_Mac.tar.gz)
* The executable script "smarts295.command" in the folder won't work (try running ~$ ./smarts295.command). For example on 64bit Windows the following error is thrown, requiring the source to be recompiled:

```
Source_code/smarts295_cmd: 1: Source_code/smarts295_cmd: dJ: not found
Source_code/smarts295_cmd: 1: Source_code/smarts295_cmd: ȅ8__PAGEZERO__TEXT: not found
Source_code/smarts295_cmd: 1: Source_code/smarts295_cmd: Syntax error: word unexpected (expecting ")")
```

#### Recompiling SMARTS   

* Move to the directory /SMARTS_295_Mac/Source_code/
* Delete the file "smarts295_cmd" (type ~$ rm smarts_cmd). This will need to be recompiled on for your CPU architecture
* Assuming you have gfortran installed (either as part of Anaconda or another third party distribution) you should compile smarts (type ~$ gfortran smarts295.f) which results in an executable called "a.out"
	* N.B. Although the SMARTS documentation suggests changing some flags in the source code you _should not modify_ the SMARTS source code.  Solcore expects the default behaviour with respect to batch mode and file overwrites.  
* Rename the file "a.out" to "smarts295_cmd". Now SMARTS has been recompiled for your CPU architecture.
* IMPORTANT FOR WINDOWS: Solcore on Windows10/Ubuntu looks for the script called "smarts295", instead of "smarts295.command", due to different naming systems in Linux and Mac. Rename "smarts295.command" to just "smarts295".
* You can test the installation of SMARTS using the example file Figure8.py
* Please note that running SMARTS from the command line (typing ~$ ./smarts295) will produce two text files, "smarts295.ext.txt" and "smarts295.out.txt".
   If these are in the SMARTS root folder, they will mess up running SMARTS on Solcore. If you do run SMARTS in the command line, remove these files when you are done.

Solcore on Mac OS X
=====================

Solcore has been heavely tested under Mac OS X, so there should be no problems. However, using NGSPICE requires some details, as shown below.

Installing NGSpice on MacOSX
----------------------------

* Download NGSpice from 
[http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/download.html](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/download.html)
* Installing the binary package on mac os X will result in the executable residing in ```/Applications/ngspice/bin/ngspice```
* You an set the path using 
``` `\>\>\>import solcore.config\_tools as config
> > > config.set_location_of_spice('/Applications/ngspice/bin/ngspice')


* If NG spice throws an error
``` `dyld: Library not loaded: /opt/X11/lib/libXaw.7.dylib```
`* then you will likely need to install xquartz.  It can be downloaded from from [https://www.xquartz.org](https://www.xquartz.org)
	* run the installer and restart the computer.
* You can test the NGSpice installation using Example\_PV\_module.py
