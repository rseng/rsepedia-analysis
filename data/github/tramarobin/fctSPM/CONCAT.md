# fctSnPM [![DOI](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03159/status.svg)](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.03159) [![View fctSnPM on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/77945-fctSnPM)
Using spm1d package (v.0.4.3), computes ANOVA and post-hoc tests from anova1 to anova3rm, with a non-parametric approach (permutation tests).
The type of ANOVA (if required) and post-hoc tests are chosen regarding the independent or repeated measure effects given in parameters.
The function automatically adapts to 1D and 2D data.

The general usage is:
```matlab
snpmAnalysis=fctSnPM(data, independantEffects, repeatedMeasuresEffects, varargin)
```

## Warnings ##
* Unbalanced two- and three-way repeated-measures ANOVA results have not been verified. Please refer to the [spm1d documentation about unbalanced design](https://spm1d.org/DocumentationMatlab.html#label-documentationmatlab)
* Post-hoc tests with Bonferonni correction are only approximate and conservative. Refer to the [spm1d documentation about post hoc tests](https://spm1d.org/doc/PostHoc/anova.html) for more information.
* Some warnings are displayed if the number of permutations is automatically modified or not sufficient to perform the analysis with the defined alpha risk.
* Effect sizes and confidence intervals are not validated and are just given as supplementary information.
* For more information, please visit the [smp1d documentation](https://spm1d.org/Documentation.html)


### Caution ###
* For `independantEffects` and `repeatedMeasuresEffects`, avoid underscore (_) or minus (-) signs. Spaces are OK. It affects the recognition of sub-data for the multiples comparisons 
* Use '/' when indicating a saving directory (`savedir` option)
* Once you are ok with the created figure, increase the number of permutations (`multiPerm` or `Perm` options) to achieve numerical stability. 1000 permutations are a good start but if your hardware allows it, the more is the better


## Statement of need ##
Most of physiological data measured during human movement are continuous and expressed in function of time. 
However, researchers predominantly analyze extracted scalar values from the continuous measurement, as the mean, the maximum, the amplitude, or the integrated value over the time. 
Analyzing continuous values (i.e., time series) can provide more information than extracted indicators, as the later discards one dimension of the data among the magnitude and localization in time. 
In addition, oscillatory signals such as muscle vibrations and electromyograms contain information in the temporal and frequency domains. 
Once again, scalar analysis reduces the information at only one dimension by discarding two dimensions among the magnitude and the localization in the time and/or frequency domain.

Factorial SnPM (fctSnPM) allows MATLAB users to create figures of 1D and [2D SnPM](https://spm1d.org/doc/Stats2D/ex2d_matlab.html) analysis for ANOVA and post-hoc designs.
The statistical analysis is also saved in `.mat` files.   
This function synthetizes the main and interaction effects to display only the significant post-hoc regarding the results of the ANOVA.   
For post-hoc for interaction effects, the main effect is also displayed if located elsewhere than the interaction effect.

Each effect is also display on a specific figure in `.TIF` format named after `effectNames`, a floder named FIG is also created and contains the figures in `.fig` format.   
For 1D:  The curve represents the `Fcontinuum`, the horizontal line is the `Fthreshold`, the highlighted parts of the curve in blue represents the significant cluster(s), and the vertical lines are the start and end indexes.
For 2D: The map represents the `Fcontinuum`, with a colorbar maximum at `Fthreshold`, the white clusters represent the significant clusters.

#### Post Hoc ####
This folder contains additional folders (0 (for anova1), 3 (for anova2) or 7 (for anova3)) that contain figures and metrics representing the different post-hoc tests.  

Interaction folders (AxB or AxBxC) contain 2 or 3 folders in which one effect is investigated.

##### In one dimension #####
A total of 5 figures with the name of the effect represent the means and standard deviations between subject for each condition (grouped in function of the effect investigated).  
Under this plot, a second graph display the result of the ANOVA (or ANOVAs for interaction) and the significant post-hoc tests for pairwise comparisons.  
The differences between the 5 figures are the representation of the ANOVA and the disposition of the statistical analysis (subplot or same plot, see optional inputs)

* `saveNplot` permits to save and plot the entire analysis obtain with `fctSnPM` and `fctSnPMS`.  

The general use of these funtions are:
```matlab
snpmAnalysis=fctSnPMS(data, independantEffects, repeatedMeasuresEffects, 'Optional Input Name', value)
onlyPlot(snpmAnalysis,'Optional Input Name', value)
saveNplot(snpmAnalysis,'Optional Input Name', value)
```
You can use `onlyPlot` to have an insight on the figures before saving to adjust the plot parameters.  
It may be useful to use `saveNplot` when a 2D analysis is performed, it may permit to redo quickly figures without the long time of analysis.

# Summary
Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) is a statistical method originally used in neuroimaging developed in the early 90's in biomedical imaging, allowing to determine which brain zones were solicited during a functional MRI [@Friston:1995]. Originally developed for a three dimensional analysis, the application of this method to the analysis of vectors or matrices was made possible thanks to @Pataky:2010 whom allows to perform statistical inference on curves (vectors - 1D) or maps (matrices - 2D).

As in "classical" statistics on scalar values (0D), there is a parametric and a non-parametric approach to the SPM method. While the parametric method is based on random gaussian fields, the non-parametric method is based on label permutation tests [@Nichols:2002], and thus, on re-sampling and randomness to make statistical inference. The main advantage of the non-parametric approach is that a gaussian distribution of the data is not required, making possible it to work with both curves and maps.

# Statement of need
Most of physiological data measured during human movement are continuous and expressed in function of time. However, researchers predominantly analyze extracted scalar values from the continuous measurement, as the mean, the maximum, the amplitude, or the integrated value over the time. Analyzing continuous values (i.e., time series) can provide more information than extracted indicators, as the later discards one dimension of the data among the magnitude and localization in time. In addition, oscillatory signals such as muscle vibrations and electromyograms contain information in the temporal and frequency domains. However, scalar analysis reduces the information at only one dimension by discarding two dimensions among the magnitude and the localization in the time and/or frequency domain.

To analyze all the dimensions of a signal without losing information, the analysis of curves or maps was proposed, coded, and put online by Pataky. However, the use of the proposed functions does not allow the analysis of 2D data automatically. Moreover, a rather frequent error is to consider only the significance of the last statistical test performed and not the intersection between the post-hoc tests and the ANOVA. Indeed, a difference between two samples can be significant if, and only if the ANOVA is significant in the same areas. The spm1d package, redistributed with fctSnPM at `./fctSnPM/src/spm1d_Pataky` is [published elsewhere](https://github.com/0todd0000/spm1dmatlab), and thus is not part of this JOSS review.

# fctSnPM
The function we propose meets two objectives. 1/ to allow statistical inferences on curves and maps with a standardized format and 2/ to simplify analyses by comparing means while considering intersections with tests performed upstream (ANOVA and post-hoc of main effects).

The statistical tests are performed taking into account the independent and repeated measure effects provided in the obligatory function inputs. ANOVA, up to three-way ANOVA with three repeated measures, is performed if required, and followed by post-hoc tests as paired or independent Student t-tests. By default, the ANOVA is performed with an alpha risk of 5%, while post-hoc tests alpha risk is adjusted with Bonferronni correction. A number of 10/alpha permutations (200 for a 5% risk) is defined for each test. Statistical parameters are customizable via optional inputs, like `multiPerm` which can be used to increase the number of permutations and achieve numerical stability and reliable analysis [@Nichols:2002]. A Matlab (.mat) file containing the number of permutations, the significant clusters, the statistical thresholds, and the raw data used in the analysis is also generated for each test family.

To interpret the results, figures directly usable for presentations and/or articles are available. In one dimension, the main figure contains the mean and standard deviations for each group of the analyzed condition, and the results of the post-hoc tests corrected with the result of the ANOVA. In two dimensions, the mean maps and the standard deviations are on two separate figures, and the result of the statistical analysis is displayed on the map of differences between two modalities. Therewith, other figures that display absolute and relative differences, effect sizes, and the raw value of the statistical test and its threshold are available.

To personalize the figures, Matlab (.fig) files are implemented to perform a posteriori modifications, and optional inputs are available to a priori customize the figures. These parameters are gathered in three categories: 1/ general plot parameters working identically for one and two dimensions, acting on axis labels and limits, image resolution and size 2/ one dimension parameters that act on the characteristics of the curves like color and transparency, or the position of the statistical analysis relatively to curves 3/ two dimensions parameters acting on the colormap and its limits, as well as the color of the statistical test displayed on map of differences. 

This function was already used in @Trama:2020 to compare soft-tissue and muscle vibrations of the *vastus lateralis*. It is currently used to assess modifications of soft-tissue vibrations caused by mountain ultra-marathons, the effect of the pedaling phase on *quadriceps* soft-tissue vibrations, and differences in isokinetic torque after ACL operation and rehabilitation.
