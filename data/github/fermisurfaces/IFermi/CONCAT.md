IFermi is a Python (3.6+) library and set of command-line tools for the generation,
analysis, and visualisation of Fermi surfaces and Fermi slices. The goal of the library
is to provide fully featured FermiSurface and FermiSlice objects that allow for easy
manipulation and analysis. The main features include:

- Interpolation of electronic band structures onto dense k-point meshes.
- Extraction of Fermi surfaces and Fermi slices from electronic band structures.
- Projection of arbitrary properties onto Fermi surfaces and Fermi slices.
- Tools to calculate Fermi surface dimensionality, orientation, and averaged projections,
  including Fermi velocities.
- Interactive visualisation of Fermi surfaces and slices, with support for
  [mayavi](https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/), [plotly](https://plot.ly/) and
  [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org).
- Generation and visualisation of spin-texture.

IFermi's command-line tools only work with VASP calculations but support for additional
DFT packages will be added in the future.

## Quick start

The [online documentation](https://fermisurfaces.github.io/IFermi/cli.html) provides a full
description of the available command-line options.

### Analysis

Fermi surface properties, including dimensionality and orientation can be extracted
from a vasprun.xml file using:

```bash
ifermi info --property velocity
```

```
Fermi Surface Summary

```

### Visualisation

Three-dimensional Fermi surfaces can be visualized from a `vasprun.xml` file using:

```bash
ifermi plot
```

The two-dimensional slice of a Fermi surface along the plane specified by the miller
indices (j k l) and distance d can be plotted from a `vasprun.xml` file using:

```bash
ifermi plot --slice j k l d
```

### Python library

The `ifermi` command line tools are build on the IFermi Python library. Here is an
example of how to load DFT calculation outputs, interpolate the energies onto a dense mesh,
generate a Fermi surface, calculate Fermi surface properties, and visualise the surface.
A more complete summary of the API is given in the [API introduction page](https://fermisurfaces.github.io/IFermi/introduction_to_ifermi.html)
and in the [API Reference page](https://fermisurfaces.github.io/IFermi/ifermi.html) in the documentation.

```python
from pymatgen.io.vasp.outputs import Vasprun
from ifermi.surface import FermiSurface
from ifermi.interpolate import FourierInterpolator
from ifermi.plot import FermiSlicePlotter, FermiSurfacePlotter, save_plot, show_plot
from ifermi.kpoints import kpoints_from_bandstructure

# load VASP calculation outputs
vr = Vasprun("vasprun.xml")
bs = vr.get_band_structure()

# interpolate the energies onto a dense k-point mesh
interpolator = FourierInterpolator(bs)
dense_bs, velocities = interpolator.interpolate_bands(return_velocities=True)

# generate the Fermi surface and calculate the dimensionality
fs = FermiSurface.from_band_structure(
  dense_bs, mu=0.0, wigner_seitz=True, calculate_dimensionality=True
)

# generate the Fermi surface and calculate the group velocity at the
# center of each triangular face
dense_kpoints = kpoints_from_bandstructure(dense_bs)
fs = FermiSurface.from_band_structure(
  dense_bs, mu=0.0, wigner_seitz=True, calculate_dimensionality=True,
  property_data=velocities, property_kpoints=dense_kpoints
)

# number of isosurfaces in the Fermi surface
fs.n_surfaces

# number of isosurfaces for each Spin channel
fs.n_surfaces_per_spin

# the total area of the Fermi surface
fs.area

# the area of each isosurface
fs.area_surfaces

# loop over all isosurfaces and check their properties
# the isosurfaces are given as a list for each spin channel
for spin, isosurfaces in fs.isosurfaces.items():
    for isosurface in isosurfaces:
        # the dimensionality (does the surface cross periodic boundaries)
        isosurface.dimensionality

        # what is the orientation
        isosurface.orientation

        # does the surface have face properties
        isosurface.has_properties

        # calculate the norms of the properties
        isosurface.properties_norms

        # calculate scalar projection of properties on to [0 0 1] vector
        isosurface.scalar_projection((0, 0, 1))

        # uniformly sample the surface faces to a consistent density
        isosurface.sample_uniform(0.1)

# plot the Fermi surface
fs_plotter = FermiSurfacePlotter(fs)
plot = fs_plotter.get_plot()

# generate Fermi slice along the (0 0 1) plane going through the Œì-point.
fermi_slice = fs.get_fermi_slice((0, 0, 1))

# number of isolines in the slice
fermi_slice.n_lines

# do the lines have segment properties
fermi_slice.has_properties

# plot slice
slice_plotter = FermiSlicePlotter(fermi_slice)
plot = slice_plotter.get_plot()

save_plot(plot, "fermi-slice.png")  # saves the plot to a file
show_plot(plot)  # displays an interactive plot
```

## Summary

Include a summary of major changes in bullet points:

* Feature 1
* Feature 2
* Fix 1
* Fix 2

## Additional dependencies introduced (if any)

* List all new dependencies needed and justify why. While adding dependencies that bring
significantly useful functionality is perfectly fine, adding ones that
add trivial functionality, e.g., to use one single easily implementable
function, is frowned upon. Provide a justification why that dependency is needed.
Especially frowned upon are circular dependencies, e.g., depending on derivative
modules of pymatgen such as custodian or Fireworks.

## TODO (if any)

If this is a work-in-progress, write something about what else needs
to be done

* Feature 1 supports A, but not B.

## Checklist

Work-in-progress pull requests are encouraged, but please put [WIP]
in the pull request title.

Before a pull request can be merged, the following items must be checked:

- [ ] Code is in the [standard Python style](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). The easiest way to handle this
      is to run the following in the **correct sequence** on your local machine. Start with running
      [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) on your new code. This will automatically reformat
      your code to PEP8 conventions and removes most issues. Then run
      [pycodestyle](https://pycodestyle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), followed by
      [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/).
- [ ] Docstrings have been added in the [Google docstring format](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).
      Run [pydocstyle](http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/2.1.1/index.html) on your code.
- [ ] Type annotations are **highly** encouraged. Run [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) to type check your code.
- [ ] Tests have been added for any new functionality or bug fixes.
- [ ] All linting and tests pass.

Note that the CI system will run all the above checks. But it will be much more efficient if you already fix most
errors prior to submitting the PR. It is highly recommended that you use the pre-commit hook provided in the pymatgen
repository. Simply `cp pre-commit .git/hooks` and a check will be run prior to allowing commits.

``ifermi`` program
==================

IFermi includes command-line tools for generating, analysing, and plotting Fermi
surfaces. The tools can be accessed using the ``ifermi`` command-line program.
All of the options provided in the command-line are also accessible using the
`Python API <plotting_using_python.html>`_.

IFermi works in 4 stages:

1. It loads a band structure from DFT calculation outputs.
2. It interpolates the band structure onto a dense k-point mesh using Fourier
   interpolation as implemented in `BoltzTraP2 <https://gitlab.com/sousaw/BoltzTraP2>`_.
3. It extracts the Fermi surface at a given energy level.
4. It extracts information about the Fermi surface or plots it using several
   plotting backends.

.. NOTE::

    Currently, IFermi's command-line tools only work with VASP calculation outputs.
    Support for additional DFT packages will be added in a future release.

IFermi is controlled on the command-line using the ``ifermi`` command. The available
options can be listed using:

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi -h

Information on the Fermi surface area, dimensionality,
and orientation can be extracted using the ``info`` subcommand.
The only input required is a vasprun.xml. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi info

An example output for MgB\ :sub:`2` is shown below:

.. code-block:: md

    Fermi Surface Summary

    Isosurfaces

           6         1.944         2D           (0, 0, 1)
           7         4.370         1D           (0, 0, 1)
           7         2.961         2D           (0, 0, 1)
           8         3.549         1D           (0, 0, 1)
           8         3.549         1D           (0, 0, 1)


If properties are included in the Fermi surface (see :ref:`property-gen`), the averaged
property values will also be calculated. This allows for calculation of the Fermi
velocity. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi info --property velocity

.. code-block:: md

Fermi surfaces and slices can be visualised using the ``plot`` subcommand. Again, the
only input required is a vasprun.xml file. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi plot

The two subcommands ``info`` and ``plot`` share many of the same options
which we describe below.

Generation options
------------------

There are several options affect the generation of Fermi surfaces from *ab initio*
calculation outputs. These options are available for both the ``info`` and ``plot``
subcommands.

Input file
~~~~~~~~~~

IFermi will look for a vasprun.xml or vasprun.xml.gz file in the current directory.
To specify a particular vasprun file the ``--filename`` (or ``-f`` for short) option
can be used:

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi plot --filename my_vasprun.xml

Interpolation factor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The band structure extracted from the vasprun must be processed before the Fermi
surface can be generated. The two key issues are:

1. It may only contain the irreducible portion of the Brillouin zone (if symmetry was
   used in the calculation) and therefore may not contain enough information to plot
   the Fermi surface across the full reciprocal lattice.
2. It may have been calculated on a relatively coarse k-point mesh and will therefore
   produce a rather jagged Fermi surface.

Both issues can be solved by interpolating the band structure onto a denser k-point
mesh. This is achieved by using `BoltzTraP2 <https://gitlab.com/sousaw/BoltzTraP2>`_
to Fourier interpolate the eigenvalues onto a denser mesh that covers the full
Brillouin zone.

The degree of interpolation is controlled by the ``--interpolation-factor`` (``-i``)
argument. A value of 8 (the default value), roughly indicates that the interpolated band
structure will contain 8x as many k-points. Increasing the interpolation factor will
result in smoother Fermi surfaces. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi plot --interpolation-factor 10

.. WARNING::

    As the interpolation increases, the generation of the Fermi surface, analysis and
    plotting will take a longer time and can result in large file sizes.

Fermi surface energy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The energy level offset at which the Fermi surface is calculated is controlled by the
``--mu`` option. The energy level is given relative to the Fermi level of the VASP
calculation and is given in eV. By default, the Fermi surface is calculated at
``mu = 0``, i.e., at the Fermi level.

For gapped materials, ``mu`` must be selected so that it falls within the
conduction or valence bands otherwise no Fermi surface will be obtained. For
example. The following command will generate the Fermi surface at 1 eV above the Fermi
level:

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi plot --mu 1


.. _property-gen:

Property projections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional properties, such as the group velocity and orbital magnetisation (spin
texture), can be projected onto the Fermi surface using the ``--property`` option. The
group velocities are calculated during Fourier interpolation (units of m/s) and can be
included in the Fermi surface using:

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi plot --property velocity


For calculations performed using spin‚Äìorbit coupling or non-collinear magnetism, the
spin magnetisation can be projected onto the Fermi surface using:

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi plot --property spin

.. WARNING::

    Projecting the spin magnetisation requires the k-point mesh to cover the entire
    Brillouin zone. I.e., the DFT calculation must have been performed without symmetry
    (``ISYM = - 1`` in VASP).

It is possible to calculate the scalar projection of the the Fermi surface properties
onto a cartesian axis using the ``--projection-axis`` option.. For example, to use the
scalar projection of the spin magnetisation onto the [0 0 1] cartesian direction:

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi plot --property spin --projection-axis 0 0 1

Reciprocal space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the Wigner‚ÄìSeitz cell is used to contain to the Fermi surface. The
parallelepiped reciprocal lattice cell can be used instead by selecting the
``--no-wigner`` option. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi plot --no-wigner


Visualisation options
---------------------

In addition to the options for generating Fermi surfaces, there are several options
that control the visualisation parameters. These options are only available for the
``plot`` subcommand.

Plotting backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IFermi supports multiple plotting backends. The default is to the
`plotly <http://plotly.com>`_ package but `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org>`_ and
`mayavi <https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/>`_ are also supported.

.. NOTE::

    The mayavi dependencies are not installed by default. To use this backend, follow
    the installation instructions `here <https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/installation.html>`_
    and then install IFermi using ``pip install ifermi[mayavi]``.

Different plotting packages can be specified using the ``--type`` option (``-t``). For
example, to use matplotlib:

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi plot --type matplotlib

Output files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, IFermi generates interactive plots. To generate static images, an output
file can be specified using the ``--output`` (``-o``) option. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi plot --output fermi-surface.jpg

.. NOTE::

    Saving graphical output files with the plotly backend requires plotly-orca to be
    installed.

Running the above command in the ``examples/MgB2`` directory produces the plot:

.. image:: _static/fs-1.jpg
    :height: 250px
    :align: center

Interactive plots can be saved to a html file using the plotly backend by specifying
a html filename. This will prevent the plot from being opened automatically.

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi plot --output fermi-surface.html

Selecting spin channels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the plot above, the spins are degenerate (the Hamiltonian does not differentiate
between the up and down spins). This is why the surface looks dappled, IFermi
is plotting two redundant surfaces. To stop it from doing this, we can specify that
only one spin component should be plotted using the ``--spin`` option. The default
is to plot both spins but a single spin channel can be selected through the names
"up" and "down". For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi plot --spin up

.. image:: _static/fs-spin-up.jpg
    :height: 250px
    :align: center


Changing the viewpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The viewpoint (camera angle) can be changed using the ``--azimuth`` (``-a``) and
``--elevation`` (``-e``) options. This will change both the initial viewpoint
for interactive plots, and the final viewpoint for static plots. To summarize:

- The azimuth is the angle subtended by the viewpoint position vector on a sphere
  projected onto the x-y plane in degrees. The default is 45¬∞.
- The elevation (or zenith) is the angle subtended by the viewpoint position vector and
  the z-axis. The default is 35¬∞.

The viewpoint always directed to the center of the the Fermi surface (position [0 0 0]).
As an example, the viewpoint could be changed using:

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi plot --azimuth 120 --elevation 5

.. image:: _static/fs-viewpoint.jpg
    :height: 250px
    :align: center

.. _prop-style:

Styling face properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As described in the :ref:`property-gen` section, Fermi surfaces (and Fermi slices)
can include a property projected onto the isosurface faces. By default, if properties
are included in the Fermi surface they will be indicated by coloring of the isosurface.
If the face property is a vector, the norm of the vector will be used as the
color intensity. The colormap of the surface can be changed using the
``--property-colormap`` option. All `matplotlib colormaps <https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/colormap_reference.html>`_
are supported. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi plot --property velocity --property-colormap viridis

.. image:: _static/fs-velocity.jpg
    :height: 250px
    :align: center

The minimum and maximum values for the colorbar limits can be set using the ``--cmin``
and ``--cmax`` parameters. These should be used when quantitatively comparing surface
properties between two plots. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi plot --property velocity --cmin 0 --cmax 5

As described above, it is also possible calculate the scalar projection of the
face properties onto a cartesian axis using the ``--projection-axis`` option. When
combined with a diverging colormap this can be used to indicate surface properties that
vary between positive and negative numbers. For example, below we color the Fermi
surface of MgB2 by the projection of the group velocity onto the [0 0 1] vector (z-axis).

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi plot --property velocity --projection-axis 0 0 1 --property-colormap RdBu


.. image:: _static/fs-velocity-projection.jpg
    :height: 250px
    :align: center

Vector valued Fermi surface properties (such as group velocity or spin
magnetisation) can also be visualised as arrows using the ``--vector-property`` option.
If ``--projection-axis`` is set, the color of the arrows will be determined by the
scalar projection of the property vectors onto the specified axis, otherwise the norm
of the projections will be used. The colormap used to color the arrows is specified
using ``--vector-colormap``. Lastly, often it is useful to hide the isosurface
(``--hide-surface`` option) or high-symmetry labels (``-hide-labels``)
when visualising arrows. An example of how to combine these options is given below:

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi plot --property velocity --projection-axis 0 0 1 --property-colormap RdBu \
                --vector-property --vector-colormap RdBu --hide-surface --hide-labels


.. image:: _static/fs-velocity-arrow.jpg
    :height: 250px
    :align: center

The size of the arrows can be controlled using the ``--vnorm`` parameter. This is
particularly useful when quantitatively comparing vector properties across multiple
Fermi surfaces. A larger ``vnorm`` value will increase the size of the arrows.
The spacing between the arrows is controlled by the ``--vector-spacing`` option. Smaller
values will increase the density of the arrows.

Fermi slices
~~~~~~~~~~~~

IFermi can also generate two-dimensional slices of the Fermi surface along a specified
plane using the ``--slice`` option. Planes are defined by their miller indices (a b c)
and a distance from the plane, d. Most of the above options also apply to to Fermi slices,
however, slices are always plotted using matplotlib as the backend.

For example, a slice through the (0 0 1) plane that passes through the center of the
Brillouin zone (Œì-point) can be generated using:

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi plot --slice 0 0 1 0

.. image:: _static/slice.png
    :height: 250px
    :align: center

Slices can contain segment properties in the same way that surfaces can contain face
properties. To style slices with projections see :ref:`prop-style`.
When including arrows in Fermi slice figures, only the components of the
arrows in the 2D plane will be shown. As an example below we plot the spin texture of
BiSb (``examples/BiSb``) with and without arrows. The spin texture is colored by the
projection of the spin onto the [0 0 1] cartesian direction.

Without arrows:


.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi plot --mu -0.85  -i 10 --slice 0 0 1 0 --property spin --hide-cell \
                --hide-labels --projection-axis 0 1 0 --property-colormap RdBu

.. image:: _static/slice-property.png
    :height: 250px
    :align: center

With arrows:

.. code-block:: bash

    ifermi plot --mu -0.85  -i 10 --slice 0 0 1 0 --property spin --hide-cell \
                --hide-labels --projection-axis 0 1 0 --property-colormap RdBu \
                --vector-property --vector-colormap RdBu --vnorm 5 --vector-spacing 0.025

.. image:: _static/slice-arrows.png
    :height: 250px
    :align: center

.. WARNING::

    When generating spin texture plots for small regions of k-space, for example,
    in a small area around the Œì-point, it is often necessary to increase the k-point
    mesh density of the underlying DFT calculation. In the example above, the DFT
    calculation was performed on a 21x21x21 k-point mesh.

    Furthermore, projecting the spin magnetisation requires the k-point mesh to cover
    the entire Brillouin zone. I.e., the DFT calculation must have been performed
    without symmetry (``ISYM = - 1`` in VASP).
