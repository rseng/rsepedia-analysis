# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities


Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement


Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting Thomas Mansencal and Michael Mauderer via email at thomas@colour-science.org and michael@colour-science.org respectively. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.

## Attribution

This page describes some advanced usage scenarios of **Colour**.

.. contents:: Table of Contents
    :local:
    :depth: 3

Environment
-----------

Various environment variables can be used to modify **Colour** behaviour at
runtime:

-   `COLOUR_SCIENCE__FLOAT_PRECISION`: Sets the float precision for most of
    **Colour** computations. Possible values are `float16`, `float32` and
    `float64` (default). Changing float precision might result in various
    **Colour** `functionality breaking entirely <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/6860>`__.
    *With great power comes great responsibility*.
-   `COLOUR_SCIENCE__INT_PRECISION`: Sets the integer precision for most of
    **Colour** computations. Possible values are `int8`, `int16`, `int32`,
    and `int64` (default). Changing integer precision
    *will almost certainly break* **Colour**!
    *With great power comes great responsibility*.
-   `COLOUR_SCIENCE__COLOUR__SHOW_WARNINGS_WITH_TRACEBACK`: results in the
    :func:`warnings.showwarning` definition to be replaced with the
    :func:`colour.utilities.show_warning` definition and thus providing
    complete traceback from the point where the warning occurred.

Caching
-------

**Colour** uses various internal caches to improve speed and prevent redundant
processes, notably for spectral related computations.

The internal caches are managed with the `colour.utilities.CACHE_REGISTRY`
cache registry object:

.. code-block:: python

    import colour

    print(colour.utilities.CACHE_REGISTRY)

.. code-block:: text

    {'colour.colorimetry.spectrum._CACHE_RESHAPED_SDS_AND_MSDS': '0 item(s)',
     'colour.colorimetry.tristimulus_values._CACHE_LAGRANGE_INTERPOLATING_COEFFICIENTS': '0 '
                                                                                         'item(s)',
     'colour.colorimetry.tristimulus_values._CACHE_SD_TO_XYZ': '0 item(s)',
     'colour.colorimetry.tristimulus_values._CACHE_TRISTIMULUS_WEIGHTING_FACTORS': '0 '
                                                                                   'item(s)',
     'colour.quality.cfi2017._CACHE_TCS_CIE2017': '0 item(s)',
     'colour.volume.macadam_limits._CACHE_OPTIMAL_COLOUR_STIMULI_XYZ': '0 item(s)',
     'colour.volume.macadam_limits._CACHE_OPTIMAL_COLOUR_STIMULI_XYZ_TRIANGULATIONS': '0 '
                                                                                      'item(s)',
     'colour.volume.spectrum._CACHE_OUTER_SURFACE_XYZ': '0 item(s)',
     'colour.volume.spectrum._CACHE_OUTER_SURFACE_XYZ_POINTS': '0 item(s)'}

See `colour.utilities.CacheRegistry` class documentation for more information
on how to manage the cache registry.

Using Colour without Scipy
--------------------------

With the release of `Colour 0.3.8 <https://github.com/colour-science/colour/releases/tag/v0.3.8>`__,
`SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`__ became a requirement.

**Scipy** is notoriously hard to compile, especially
`on Windows <https://colour-science.slack.com/messages/C02KH93GT/>`__.
Some Digital Content Creation (DCC) applications are shipping Python interpreters
compiled with versions of
`Visual Studio <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/>`__ such as 2011 or 2015.
Those are incompatible with the Python Wheels commonly built with
`Visual Studio 2008 (Python 2.7) or Visual Studio 2017 (Python 3.6) <https://devguide.python.org/setup/?highlight=windows#windows>`__.

It is however possible to use **Colour** in a partially broken state and mock
**Scipy** by using the `mock_for_colour.py <https://github.com/colour-science/colour/tree/develop/utilities>`__
module.

Assuming it is available for import, a typical usage would be as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    import sys
    from mock_for_colour import MockModule

    for module in ('scipy', 'scipy.interpolate', 'scipy.linalg',
                   'scipy.ndimage', 'scipy.ndimage.filters', 'scipy.spatial',
                   'scipy.spatial.distance', 'scipy.optimize'):
        sys.modules[str(module)] = MockModule(str(module))

    import colour

    xyY = (0.4316, 0.3777, 0.1008)
    colour.xyY_to_XYZ(xyY)

.. code-block:: text

    array([ 0.11518475,  0.1008    ,  0.05089373])

Or directly using the ``mock_scipy_for_colour`` definition:

.. code-block:: python

    from mock_for_colour import mock_scipy_for_colour

    mock_scipy_for_colour()

    import colour

    xyY = (0.4316, 0.3777, 0.1008)
    colour.xyY_to_XYZ(xyY)

.. code-block:: text

    array([ 0.11518475,  0.1008    ,  0.05089373])

Anything relying on the spectral code will be unusable, but a great amount of
useful functionality will still be available.

Basics

This page puts an emphasis on basic concepts of **Colour**, those are important
to understand.

Object Name Categorisation
--------------------------

The API tries to bundle the objects by categories by naming them with common
prefixes which makes introspection and auto-completion easier.

For example, in `IPython <https://ipython.org/>`__ or `Jupyter Notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`__,
most of the definitions pertaining to the spectral distribution handling can
be found as follows:

.. code:: python

    In [1]: import colour

    In [2]: colour.sd_
     sd_blackbody()                            sd_gaussian()                             sd_rayleigh_scattering()                  sd_zeros
     sd_CIE_illuminant_D_series()              sd_mesopic_luminous_efficiency_function() sd_single_led()
     sd_CIE_standard_illuminant_A()            sd_multi_leds()                           sd_to_aces_relative_exposure_values()
     sd_constant()                             sd_ones()                                 sd_to_XYZ

Likewise, for the spectral distribution handling related attributes:

.. code:: python

    In [2]: colour.SD
                      SD_GAUSSIAN_METHODS   SD_TO_XYZ_METHODS     SDS_ILLUMINANTS       SDS_LIGHT_SOURCES
                      SD_MULTI_LEDS_METHODS SDS_COLOURCHECKERS    SDS_LEFS
                      SD_SINGLE_LED_METHODS SDS_FILTERS           SDS_LENSES

Similarly, all the RGB colourspaces can be individually accessed from the
``colour.models`` namespace:

.. code:: python

    In [2]: colour.models.RGB_COLOURSPACE
                             RGB_COLOURSPACE_ACES2065_1           RGB_COLOURSPACE_ACESPROXY            RGB_COLOURSPACE_APPLE_RGB            RGB_COLOURSPACE_BT470_525
                             RGB_COLOURSPACE_ACESCC               RGB_COLOURSPACE_ADOBE_RGB1998        RGB_COLOURSPACE_BEST_RGB             RGB_COLOURSPACE_BT470_625
                             RGB_COLOURSPACE_ACESCCT              RGB_COLOURSPACE_ADOBE_WIDE_GAMUT_RGB RGB_COLOURSPACE_BETA_RGB             RGB_COLOURSPACE_BT709                >
                             RGB_COLOURSPACE_ACESCG               RGB_COLOURSPACE_ALEXA_WIDE_GAMUT     RGB_COLOURSPACE_BT2020               RGB_COLOURSPACE_CIE_RGB

N-Dimensional Array Support
---------------------------

Most of **Colour** definitions are fully vectorised and support n-dimensional
array by leveraging `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`__.

While it is recommended to use
`ndarray <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/arrays.ndarray.html>`__
as input for the API objects, it is possible to use tuples or lists:

.. code:: python

    import colour

    xyY = (0.4316, 0.3777, 0.1008)
    colour.xyY_to_XYZ(xyY)

.. code-block:: text

    array([ 0.11518475,  0.1008    ,  0.05089373])

.. code:: python

    xyY = [0.4316, 0.3777, 0.1008]
    colour.xyY_to_XYZ(xyY)

.. code-block:: text

    array([ 0.11518475,  0.1008    ,  0.05089373])

.. code:: python

    xyY = [
        (0.4316, 0.3777, 0.1008),
        (0.4316, 0.3777, 0.1008),
        (0.4316, 0.3777, 0.1008),
    ]
    colour.xyY_to_XYZ(xyY)

.. code-block:: text

    array([[ 0.11518475,  0.1008    ,  0.05089373],
           [ 0.11518475,  0.1008    ,  0.05089373],
           [ 0.11518475,  0.1008    ,  0.05089373]])

As shown in the above example, there is widespread support for n-dimensional
arrays:

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np

    xyY = np.array([0.4316, 0.3777, 0.1008])
    xyY = np.tile(xyY, (6, 1))
    colour.xyY_to_XYZ(xyY)

.. code-block:: text

    array([[ 0.11518475,  0.1008    ,  0.05089373],
           [ 0.11518475,  0.1008    ,  0.05089373],
           [ 0.11518475,  0.1008    ,  0.05089373],
           [ 0.11518475,  0.1008    ,  0.05089373],
           [ 0.11518475,  0.1008    ,  0.05089373],
           [ 0.11518475,  0.1008    ,  0.05089373]])

.. code:: python

    colour.xyY_to_XYZ(xyY.reshape([2, 3, 3]))

.. code-block:: text

    array([[[ 0.11518475,  0.1008    ,  0.05089373],
            [ 0.11518475,  0.1008    ,  0.05089373],
            [ 0.11518475,  0.1008    ,  0.05089373]],

           [[ 0.11518475,  0.1008    ,  0.05089373],
            [ 0.11518475,  0.1008    ,  0.05089373],
            [ 0.11518475,  0.1008    ,  0.05089373]]])

Which enables image processing:

.. code:: python

    RGB = colour.read_image('_static/Logo_Small_001.png')
    RGB = RGB[..., 0:3]  # Discarding alpha channel.
    XYZ = colour.sRGB_to_XYZ(RGB)
    colour.plotting.plot_image(XYZ, text_kwargs={'text': 'sRGB to XYZ'})

.. image:: _static/Basics_Logo_Small_001_CIE_XYZ.png

Spectral Representation and Continuous Signal
---------------------------------------------

Floating Point Wavelengths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Colour** `current representation <https://github.com/colour-science/colour/releases/tag/v0.3.11>`__
of spectral data is atypical and has been influenced by the failures and
shortcomings of the previous implementation that required
`less than ideal code <https://github.com/colour-science/colour/commit/1e6a00ac2f39efa5ab297036366f8c9b90113caf>`__
to support floating point wavelengths. Wavelengths should not have to be
defined as integer values and it is effectively common to get data from
instruments whose domain is returned as floating point values.

For example, the data from an `Ocean Insight (Optics) STS-VIS <https://www.oceaninsight.com/products/spectrometers/microspectrometer/sts-series/sts-vis/>`__
spectrometer is typically saved with 3 digits decimal precision:

.. code-block:: text

    821.513	3112.65
    822.008	3133.74
    822.503	3107.11

A solution to the problem is to quantize the data at integer values but it
is often non-desirable. The spectra representation implementation prior to
**Colour 0.3.11** was relying on a `custom mutable mapping <https://github.com/colour-science/colour/blob/1e6a00ac2f39efa5ab297036366f8c9b90113caf/colour/utilities/data_structures.py#L38>`__
which was allowing to retrieve decimal keys within a given precision:

    data_1 = {0.1999999998: 'Nemo', 0.2000000000: 'John'}

    (0.2,)

While functional, the approach was brittle and not elegant which triggered a
`significant amount of rework <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/colour-science/colour-ramblings/blob/master/spectral_signal.ipynb>`__.

Continuous Signal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the spectral distributions in **Colour** are instances of the
:class:`colour.SpectralDistribution` class (or its sub-classes), a sub-class of
the :class:`colour.continuous.Signal` class which is itself an implementation
of the :class:`colour.continuous.AbstractContinuousFunction` `ABCMeta <https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/abc.html>`__
class:

.. inheritance-diagram:: colour.SpectralDistribution
   :parts: 1

Likewise, the multi-spectral distributions are instances
:class:`colour.MultiSpectralDistributions` class (or its sub-classes), a
sub-class of the :class:`colour.continuous.MultiSignals` class which is a
container for multiple :class:`colour.continuous.Signal` sub-class instances
and also implements the :class:`colour.continuous.AbstractContinuousFunction`
ABCMeta class.

.. inheritance-diagram:: colour.MultiSpectralDistributions
   :parts: 1

The :class:`colour.continuous.Signal` class implements the
:meth:`Signal.function` method so that evaluating the function for any
independent domain :math:`x \in\mathbb{R}` variable returns a corresponding
range :math:`y \in\mathbb{R}` variable.

It adopts an interpolating function encapsulated inside an extrapolating
function. The resulting function independent domain, stored as discrete values
in the :attr:`colour.continuous.Signal.domain` attribute corresponds with the
function dependent and already known range stored in the
:attr:`colour.continuous.Signal.range` attribute.

Consequently, it is possible to get the value of a spectral distribution at any
given wavelength:

.. code:: python

    data = {
        500: 0.0651,
        520: 0.0705,
        540: 0.0772,
        560: 0.0870,
        580: 0.1128,
        600: 0.1360
    }
    sd = colour.SpectralDistribution(data)
    sd[555.5]

.. code-block:: text

    0.083453673782958995

Getting, Setting, Indexing and Slicing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. attention::

    Indexing a spectral distribution (or multi-spectral distribution) with a
    numeric (or a numeric sequence) returns the corresponding value(s).
    Indexing a spectral distribution (or multi-spectral distribution) with a
    slice returns the values for the corresponding wavelength *indexes*.

While it is tempting to think that the :class:`colour.SpectralDistribution`
and :class:`colour.MultiSpectralDistributions` classes behave like Numpy's
`ndarray <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html>`__,
they do not entirely and some peculiarities exist that make them different.

An important difference lies in the behaviour with respect to getting and
setting the values of the data.

Getting the value(s) for a single (or multiple wavelengths) is done by indexing
the :class:`colour.SpectralDistribution` (or
:class:`colour.MultiSpectralDistributions`) class with the a single numeric
or array of numeric wavelengths, e.g. ``sd[555.5]`` or
``sd[555.25, 555.25, 555.75]``.

However, if getting the values using a :class:`slice` class instance, e.g.
``sd[0:3]``, the underlying discrete values for the indexes represented by the
:class:`slice` class instance are returned instead.

As shown in the previous section, getting the value of a wavelength is done as
follows:

.. code:: python

    data = {
        500: 0.0651,
        520: 0.0705,
        540: 0.0772,
        560: 0.0870,
        580: 0.1128,
        600: 0.1360
    }
    sd = colour.SpectralDistribution(data)
    sd[555]

.. code-block:: text

    0.083135180664062502,

Multiple wavelength values can be retrieved as follows:

.. code:: python

    sd[(555.0, 556.25, 557.5, 558.75, 560.0)]

.. code-block:: text

    array([ 0.08313518,  0.08395997,  0.08488108,  0.085897  ,  0.087     ])

However, slices will return the values for the corresponding wavelength
*indexes*:

.. code:: python

    sd[0:3]

.. code-block:: text

    array([ 0.0651,  0.0705,  0.0772])

.. code:: python

    sd[:]

.. code-block:: text

    array([ 0.0651,  0.0705,  0.0772,  0.087 ,  0.1128,  0.136 ])

.. note::

    Indexing a multi-spectral distribution is achieved similarly, it can
    however be sliced along multiple axes because the data is2-dimensional,
    e.g. `msds[0:3, 0:2]`.

A *copy* of the underlying :class:`colour.SpectralDistribution` and
:class:`colour.MultiSpectralDistributions` classes discretized data can be
accessed via the ``wavelengths`` and ``values`` properties. However, it cannot
be changed directly via the properties or slicing:

.. attention::

    The data returned by the ``wavelengths`` and ``values`` properties is a
    *copy* of the underlying :class:`colour.SpectralDistribution` and
    :class:`colour.MultiSpectralDistributions` classes discretized data: It
    can only be changed indirectly.

.. code:: python

    data = {
        500: 0.0651,
        520: 0.0705,
        540: 0.0772,
        560: 0.0870,
        580: 0.1128,
        600: 0.1360
    }
    sd = colour.SpectralDistribution(data)
    # Note: The wavelength 500nm is at index 0.
    sd.values[0] = 0
    sd[500]

.. code-block:: text

    0.065100000000000019

Instead, the values can be set indirectly:

.. code:: python

    values = sd.values
    values[0] = 0
    sd.values = values
    sd.values

.. code-block:: text

    array([ 0.    ,  0.0705,  0.0772,  0.087 ,  0.1128,  0.136 ])

Domain-Range Scales
-------------------

.. note::

    This section contains important information.

**Colour** adopts 4 main input domains and output ranges:

-   *Scalars* usually in domain-range `[0, 1]` (or `[0, 10]` for
    *Munsell Value*).
-   *Percentages* usually in domain-range `[0, 100]`.
-   *Degrees* usually in domain-range `[0, 360]`.
-   *Integers* usually in domain-range `[0, 2**n -1]` where `n` is the bit
    depth.

It is error prone but it is also a direct consequence of the inconsistency of
the colour science field itself. We have discussed at length about this and we
were leaning toward normalisation of the whole API to domain-range `[0, 1]`, we
never committed for reasons highlighted by the following points:

-   Colour Scientist performing computations related to Munsell Renotation
    System would be very surprised if the output *Munsell Value* was in range
    `[0, 1]` or `[0, 100]`.
-   A Visual Effect Industry artist would be astonished to find out that
    conversion from *CIE XYZ* to *sRGB* was yielding values in range
    `[0, 100]`.

However benefits of having a consistent and predictable domain-range scale are
numerous thus with `Colour 0.3.12 <https://github.com/colour-science/colour/releases/tag/v0.3.12>`__
we have introduced a mechanism to allow users to work within one of the two
available domain-range scales.

Scale - Reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**'Reference'** is the default domain-range scale of **Colour**, objects adopt
the implemented reference, i.e. paper, publication, etc.., domain-range scale.

The **'Reference'** domain-range scale is inconsistent, e.g. colour appearance
models, spectral conversions are typically in domain-range `[0, 100]` while RGB
models will operate in domain-range `[0, 1]`. Some objects, e.g.
:func:`colour.colorimetry.lightness_Fairchild2011` definition have mismatched
domain-range: input domain `[0, 1]` and output range `[0, 100]`.

Scale - 1
~~~~~~~~~

**'1'** is a domain-range scale converting all the relevant objects from
**Colour** public API to domain-range `[0, 1]`:

-   *Scalars* in domain-range `[0, 10]`, e.g *Munsell Value* are
    scaled by *10*.
-   *Percentages* in domain-range `[0, 100]` are scaled by *100*.
-   *Degrees* in domain-range `[0, 360]` are scaled by *360*.
-   *Integers* in domain-range `[0, 2**n -1]` where `n` is the bit
    depth are scaled by *2**n -1*.
-   *Dimensionless* values are unaffected and are indicated with `DN`.
-   *Unaffected* values are unaffected and are indicated with `UN`.

.. warning::

    The conversion to **'1'** domain-range scale is a *soft* normalisation and
    similarly to the **'Reference'** domain-range scale it is normal to
    encounter values exceeding *1*, e.g. High Dynamic Range Imagery (HDRI) or
    negative values, e.g. out-of-gamut RGB colourspace values. Some definitions
    such as :func:`colour.models.eotf_ST2084` which decodes absolute luminance
    values are not affected by any domain-range scales and are indicated with
    `UN`.

Understanding the Domain-Range Scale of an Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using :func:`colour.adaptation.chromatic_adaptation_CIE1994` definition
docstring as an example, the *Notes* section features two tables.

The first table is for the domain, and lists the input arguments affected by
the two domain-range scales and which normalisation they should adopt
depending the domain-range scale in use:

+------------+-----------------------+---------------+
| **Domain** | **Scale - Reference** | **Scale - 1** |
+============+=======================+===============+
| ``XYZ_1``  | [0, 100]              | [0, 1]        |
+------------+-----------------------+---------------+
| ``Y_o``    | [0, 100]              | [0, 1]        |
+------------+-----------------------+---------------+

The second table is for the range and lists the return value of the definition:

+------------+-----------------------+---------------+
| **Range**  | **Scale - Reference** | **Scale - 1** |
+============+=======================+===============+
| ``XYZ_2``  | [0, 100]              | [0, 1]        |
+------------+-----------------------+---------------+

Working with the Domain-Range Scales
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The current domain-range scale is returned with the
:func:`colour.get_domain_range_scale` definition:

.. code:: python

    import colour

    colour.get_domain_range_scale()

.. code-block:: text

    u'reference'

Changing from the **'Reference'** default domain-range scale to **'1'** is done
with the :func:`colour.set_domain_range_scale` definition:

.. code:: python

    XYZ_1 = [28.00, 21.26, 5.27]
    xy_o1 = [0.4476, 0.4074]
    xy_o2 = [0.3127, 0.3290]
    Y_o = 20
    E_o1 = 1000
    E_o2 = 1000
    colour.adaptation.chromatic_adaptation_CIE1994(XYZ_1, xy_o1, xy_o2, Y_o, E_o1, E_o2)

.. code-block:: text

    array([ 24.03379521,  21.15621214,  17.64301199])

.. code:: python

    colour.set_domain_range_scale('1')

    XYZ_1 = [0.2800, 0.2126, 0.0527]
    Y_o = 0.2
    colour.adaptation.chromatic_adaptation_CIE1994(XYZ_1, xy_o1, xy_o2, Y_o, E_o1, E_o2)

.. code-block:: text

    array([ 0.24033795,  0.21156212,  0.17643012])

The output tristimulus values with the **'1'** domain-range scale are equal to
those from **'Reference'** default domain-range scale divided by *100*.

Passing incorrectly scaled values to the
:func:`colour.adaptation.chromatic_adaptation_CIE1994` definition
would result in unexpected values and a warning in that case:

.. code:: python

    colour.set_domain_range_scale('Reference')

    colour.adaptation.chromatic_adaptation_CIE1994(XYZ_1, xy_o1, xy_o2, Y_o, E_o1, E_o2)

.. code-block:: text

    File "<ipython-input-...>", line 4, in <module>
      E_o2)
    File "/colour-science/colour/colour/adaptation/cie1994.py", line 134, in chromatic_adaptation_CIE1994
      warning(('"Y_o" luminance factor must be in [18, 100] domain, '
    /colour-science/colour/colour/utilities/verbose.py:207: ColourWarning: "Y_o" luminance factor must be in [18, 100] domain, unpredictable results may occur!
      warn(*args, **kwargs)
    array([ 0.17171825,  0.13731098,  0.09972054])

Setting the **'1'** domain-range scale has the following effect on the
:func:`colour.adaptation.chromatic_adaptation_CIE1994` definition:

As it expects values in domain `[0, 100]`, scaling occurs and the
relevant input values, i.e. the values listed in the domain table, ``XYZ_1``
and ``Y_o`` are converted from domain `[0, 1]` to domain `[0, 100]` by
:func:`colour.utilities.to_domain_100` definition and conversely
return value ``XYZ_2`` is converted from range `[0, 100]` to range `[0, 1]` by
:func:`colour.utilities.from_range_100` definition.

A convenient alternative to the :func:`colour.set_domain_range_scale`
definition is the :class:`colour.domain_range_scale` context manager and
decorator. It temporarily overrides **Colour** domain-range scale with given
scale value:

.. code:: python

    with colour.domain_range_scale('1'):
        colour.adaptation.chromatic_adaptation_CIE1994(XYZ_1, xy_o1, xy_o2, Y_o, E_o1, E_o2)

.. code-block:: text

    [ 0.24033795  0.21156212  0.17643012]

Multiprocessing on Windows with Domain-Range Scales
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows does not have a `fork <https://linux.die.net/man/2/fork>`__ system call,
a consequence is that child processes do not necessarily
`inherit from changes made to global variables <https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#windows>`__.

It has crucial `consequences <https://stackoverflow.com/q/55742917/931625>`__
as **Colour** stores the current domain-range scale into a global variable.

The solution is to define an initialisation definition that defines the
scale upon child processes spawning.

The :class:`colour.utilities.multiprocessing_pool` context manager conveniently
performs the required initialisation so that the domain-range scale is
propagated appropriately to child processes.

Most of the public API is available from the root ``colour`` namespace:

.. code:: python

    import colour

    print(colour.__all__[:5] + ['...'])

.. code-block:: text

    ['domain_range_scale', 'get_domain_range_scale', 'set_domain_range_scale', 'CHROMATIC_ADAPTATION_METHODS', 'CHROMATIC_ADAPTATION_TRANSFORMS', '...']

The various sub-packages also expose their public API:

.. code:: python

    from pprint import pprint

    for sub_package in ('adaptation', 'algebra', 'appearance', 'biochemistry',
                        'blindness', 'characterisation', 'colorimetry',

**Colour** computations leverage a comprehensive quantity of datasets available
in most sub-packages, for example the ``colour.colorimetry.datasets`` defines
the following components:

.. code:: python

    pprint(colour.colorimetry.datasets.__all__)

.. code-block:: text

    ['MSDS_CMFS',
     'MSDS_CMFS_LMS',
     'MSDS_CMFS_RGB',
     'MSDS_CMFS_STANDARD_OBSERVER',

From Spectral Distribution
--------------------------

Whether it be a sample spectral distribution, colour matching functions or
illuminants, spectral data is manipulated using an object built with the
``colour.SpectralDistribution`` class or based on it:

The sample spectral distribution can be easily plotted against the visible
spectrum:

.. code:: python

    # Plotting the sample spectral distribution.
    plot_single_sd(sd)

.. image:: _static/Tutorial_Sample_SD.png

With the sample spectral distribution defined, its shape is retrieved as
follows:

.. code:: python

    # Displaying the sample spectral distribution shape.
    print(sd.shape)

.. code-block:: text

    (380.0, 780.0, 5.0)

The returned shape is an instance of the ``colour.SpectralShape`` class:

.. code:: python

    repr(sd.shape)

.. code-block:: text

    'SpectralShape(380.0, 780.0, 5.0)'

The ``colour.SpectralShape`` class is used throughout **Colour** to define
spectral dimensions and is instantiated as follows:

.. code:: python

    # Using *colour.SpectralShape* with iteration.
    shape = colour.SpectralShape(start=0, end=10, interval=1)
    for wavelength in shape:
        print(wavelength)

    # *colour.SpectralShape.range* method is providing the complete range of values.
    shape = colour.SpectralShape(0, 10, 0.5)
    shape.range()

             9. ,   9.5,  10. ])

**Colour** defines three convenient objects to create constant spectral
distributions:

-  ``colour.sd_constant``
-  ``colour.sd_zeros``
-  ``colour.sd_ones``

.. code:: python

    # Defining a constant spectral distribution.
    sd_constant = colour.sd_constant(100)
    print('"Constant Spectral Distribution"')
    print(sd_constant.shape)
    print(sd_constant[400])

    # Defining a zeros filled spectral distribution.
    print('\n"Zeros Filled Spectral Distribution"')
    sd_zeros = colour.sd_zeros()
    print(sd_zeros.shape)
    print(sd_zeros[400])

    # Defining a ones filled spectral distribution.
    print('\n"Ones Filled Spectral Distribution"')
    sd_ones = colour.sd_ones()
    print(sd_ones.shape)
    print(sd_ones[400])

.. code-block:: text

    0.0

    "Ones Filled Spectral Distribution"
    (360.0, 780.0, 1.0)
    1.0

By default the shape used by ``colour.sd_constant``,
``colour.sd_zeros`` and ``colour.sd_ones`` is the one defined by the
``colour.SPECTRAL_SHAPE_DEFAULT`` attribute and based on *ASTM E308-15*
practise shape.

.. code:: python

    print(repr(colour.SPECTRAL_SHAPE_DEFAULT))

.. code-block:: text

    SpectralShape(360, 780, 1)

A custom shape can be passed to construct a constant spectral distribution
with user defined dimensions:

.. code:: python

    colour.sd_ones(colour.SpectralShape(400, 700, 5))[450]

.. code-block:: text

    1.0

The ``colour.SpectralDistribution`` class supports the following
arithmetical operations:

-   *addition*
-   *subtraction*
-   *multiplication*
-   *division*
-   *exponentiation*

.. code:: python

    sd1 = colour.sd_ones()
    print('"Ones Filled Spectral Distribution"')
    print(sd1[400])

    print('\n"x2 Constant Multiplied"')
    print((sd1 * 2)[400])

    print('\n"+ Spectral Distribution"')
    print((sd1 + colour.sd_ones())[400])

.. code-block:: text

    "Ones Filled Spectral Distribution"
    1.0

    "x2 Constant Multiplied"
    2.0

    "+ Spectral Distribution"
    2.0

Often interpolation of the spectral distribution is required, this is achieved
with the ``colour.SpectralDistribution.interpolate`` method. Depending on the
wavelengths uniformity, the default interpolation method will differ.
Following *CIE 167:2005* recommendation: The method developed by
*Sprague (1880)* should be used for interpolating functions having a uniformly
spaced independent variable and a *Cubic Spline* method for non-uniformly spaced
independent variable  :cite:`CIETC1-382005e`.

The uniformity of the sample spectral distribution is assessed as follows:

.. code:: python

    # Checking the sample spectral distribution uniformity.
    print(sd.is_uniform())

.. code-block:: text

    True

In this case, since the sample spectral distribution is uniform the
interpolation defaults to the ``colour.SpragueInterpolator`` interpolator.

.. note::

    Interpolation happens in place and may alter the original data, use the
    ``colour.SpectralDistribution.copy`` method to generate a copy of the
    spectral distribution before interpolation.

.. code:: python

    # Copying the sample spectral distribution.
    sd_copy = sd.copy()

    # Interpolating the copied sample spectral distribution.
    sd_copy.interpolate(colour.SpectralShape(400, 770, 1))
    sd_copy[401]

.. code-block:: text

    0.065809599999999996

.. code:: python

    # Comparing the interpolated spectral distribution with the original one.
    plot_multi_sds([sd, sd_copy], bounding_box=[730,780, 0.25, 0.5])

.. image:: _static/Tutorial_SD_Interpolation.png

Extrapolation although dangerous can be used to help aligning two spectral
distributions together. *CIE publication CIE 15:2004 “Colorimetry”* recommends
that unmeasured values may be set equal to the nearest measured value of the
appropriate quantity in truncation :cite:`CIETC1-482004h`:

.. code:: python

    # Extrapolating the copied sample spectral distribution.
    sd_copy.extrapolate(colour.SpectralShape(340, 830))
    sd_copy[340], sd_copy[830]

.. code-block:: text

    (0.065000000000000002, 0.44800000000000018)

The underlying interpolator can be swapped for any of the **Colour**
interpolators:

.. code:: python

    pprint([
        export for export in colour.algebra.interpolation.__all__
        if 'Interpolator' in export
    ])

.. code-block:: text

        colour.SpectralShape(400, 700, 10), interpolator=colour.LinearInterpolator)

The extrapolation behaviour can be changed for ``Linear`` method instead
of the ``Constant`` default method or even use arbitrary constant ``left``
and ``right`` values:

.. code:: python

    # Extrapolating the copied sample spectral distribution with *Linear* method.
    sd_copy.extrapolate(
        colour.SpectralShape(340, 830),
        extrapolator_kwargs={
            'method': 'Linear',
            'right': 0
        })
    sd_copy[340], sd_copy[830]

Aligning a spectral distribution is a convenient way to first interpolates the
current data within its original bounds, then, if required, extrapolate any
missing values to match the requested shape:

.. code:: python

    # Aligning the cloned sample spectral distribution.
    # The spectral distribution is first trimmed as above.
    sd_copy.interpolate(colour.SpectralShape(400, 700))
    sd_copy.align(colour.SpectralShape(340, 830, 5))
    sd_copy[340], sd_copy[830]

The ``colour.SpectralDistribution`` class also supports various arithmetic
operations like *addition*, *subtraction*, *multiplication*, *division* or
*exponentiation* with *numeric* and *array_like* variables or other
``colour.SpectralDistribution`` class instances:

.. code:: python

    sd = colour.SpectralDistribution({
        410: 0.25,
        420: 0.50,
        430: 0.75,
        440: 1.0,
        450: 0.75,
        460: 0.50,
        480: 0.25
    })

    print((sd.copy() + 1).values)
    print((sd.copy() * 2).values)
    print((sd * [0.35, 1.55, 0.75, 2.55, 0.95, 0.65, 0.15]).values)
    print((sd * colour.sd_constant(2, sd.shape) * colour.sd_constant(3, sd.shape)).values)

.. code-block:: text

    [ 0.0875  0.775   0.5625  2.55    0.7125  0.325   0.0375]
    [ 1.5  3.   4.5  6.   4.5  3.   nan  1.5]

The spectral distribution can be normalised with an arbitrary factor:

.. code:: python

    print(sd.normalise().values)
    print(sd.normalise(100).values)

.. code-block:: text

    [ 0.25  0.5   0.75  1.    0.75  0.5   0.25]
    [  25.   50.   75.  100.   75.   50.   25.]

A the heart of the ``colour.SpectralDistribution`` class is the
``colour.continuous.Signal`` class which implements the
``colour.continuous.Signal.function`` method.

Evaluating the function for any independent domain
:math:`x \in \mathbb{R}` variable returns a corresponding range
:math:`y \in \mathbb{R}` variable.

It adopts an interpolating function encapsulated inside an extrapolating
function. The resulting function independent domain, stored as discrete
values in the ``colour.continuous.Signal.domain`` attribute corresponds
with the function dependent and already known range stored in the
``colour.continuous.Signal.range`` attribute.

Describing the ``colour.continuous.Signal`` class is beyond the scope of
this tutorial but the core capability can be described.

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np

    range_ = np.linspace(10, 100, 10)
    signal = colour.continuous.Signal(range_)
    print(repr(signal))

Convert to Tristimulus Values
-----------------------------

From a given spectral distribution, *CIE XYZ* tristimulus values can be
calculated:

.. code:: python

    sd = colour.SpectralDistribution(data_sample)
    cmfs = colour.MSDS_CMFS['CIE 1931 2 Degree Standard Observer']
    illuminant = colour.SDS_ILLUMINANTS['D65']

From *CIE XYZ* Colourspace
--------------------------

*CIE XYZ* is the central colourspace for Colour Science from which many
computations are available, expanding to even more computations:

.. code:: python

    # Displaying objects interacting directly with the *CIE XYZ* colourspace.
    pprint(colour.COLOURSPACE_MODELS)

Convert to Display Colours
--------------------------

*CIE XYZ* tristimulus values can be converted into *sRGB* colourspace *RGB*
values in order to display them on screen:

.. code:: python

    # The output domain of *colour.sd_to_XYZ* is [0, 100] and the input
    # domain of *colour.XYZ_to_sRGB* is [0, 1]. It needs to be accounted for,
    # thus the input *CIE XYZ* tristimulus values are scaled.
    RGB = colour.XYZ_to_sRGB(XYZ / 100)
    print(RGB)

Generate Colour Rendition Charts
--------------------------------

Likewise, colour values from a colour rendition chart sample can be computed.

.. note::

    This is useful for render time checks in the VFX industry,
    where a synthetic colour chart can be inserted into a render to
    ensure the colour management is acting as expected.

The ``colour.characterisation`` sub-package contains the dataset for
various colour rendition charts:

.. code:: python

    # Colour rendition charts chromaticity coordinates.
    print(sorted(colour.characterisation.CCS_COLOURCHECKERS.keys()))

    # Colour rendition charts spectral distributions.
    print(sorted(colour.characterisation.SDS_COLOURCHECKERS.keys()))

    ['BabelColor Average', 'ColorChecker N Ohta', 'babel_average', 'cc_ohta']

.. note::

    The above ``cc2005``, ``babel_average`` and ``cc_ohta`` keys are
    convenient aliases for respectively ``ColorChecker 2005``, ``BabelColor Average``

    patch_name = 'neutral 5 (.70 D)'
    patch_sd = colour.SDS_COLOURCHECKERS['ColorChecker N Ohta'][patch_name]

**Colour** defines a convenient plotting object to draw synthetic colour
rendition charts figures:

.. code:: python

    plot_single_colour_checker(
        colour_checker='ColorChecker 2005', text_kwargs={'visible': False})

.. image:: _static/Tutorial_Colour_Checker.png

Convert to Chromaticity Coordinates
-----------------------------------

Given a spectral distribution, chromaticity coordinates *CIE xy* can be computed
using the ``colour.XYZ_to_xy`` definition:

.. code:: python

    # Computing *CIE xy* chromaticity coordinates for the *neutral 5 (.70 D)* patch.
    xy =  colour.XYZ_to_xy(XYZ)
    print(xy)

.. code-block:: text

    [ 0.31259787  0.32870029]

Chromaticity coordinates *CIE xy* can be plotted into the *CIE 1931 Chromaticity Diagram*:

.. code:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Plotting the *CIE 1931 Chromaticity Diagram*.
    # The argument *standalone=False* is passed so that the plot doesn't get
    # displayed and can be used as a basis for other plots.
    plot_chromaticity_diagram_CIE1931(standalone=False)

    # Plotting the *CIE xy* chromaticity coordinates.
    x, y = xy
    plt.plot(x, y, 'o-', color='white')

    # Annotating the plot.
    plt.annotate(patch_sd.name.title(),
                 xy=xy,
                 xytext=(-50, 30),
                 textcoords='offset points',
                 arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', connectionstyle='arc3, rad=-0.2'))

    # Displaying the plot.
    render(
        standalone=True,
        limits=(-0.1, 0.9, -0.1, 0.9),
        x_tighten=True,
        y_tighten=True)
