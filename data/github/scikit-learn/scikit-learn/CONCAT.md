# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version   | Supported          |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.1     | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0.1   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities by email to `security@scikit-learn.org`.
This email is an alias to a subset of the scikit-learn maintainers' team.

If the security vulnerability is accepted, a patch will be crafted privately
in order to prepare a dedicated bugfix release as timely as possible (depending
on the complexity of the fix).
# Code of Conduct

We are a community based on openness, as well as friendly and didactic discussions.

We aspire to treat everybody equally, and value their contributions.

Decisions are made based on technical merit and consensus.

Code is not the only way to help the project. Reviewing pull requests,
answering questions to help others on mailing lists or issues, organizing and
teaching tutorials, working on the website, improving the documentation, are
all priceless contributions.

We abide by the principles of openness, respect, and consideration of others of
the Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/


Contributing to scikit-learn
============================

The latest contributing guide is available in the repository at
`doc/developers/contributing.rst`, or online at:

https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html

There are many ways to contribute to scikit-learn, with the most common ones
being contribution of code or documentation to the project. Improving the
documentation is no less important than improving the library itself. If you
find a typo in the documentation, or have made improvements, do not hesitate to
send an email to the mailing list or preferably submit a GitHub pull request.
Documentation can be found under the
[doc/](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/tree/main/doc) directory.

But there are many other ways to help. In particular answering queries on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues),
investigating bugs, and [reviewing other developers' pull
requests](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html#code-review-guidelines)
are very valuable contributions that decrease the burden on the project
maintainers.

Another way to contribute is to report issues you're facing, and give a "thumbs
up" on issues that others reported and that are relevant to you. It also helps
us if you spread the word: reference the project from your blog and articles,
link to it from your website, or simply star it in GitHub to say "I use it".

<!--
Thanks for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look at
the contribution guidelines: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md
-->

#### Reference Issues/PRs
<!--
Example: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.
Please use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests
you resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request
is merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests
-->


#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.


#### Any other comments?


<!--
Please be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is
necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value
all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to
review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering,
convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either
case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.
For more information, see our FAQ on this topic:
