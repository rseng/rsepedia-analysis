Making Changes
--------------

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.

  - This is usually the master branch.
  - Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be
    on that branch.
  - To quickly create a topic branch based on master::

     git checkout -b fix/master/my_contribution master

    Please avoid working directly on the master branch.

* Make commits of logical units.

* Please provide tests and documentation with your changes.

* Check for unnecessary whitespace with ``git diff --check`` before committing.

* Follow the `NCIP Good Practices for Commit Messages`_.
  Start with a one-line summary followed by a blank line followed by a
