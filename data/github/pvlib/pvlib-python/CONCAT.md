# Summary

pvlib python is a community-supported open source tool that provides a
set of functions and classes for simulating the performance of
photovoltaic energy systems. pvlib python aims to provide reference
implementations of models relevant to solar energy, including for
example algorithms for solar position, clear sky irradiance, irradiance
transposition, DC power, and DC-to-AC power conversion. pvlib python is
an important component of a growing ecosystem of open source tools for
solar energy [@Holmgren2018].

pvlib python is developed on GitHub by contributors from academia,
national laboratories, and private industry. pvlib python is released
with a BSD 3-clause license allowing permissive use with attribution.
pvlib python is extensively tested for functional and algorithm
consistency. Continuous integration services check each pull request on
multiple platforms and Python versions. The pvlib python API is
thoroughly documented and detailed tutorials are provided for many
features. The documentation includes help for installation and
guidelines for contributions. The documentation is hosted at
readthedocs.org as of this writing. A Google group and StackOverflow tag
provide venues for user discussion and help.

The pvlib python API was designed to serve the various needs of the many
subfields of solar power research and engineering. It is implemented in
three layers: core functions, the ``Location`` and ``PVSystem`` classes,
and the ``ModelChain`` class. The core API consists of a collection of
functions that implement algorithms. These algorithms are typically
implementations of models described in peer-reviewed publications. The
functions provide maximum user flexibility, however many of the function
arguments require an unwieldy number of parameters. The next API level
contains the ``Location`` and ``PVSystem`` classes. These abstractions
provide simple methods that wrap the core function API layer. The method
API simplification is achieved by separating the data that represents
the object (object attributes) from the data that the object methods
operate on (method arguments). For example, a ``Location`` is
represented by a latitude, longitude, elevation, timezone, and name,
which are ``Location`` object attributes. Then a ``Location`` object
method operates on a ``datetime`` to get the corresponding solar
position. The methods combine these data sources when calling the
function layer, then return the results to the user. The final level of
API is the ``ModelChain`` class, designed to simplify and standardize
the process of stitching together the many modeling steps necessary to
convert a time series of weather data to AC solar power generation,
given a PV system and a location.

pvlib python was ported from the PVLib MATLAB toolbox in 2014
[@Stein2012, @Andrews2014]. Efforts to make the project more pythonic
were undertaken in 2015 [@Holmgren2015]. Additional features continue to
be added, see, for example [@Stein2016, @Holmgren2016] and the
documentation's "What's New" section.

pvlib python has been used in numerous studies, for example, of solar
power forecasting [@Gagne2017, @Holmgren2017], development of solar
irradiance models [@Polo2016], and estimation of photovoltaic energy
potential [@Louwen2017]. Mikofski et. al. used pvlib python to study
the accuracy of clear sky models with different aerosol optical depth
and precipitable water data sources [@Mikofski2017] and to determine the
effects of spectral mismatch on different PV devices [@Mikofski2016].
pvlib python is a foundational piece of an award, "An Open Source
Evaluation Framework for Solar Forecasting," made under the Department
of Energy Solar Forecasting 2 program [@DOESF2].

Plans for pvlib python development includes the implementation of new
and existing models, addition of functionality to assist with
input/output, and improvements to API consistency.

The source code for each pvlib python version is archived with Zenodo
[@pvlibZenodo].

NREL provides a C implementation of the solar position algorithm described in
[Reda, I.; Andreas, A. (2003). Solar Position Algorithm for Solar Radiation Applications. 55 pp.; NREL Report No. TP-560-34302](http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/34302.pdf).

This folder contains the files required to make SPA C code accessible
to the `pvlib-python` package. We use the Cython package to wrap the NREL SPA 
implementation. 

** Due to licensing issues, the SPA C files can _not_ be distributed with
`pvlib-python`. You must download the SPA C files from the
[NREL website](https://midcdmz.nrel.gov/spa/). **

Download the `spa.c` and `spa.h` files from NREL,  and copy them into the
`pvlib/spa_c_files` directory. When the extension is built, the ``timezone``
field in the SPA C files is replaced with `time_zone` to avoid a nameclash
with the function `__timezone` that is redefined by Python>=3.5. This issue
is [Python bug 24643](https://bugs.python.org/issue24643).

There are a total of 5 files needed to compile the C code, described below:

* `spa.c`: original C code from NREL 
* `spa.h`: header file for spa.c
* `cspa_py.pxd`: a cython header file which essentially tells cython which
  parts of the main header file to pay attention to
* `spa_py.pyx`: the cython code used to define both functions in the python
  namespace. NOTE: It is possible to provide user access to other paramters of
  the SPA algorithm through modifying this file 
* `setup.py`: a distutils file which performs the compiling of the cython code

The cython compilation process produces two files:
* `spa_py.c`: an intermediate cython c file
* `spa_py.so` or `spa_py.<cpyver-plat>.pyd`: the python module which
  can be imported into a namespace

To create the SPA Python extension, use the following shell command inside this
folder:

    $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

There are four optional keyword arguments `delta_ut1=0`, `slope=30.0`,
`azm_rotation=-10`, `atmos_refract` that effect four optional return values
`incidence`, `suntransit`, `sunrise`, and `sunset`. If not given, the defaults
shown are used.

There is an example in `spa_py_example.py` that contains a test function called
`spa_calc_example` that users can use to check that the result is consistent
with expected values:

    >>> from spa_py_example import spa_calc_example
    >>> r = spa_calc_example()
    {

    }
Benchmarks
==========

pvlib includes a small number of performance benchmarking tests. These
tests are run using
[airspeed velocity](https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (ASV).

The basic structure of the tests and how to run them is described below.
We refer readers to the ASV documentation for more details. The AstroPy
[documentation](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-benchmarks/tree/master)
may also be helpful.

The test configuration is described in [asv.conf.json](asv.conf.json).
The performance tests are located in the [benchmarks](benchmarks) directory.

Comparing timings
-----------------

Note that, unlike pytest, the asv tests require changes to be committed
to git before they can be tested. The ``run`` command takes a positional
argument to describe the range of git commits or branches to be tested.
For example, if your feature branch is named ``feature``, a useful asv
run may be (from the same directory as `asv.conf.json`):

```
$ asv run master..feature
```

This will generate timings for every commit between the two specified
revisions. If you only care about certain commits, you can run them by
their git hashes directly like this:

```
$ asv run e42f8d24^!
```

Note: depending on what shell they use, Windows users may need to use
double-carets:

```
$ asv run e42f8d24^^!
```

You can then compare the timing results of two commits:

```
$ asv compare 0ff98b62 e42f8d24

All benchmarks:

       before           after         ratio

```

The `ratio` column shows the ratio of `after / before` timings. For this
example, the `aoi` function was slowed down on purpose to demonstrate
the comparison.

Generating an HTML report
-------------------------

asv can generate a collection of interactive plots of benchmark timings across
a commit history. First, generate timings for a series of commits, like:

```
$ asv run v0.6.0..v0.8.0
```

Next, generate the HTML report:

```
$ asv publish
```

Finally, start a http server to view the test results:

```
$ asv preview

```


Nightly benchmarking
--------------------

The benchmarks are run nightly for new commits to pvlib-python/master.
