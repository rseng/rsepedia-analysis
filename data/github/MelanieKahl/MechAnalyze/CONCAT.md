# MechAnalyze
an algorithm for standardization and automation of unconfined compression test analysis

Abstract:

The mechanical properties of hydrogels, as well as native and engineered tissues are key parameters frequently assessed in biomaterial science and tissue engineering research. However, a lack of standardized methods and user-independent data analysis has impacted the research community for many decades and contributes to poor reproducibility and comparability of datasets, representing a significant issue often neglected in publications. Here, we provide a software package, MechAnalyze, facilitating the standardized and automated analysis of force-displacement data generated in unconfined compression tests. Using comparative studies of datasets analyzed manually and with MechAnalyze, we demonstrate that the software reliably determines the compressive moduli, failure stress and failure strain of hydrogels, as well as engineered and native tissues, while providing an intuitive user interface that requires minimal user input. MechAnalyze provides a fast and user-independent data analysis method and advances process standardization, reproducibility, and comparability of data for the mechanical characterization of biomaterials as well as native and engineered tissues.
