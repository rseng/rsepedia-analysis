## Version 4.2.0 (2020-11-08)

### New features

* New, self-contained installers for Windows and macOS.
* Add support for inline and interactive Matplotlib plots in the debugger.
* Automatic detection of conda and pyenv environments in
  `Preferences > Python interpreter`.
* Add functionality to do auto-formatting in the Editor. It can be triggered in
  the menu `Source > Format file or selection` or with the shorcut
  `Ctrl+Alt+I` (`Cmd+Alt+I` in macOS).
* Add support for text snippets in the Editor. The list of available snippets
  is shown in `Preferences > Completion and linting > Snippets`.
* Support caching cells sent in succession to the IPython console. This will
  run one cell after the previous one finished.
* Make variables take precedence over Pdb commands in the debugger. In case a
  variable clashes with a command, you'll have to prefix the command with `!`.
* Show a message to take a tour of Spyder features the first time 4.2.0 is
  launched.
* Drop support for Python 2.7 and 3.5.

### Important fixes

* Improve performance in the Editor when painting indent guides and showing
  linting messages.
* Prevent the creation of temporary files in Dropbox directories after saving
  in the Editor.
* Prevent the Outline to degrade performance in the Editor when visible. This
  was achieved by moving this pane to use the LSP architecture.
* Support Jedi 0.17.2

## Version 4.1.2 (2020-04-03)

### New features

* Add a new entry to the status bar to show the current state of the Python
  language server. This will allow users to know if completions, linting and
  folding are working as expected or have issues. Clicking on this entry will
  also show a menu from which is possible to restart the server manually.

### Important fixes

* Completely disable warning informing to restart Spyder when a screen
  resolution is detected on macOS.
* Show an error message when it's not possible to create a special console
  for Sympy, Cython or Pylab.
* Restore code folding for all files with less than 2000 lines.
* Fix showing help for dot objects (e.g. `np.sin`) in the IPython console.
* Fix showing kernel initialization error messages on Windows.

## Version 4.0.0 (2019-12-06)

### New features

#### Main Window

* Add a dark theme for the entire interface.
* Add a new `Plots` pane to browse all inline figures generated by the IPython console.
* Several plugins were renamed to have a simpler interface:
  - `Static code analysis` to `Code Analysis`
  - `File explorer` to `Files`
  - `Find in files` to `Find`
  - `History log` to `History`
  - `Project explorer` to `Project`
* Add a new action called `Undock` to the Options menu of every plugin. This action
  creates a separate window that only contains the plugin and can be moved to a
  different place of the screen or to a different monitor.
* Add a clock to the status bar, for those who like to work in full screen mode. It can
  be activated in
  `Preferences > General > Advanced settings > Status bar > Show clock`.
* Show current conda environment and git branch (if any) in the status bar.
* Add translation for Simplified Chinese.

#### Editor

* Add code folding functionality.
* Show code completions as you type.
* Add autosave functionality to be able to recover unsaved files after a crash.
* Add indentation guides. They can be activated under the `Source` menu.
* Add a panel to show the current class and method/function where the cursor is placed,
  inspired by similar functionality present in Microsoft Visual Studio. It can activated
  under the menu `Source > Show selector for classes and functions`.
* Allow setting multiple line length indicators under
  `Preferences > Editor > Display > Show vertical lines`.
* Add `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+,` and `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+.` shortcuts to go to the previous/next
  warning and error, respectively.
* Allow scrolling past the end of the file. This can activated in
  `Preferences > Editor > Display > Scroll past the end`.
* Add the ability to take into account code indentation and PEP 8 when adding and
  removing comments.
* Add an option to convert end-of-line characters on save.  This can activated in
  `Preferences > Editor > Advanced settings > End-of-line characters`
* Add `Ctrl+{` and `Ctrl+_` shortcuts to split panels vertically and horizontally,
  respectively.
* Add `Alt+Shift+W` shortcut to close the current split panel.
* After pressing a quote or brace the current selection gets enclosed on it.
* Add automatic docstring generation (parameters, return vals and exceptions raised) in
  Numpydoc and Googledoc formats.
* Add an option to its context menu to sort files alphabetically.
* Add the ability to reference issues on Gitlab (`gl`), Github (`gh`) and Bitbucket
  (`bb`) in comments or strings by using the convention `{gl/gh/bb}:my-org/my-repo#123`.
  You can also reference them by `{gl/gh/bb}-123`, if you've previously set up an
  `upstream` or `origin` remote in your repo.
* Use the Language Server Protocol for code completion and linting.

#### IPython console
* Files are now run in an empty namespace. This avoids picking up variables defined in
  the console while running a file. To get the previous behavior you need to go to the
  menu `Run > Configuration per file` and activate the option called
  `Run in console’s namespace instead of an empty one`.
* Add menu options to start consoles in Pylab, Sympy and Cython modes.
* Run cells through a function called `runcell` instead of pasting their contents
  directly to the console.
* Use Jupyter comms to handle communications between frontend and kernel.

#### Debugger

* Add code completion to it.
* Add the ability to execute multi-line statements on it.
* Add syntax highlighting to it and color `ipdb` prompts.
* Add permanent history to it, separate from the console history.
* `runfile` and `runcell` can now be called when the debugger is active.
* Add the ability to debug cells by pressing `Alt+Shift+Return` or by going to the menu
  `Debug > Debug cell`.
* Add an option to ignore installed Python libraries while debugging. It can be turned on
  in the menu `Debug > Ignore Python libraries while debugging`.
* Add the ability to see inline plots while debugging. For that you need to activate the
  option called `Process execute events while debugging`, present in in the `Debug` menu.
* Disambiguate file names in the Breakpoints pane.

#### Variable Explorer

* Add a new viewer to inspect any Python object in a tree-like way.
* Add the ability to search for variable names and types.
* Restore the ability to refresh it while code is being executed.
* Add support for Numpy object arrays.
* Add MultiIndex display support to the DataFrame viewer.
* Add support for all Pandas indexes.
* Add support for sets.
* Add a new option to exclude callables and modules.
* Add an option to its context menu (the one you get with a mouse right-click) to resize
  columns to its contents.

#### Files

* Add the possibility to associate different external applications to open specific file
  extensions (e.g. `.txt` files with Notepad++ or VSCode).
* Add a context menu action called `Open externally` to all files to open them with the
  operating system default program associated with the file type.
* Add multi-select functionality, i.e. using `Ctrl/Shift+click` to select multiple files.
* Add the ability to copy/paste files and their absolute or relative paths.
* Use special icons for different file types.
* Add an option to open files and directories with a single click.

#### Outline

* Show cells grouped in sections. Level 1 cells are defined by `#%%` (as before), level 2
  cells by `#%%%`, level 3 cells by `#%%%%` and so on. With this new syntax, all `n+1`
  cells will be conveniently grouped under n-level cells in the outline tree.
* Add an option to sort files alphabetically. By default files are shown in the same
  order as in the Editor.
* Add a default name for cells to encourage users to name them. This way cells can be
  more easily spotted in the outline tree.

#### Preferences:

* Spyder can now read default configuration options saved in `spyder.ini` files from
  system (e.g. `/etc/spyder`) and conda environment (e.g.
  `~/miniconda/envs/py36/etc/spyder`) directories. This can be used by sysadmins to turn
  on/off certain options by default for all users in an organization. To inspect the
  paths from which Spyder reads these files per operating system and the order in which
  it does that, you can use the new command line option `spyder --paths`.

#### API Changes

##### Major changes
* Create one module per plugin in `spyder.plugins` and move there all widgets and utility
  modules used by that plugin. For example, `spyder.widgets.sourcecode.codeeditor` is now
  at `spyder.plugins.editor.widgets.codeeditor`.
* Create the `spyder.api` module to expose a public API for external plugins. *Note*:
  This is still not stable. It'll be improved and stabilized for Spyder 5 (to be released
  in 2020).
* Add a `SpyderPlugin` class to be able to create plugins without an associated graphical
  pane.

##### Minor changes
* Remove the `SpyderPluginMixin` class. Its contents were added to `BasePluginMixin` and
  `BasePluginWidgetMixin` (in `plugins/base.py`).
* Move `SpyderDockWidget` to `widgets/dock.py`.
* Config pages of all plugins are now located in a separate module called
  `spyder/plugins/<plugin>/confpage.py`

#### Under the hood
* Drop support for Python 3.4.
* Increase minimal PyQt supported version to 5.6.
* Deprecate the usage of `debug_print` and use the `logging` module instead.

## Version 3.3.2 (2018-11-24)

#### Main Window

### New features


* Add new German and Hungarian translations.

#### Preferences

* Give users the ability to select the OpenGL implementation
  used by Qt. This option can be changed in
  `General > Advanced Settings > Rendering engine`.

#### Find in files

* Simplify the way to exclude files from search.
* Fix error that prevented to stop a search when it was in

  one really does.
* Fix several critical memory leaks.

#### Under the hood

* Remove support for PyQt 5.4 and older versions.

## Version 3.2 (2017-07-24)

### New features

#### Python Console
* Remove it for all operating systems. For an explanation, please see
  [here](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/4524).

#### Main Window
* Add a dialog to quickly view all keyboard shortcuts defined in Spyder.
  It can be accessed in the `Help > Shortcuts Summary` menu or using
  the `Meta+F1` shortcut.
* Add an option to set a custom screen resolution scale factor. This option
  is available in `Preferences > Appearance > Screen resolution`.
* Show Spyder internal errors in a special dialog to ease submitting them
  to Github.

#### Editor
* Add the ability to reorganize tabs by drag and drop.
* Add option to only replace in a selection.
* Add `Ctrl+Up` and `Ctrl+Down` shortcuts to move to the next/previous
  cell, respectively.
* Add `Alt+Enter` shortcut to re-run the last cell.
* Add support to run Cython files from the Editor (i.e. by simply
  pressing `F5`).
* Add syntax highlighting support for Markdown files.
* Add a tab switcher dialog to navigate files in most recently used
  order. This dialog is activated with `Ctrl+Tab` and
  `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` to go in forward or backward order, respectively.
* Make `Shift+Enter` search text backwards in the find/replace
  widget.
* Add `Shift+Del` shortcut to delete lines.
* Add `Ctrl+]` and `Ctrl+[` shortcuts to indent/unindent text,
  respectively.
* Add a *Save copy as* action.
* Add a context menu entry to show the selected file in the operating
  system file explorer.
* Apply smart indentation rules to Python files only. For non-Python
  files, the Editor will preserve the indentation level of the
  previous line.

#### IPython Console
* Several improvements to its debugger:
  - Restore the ability to inspect variables using the Variable
    Explorer.
  - Make plotting work with a new `%plot` magic, but only using
    the `inline` backend (e.g. `%plot plt.plot(range(10))`).
  - Add history browsing with the Up and Down arrow keys.
  - Make the *Clear console* and *Reset* keyboard shortcuts to work.
  - Show plots from the Variable Explorer.
  - Change the current working directory using the Working Directory toolbar.
  - Use `Ctrl+Shift+C` to copy text.
* Add the possibility to run a file in the same (dedicated) console all the
  time.
* Allow to rename consoles by doing a double-click on their tabs and setting
  a new name.
* Make drag and drop of its tabs to work.
* Make the `%cd` magic to change the current working directory of the File
  Explorer and Working Directory toolbar.
* Add menu entries to show environment variables and `sys.path` contents for
  each console.
* Make it use the same color scheme of the Editor.
* Automatically load the Cython extension if Cython is installed.

#### Find in Files
* Add options to search on the current file, project or working directory.
* Display results as search takes place.
* Allow to order results alphabetically.
* Add a spinner as indicator of a search in progress.
* Simplify visualization of results.
* Remove previous search results when a new search takes place.
* Improve file and string encoding to bypass and correct errors
  associated with codification.
* Inform users if search regexp patterns are incorrect.
* Remove unused search options.
* Omit binary files during a search.

#### File Explorer
* Add an option to show the selected file in the operating system
  file explorer.
* Show icons for different file types (pdf, image, video, audio,
  compressed and MS Office files).
* Make it change the current working directory of the active console
  when changing directories on it.

#### Working Directory toolbar
* Rename it to *Current working directory* (it was Global working
  directory).
* Simplify its options to make them more understandable.
* Make it show the working directory of the active IPython console and
  the current directory in the File Explorer.

#### Preferences
* Prevent assignment of `Shift+<single key>` shortcuts because they can't
  be used by Qt applications unless they are hard-coded in the application
  itself.

#### Under the hood
* Use `pycodestyle` package instead of `pep8` to do style analysis.
* Add `pyopengl` as a new dependency to our pip wheels on Linux to
  prevent crashes related to OpenGL in PyQt 5.7+.
* Demand `rope` 0.10.5+ in our wheels because it supports Python 2
  and 3 with the same codebase.

### New features

#### Main Window

  (only available with PyQt5).
* Improve the use of tabs instead of spaces for indentation.

* Show completions for Numpy and Matplotlib compiled objects (e.g.
  `np.array` and `plt.figure`)
* Disambiguate tabs in case users open several files with the same
  name.
* Add the shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+P` to open a switcher to select among
  the symbols (functions, methods or classes) present in a file.
  Also add an entry in the `File` menu and toolbar button to show
  this switcher.

#### Variable Explorer
* Add support for the most important numeric types of Numpy (32 and 64
  bits int, float and complex numbers).
* Save format for floats in DataFrame editor.
* Make the index column of DataFrame editor always visible when scrolling
  to right and left.
* Add support for Pandas DatetimeIndex objects.
* Show empty Numpy arrays.

#### IPython Console
* Be able to load kernel json files anywhere in the file system when
  connecting to external kernels.
* Add an option (under `Preferences > Run` and `Run > Configure`) to
  clear all variables present in a console before running a file (it
  runs `%reset -f` in the associated kernel).

#### Profiler
* Show time units (in seconds) spent by each function or method.

#### Settings
* Make all keyboard shortcuts configurable

#### Under the hood
* Add the `--project <path-to-dir>` command line option to load
  projects at startup.

## Version 3.0 (2016-09-24)

### New features

#### Main Window

* The *Object Inspector* pane was renamed to *Help*.
* Add a new icon theme based on FontAwesome.
* Add an *Introduction* interactive tutorial (under the `Help` menu).
* Add new default layouts (Horizontal, Vertical, Matlab and Rstudio), and also the
  possibility to name custom layouts.
* Panes that are tabbed next to each other can now be rearranged by dragging and
  dropping their tabs.
* Check for Spyder updates at startup, and also if you go to the menu entry
  `Help > Check for updates`.
* Add the shortcut `Shift+Alt+R` to restart the application.
* Add an option to warn when exiting the application, under
  `Preferences > General > Interface > Prompt when exiting`.
* Add Portuguese, Russian and Japanese translations.
* Remove light mode

#### Editor

* Add highlighting and code completion to all file types supported by Pygments
  (a syntax highlighting library)
* Use `Ctrl+M` and `Ctrl+Alt+M` to visually create matrices and vectors. It also
  works on the Python and IPython consoles.
* Add a new file switcher inspired by the Sublime Text one, which can be called
  with the `Ctrl+P` shortcut. It can also be used to look for classes, functions
  and methods inside a file, using the `@my_function` syntax.

#### Projects

* A new menu entry called *Projects* was added to the main window with all
  actions related to projects.
* A project now saves the state of open files in the Editor, so that people can
  easily work on different coding efforts at the same time.
* The project's path is added to `PYTHONPATH`, so that Python packages
  developed as part of a project can be easily imported in Spyder consoles.
* The project explorer now shows a file tree view of the current project, as
  other editors and IDEs do (e.g. Sublime Text and VSCode).
* Projects are completely optional and not imposed on users, i.e. users can work
  without creating any project.

#### Settings

* Keyboard shortcuts can now be entered in an easier and more intuitive way.
* Add a menu entry to reset to default settings, under
  `Tools > Reset Spyder to factory defaults`.
* The language used in the main interface can now be changed. The option to
  do it is present in `General > Advanced Settings`.
* `Syntax coloring` now has a preview of the selected theme and it's able to
  change the current theme for all plugins.
* Plain and Rich text fonts for all plugins are now changed in
  `General > Appearance`.
* Add a new entry called `Python interpreter` to allow people to select the
  interpreter used for all Python and IPython consoles (this was before in
  `Console > Advanced settings`).
* Rename the `Console` entry to `Python console`.

#### IPython console

* Drop support for IPython 3.0 and older versions.
* Support the new `qtconsole` package instead.
* Communicate directly with IPython kernels instead of doing it through the
  Python  console.

#### Debugging

* Enter debugging mode if running a file generates errors. This is not activated
  by default but you can do it by going to `Run > Configure > General settings`.

#### Profiler

* Add the ability to save and restore profiler data to compare speed improvements.

#### Working directory toolbar

* Get directory completions by pressing the `Tab` key twice on it.

#### API Changes

##### Major changes

* The `spyderlib` module was renamed to `spyder`
* `spyderplugins` has been removed and its plugins have been assigned to different
  different modules (`spyder_profiler`, `spyder_breakpoints`, etc) still
  distributed with the Spyder package.

##### Minor changes

* `spyderlib.widgets.dicteditor.DictEditor` has been renamed to
  `spyder.widgets.variableexplorer.collectionseditor.CollectionsEditor`.
* `spyderlib/widgets/dicteditorutils.py` has been renamed to
  `spyder/widgets/variableexplorer/utils.py`.
* `spyderlib/widgets/externalshell/namespacebrowser.py` has been moved to
  `spyder/widgets/variableexplorer`.
* `spyderlib/widgets/externalshell/syntaxhighlighters.py` has been moved to
  `spyder/utils/`.
* Variable Explorer editor widgets were moved from `spyderlib.widgets`
  to `spyder.widgets.variableexplorer`:
    * `spyder.widgets.variableexplorer.arrayeditor`
    * `spyder.widgets.variableexplorer.collectionseditor`
    * `spyder.widgets.variableexplorer.objecteditor`
    * `spyder.widgets.variableexplorer.texteditor`
    * `spyder.widgets.variableexplorer.dataframeeditor`
* Modules used for configuration options (e.g. `spyderlib.config`,
  `spyderlib.baseconfig`, etc) were moved to a new namespace called
  `spyder.config`.
* Modules and files related to the application have been moved to
  `spyder.app`.
* `spyderlib/plugins/projectexplorer.py` has been renamed to
  `spyder/plugins/projects.py`
* `spyderlib/widgets/projectexplorer.py` has been renamed to
  `spyder/widgets/projects/explorer.py`
* `spyderlib/plugins/inspector.py` was renamed to
  `spyder/plugins/help.py`.
* `spyderlib/utils/inspector` was renamed to `spyder/utils/help`.
* `spyderlib.qt` was removed.
* `spyderlib/widgets/ipython.py` was broken in several files inside
   `spyder/widgets/ipythonconsole`.
* `spyder/widgets/externalshell/{sitecustomize.py, osx_app_site.py}` were
  moved to `spyder/utils/site`
* `spyder/widgets/externalshell/start_ipython_kernel.py` was moved to
  `spyder/utils/ipython`

#### Under the hood

* Drop support for Python 2.6 and 3.2.
* Support PyQt5.
* Drop official support for PySide. Support for it will have to come from the community.
* Move our settings directory to `HOME/.spyder{-py3}`. Previous location was `HOME/.spyder2{-py3}`
* On Linux we now follow the XDG specification to save our settings, i.e. they are saved in
  `~/.config/spyder{-py3}` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/spyder{-py3}` if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is
  defined.
* Use the new (pythonic) style for signals and slots.
* Test Spyder with the help of Travis and AppVeyor.
* Code completions and help retrieval on the Editor are done asynchronously using a
  client/server architecture based on PyZMQ.
* Spyder now uses the `qtpy` package to be able to work with PyQt4 and PyQt5 seamlessly.

* Several important compatibility fixes for PySide.
* Improve our support for IPython 1.0+.

----

## Version 2.2.4

### Bug fixes

* [Issue 347](../../issues/347) - Matplotlib hangs on Mac if using PySide
* [Issue 1265](../../issues/1265) - Create a Debug menu to easily show how to set breakpoints
* [Issue 1489](../../issues/1489) - Project Explorer does not load all projects in workspace.
* [Issue 1516](../../issues/1516) - Make Spyder compatible with both IPython 0.13 and 1.0

### Other Changes

* Make Spyder compatible with SymPy 0.7.3+
* Add shortcuts to the tooltips of all toolbars
* Make IPython Console work better if Matplotlib is not installed

----

## Version 2.2.3

### Bug fixes

* [Issue 634](../../issues/634) - Debugging: Lingering break points
* [Issue 639](../../issues/639) - Project Explorer: horizontal size issue (added an optional horizontal scrollbar. This option may be enabled/disabled in the widget context menu)
* [Issue 749](../../issues/749) - Outline Explorer: Duplicate entries
* [Issue 852](../../issues/852) - Implement matlab-like cell features
* [Issue 1388](../../issues/1388) - Add an "About Spyder dependencies" dialog box
* [Issue 1438](../../issues/1438) - "runfile" doesn't work correctly if unicode_literals has been imported (replaced backslashes by slashes in paths)
* [Issue 1515](../../issues/1515) - Add an option to use the same interpreter Spyder is running on as "Python executable" for external consoles
* [Issue 1522](../../issues/1522) - licenses of the images (especially the .png)
* [Issue 1526](../../issues/1526) - Build script (setup.py) includes the wrong version of pyflakes/rope in Windows installer
* [Issue 1527](../../issues/1527) - please include the LICENSE file in the source package

### Other Changes

* New "Run selection" (F9), "Run cell" (Ctrl+Enter) and "Run cell and advance" (Shift+Enter) actions in "Run" menu entry, as a replacement to the old "Run selection or block" and "Run block and advance" actions.
* Added "Optional Dependencies" dialog box in "?" menu.
* Editor: added Monokai and Zenburn syntax coloring schemes.
* Keyboard shortcuts: removing deprecated shortcuts at startup. Otherwise, when renaming the name of a registered shortcut (in the code), the old shortcut will stay in Spyder configuration file and opening the Preferences dialog will show a shortcut conflict dialog box. In other words, shortcuts were added to configuration file when registered but never removed if they were removed from the registered shortcuts in the code (or if their context or name was renamed).
* External console tabs: fixed history browsing with Ctrl+Tab and added Shift+Ctrl+Tab support.
* Preferences>Console>Advanced: new option to switch between the default Python executable (i.e. the one used to run Spyder itself) and the custom Python executable that the user may choose freely. This change avoid side-effects when switching from a Python distribution to another on the same OS (with the same Spyder configuration file): many users do not change the Python executable and because of the way it was written in externalconsole.py, changing from a distribution of Python to another with the same Spyder config file could lead to an unexpected configuration (Spyder is executed with the new interpreter but scripts inside Spyder are executed with the old interpreter).
* Run Icons: removed deprecated images, updated other images to the new design
* setup.py/Windows installers: now building CHM documentation for Windows
* SPYDER_DEBUG environment variable now supports 3 levels of debug mode:
    * SPYDER_DEBUG=0 or False: debug mode is off
    * SPYDER_DEBUG=1 or True: debug level 1 is on (internal console is disconnected)
    * SPYDER_DEBUG=2: debug level 2 is on (+ logging coms with external Python processes)
    * SPYDER_DEBUG=3: debug level 3 is on (+ enabling -v option in external Python processes and debugging editor)

----

* Spyder startup: fixed PyQt minimum version requirement test (the old poor comparison algorithm was considering that v4.10 was older than v4.4...) (See [Issue 1291](../../issues/1291))
* Console: Matplotlib was always imported even when the Matplotlib's Patch option was not available (i.e. the Matplotlib installed version was not compatible with the patch). As a consequence, even when disabling every console advanced option in preferences, the preloaded module list was huge
* Editor:
    * When closing Spyder with unsaved modified files, Spyder was asking confirmation as many times as there were editor windows. Only one confirmation is necessary because, with current editor design, all editor windows are synced.
    * When creating two new files, saving one of them will lead to temporarily mask the leading '`*`' indicating the fact that the other untitled file was not already saved. This is simply a display issue: internally, it is clear that the file is in a non-saved state and Spyder will ask for it to be saved when trying to close the file
    * Multiple windows: when saving a new untitled file, other editor windows were getting confused on file list order -- eventually leading to data loss
    * Open file dialog: default file type filter now matches the current file (See [Issue 1201](../../issues/1201))
* Fixed "PyQt Reference Guide" link

### Other changes

* Editor: Ctrl+MouseWheel is now zooming in/out the editor text size (see [Issue 1270](../../issues/1270))
* About dialog box: changed the "This project is part of Python(x,y)" part to more general words (which are also closer to the initial meaning of this sentence) including a citation of WinPython


----


## Version 2.1.13

### Bug fixes

* Fixed [Issue 1158](../../issues/1158): "pip install spyder" fails on non-Windows platforms due to a bug in pip installation process (missing spyderlib_win_postinstall.py script)
* File Explorer/Windows/Fixed "remove tree" feature: added an error handler in shutil.rmtree to be able to remove a non-empty folder with shutil.rmtree is not working on Windows when it contains read-only files
* (See [Issue 1106](../../issues/1106)) Fixed "error: unpack requires a string argument of length 8" related to socket communication between Spyder and the remote Python process
* Editor:
    * After splitting horizontally or vertically the editor window, filenames were not synchronized when saving a file as another name (see [Issue 1120](../../issues/1120))
    * Fixed error when trying to "Save as..." a file with extension to a file without any extension (see [Issue 1183](../../issues/1183))
    * pep8 code analysis: a new line character was abusively added by Spyder to source code before analyzing it because it's necessary for pyflakes but it's not for pep8! (see [Issue 1123](../../issues/1123))
    * Fixed UnboundLocalError when clicking on "Search/Replace" button if both search pattern and replace pattern fields are empty (see [Issue 1188](../../issues/1188))
* Pylint plugin/tree widget: "go to line" was not working when filename contained additionnal dots (see [Issue 1179](../../issues/1179))
* Fixed critical bug when an invalid/unsupported version of pyflakes is installed (see [Issue 1181](../../issues/1181))
* Editor/block comments: fixed remaining PyQt API v2 compatibility issues (see [Issue 905](../../issues/905))
* Variable explorer: more flexible name fixing algorithm (even if it's not a good practice to use reference names with upper case letters, we do not remove them anymore) -- See [Issue 1169](../../issues/1169)

### Other changes

* Spyder about dialog box: added Python build architecture (32 or 64 bits)
* Find in files: fixed default 'exclude pattern' which was accidently excluding all files starting with 'build' instead of simply excluding 'build' folders as intended
* For the sake of consistency, now using single-clicks for activating entries of all tree widgets in Spyder ("Find in files" and "Pylint" are now consistent with the "Outline" explorer) -- See [Issue 1180](../../issues/1180)


----


## Version 2.1.12

### Bug fixes

* Spyder settings: sometimes (virus protection?) the .ini file can't be written, and removing the .ini file before writing seems to help, as suggested [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/spyderlib/a_P9JBJEZeE/gOK_Pr2WbE8J) (see [Issue 1086](../../issues/1086))
* Fixed Home/End key behaviour inconsistency on MacOS X (See [Issue 495](../../issues/495))
* Internal console: new option "Pop up internal console when errors were intercepted" -- default: False, which avoids loosing focus when a traceback is shown in the internal console... but features may also fail silently! (bugs could stay hidden a while before being taken care of) -- See [Issue 1016](../../issues/1016)
* Fixed "TypeError: file_saved(long,long).emit(): argument 1 has unexpected type 'long'" error occuring on some Linux 32-bit platforms -- See [Issue 1094](../../issues/1094)
* Console: find/replace widget "Search next/previous occurrence" feature was broken

### Other changes

* Portable version of Spyder (inside WinPython):
    * Spyder '?' menu: added documentation detection (.chm, .pdf) in sys.prefix\Doc (Windows-only)
    * Project explorer:
        * Handling errors when opening a workspace which has been moved
        * Workspace is now configured with relative paths, so it can be moved from a location to another and still be opened in Spyder
* Windows: moved the functions hiding parent console to spyderlib/utils/windows.py


----


### Version 2.1.11

### Bug fixes

* Critical bugs:
    * Editor ([Issue 960](../../issues/960)): cannot open/save files from GUI (QFileDialog issue with PyQt4 v4.6)
* General:
    * Spyder menu bar: fixed menu ordering issue with Ubuntu/Unity
    * All console widgets: Shell widget: fixed "Clear terminal" (Ctrl+L) shortcut
* Console:
    * Cleaned up widget interactions after Python script execution (before this changeset, it was possible to send data to console, which not only was not needed but was generating disturbing errors in the internal console...)
* Editor:
    * If user accept to fix "mixed end-of-line characters", when opening file, the current editor was set as "modified" (the tab title had a `*` at the end) instead of the newly created editor
    * "occurrence highlighting" was highlighting previous word even if there was a whitespace between cursor and this word
    * Code analysis thread manager: handling errors while executing threads
    * "Replace all" was not regrouping changes into a single undo/redo step
    * "Find/Replace": replacements were not done for case unsensitive searches
    * Position of the 79-chars edge line is now more accurate on Linux, the older processed position was inaccurate with some font size of the classic "DejaVu Sans Mono" monospace font
* IPython:
    * Version detection was broken so Preferences...Console...External Modules was incorreclty hiding the command line options line edit
    * Because the detection was not working correctly, it was not possible to start an IPython kernel with the just released IPython 0.13
* Project explorer was sometimes producing AttributeError when loading because of the workspace was not defined at the beginning of the class constructor
* pyflakes code analysis function:
    * Handling files with invalid \x or null chars
    * This fixes a part of [Issue 1016](../../issues/1016) by handling the following pyflakes bugs:
      * http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=674796
      * http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=674797

### Other changes

* Installer for Windows (bdist_wininst/bdist_msi):
    * added Start Menu shortcuts
    * added 'pyflakes' and 'rope' (if available in the repository) to the package list (this is not conventional but Spyder really need those tools and there is not decent package manager on Windows platforms, so...)
    * This change will make the Spyder building process simpler for Windows as the Python(x,y) won't be needed anymore to provide Start Menu shortcuts or to install 'rope' and 'pyflakes' at the same time. Now, there is no significative difference between the standard installers built with distutils (bdist_wininst or bdist_msi options) and the Python(x,y) plugin, except for the "package upgrade" ability (uninstall previous version) which is still not (and won't be) supported by distutils.


----


## Version 2.1.10

### Bug fixes

* Critical bugs:
    * Spyder crashed at startup/TypeError: `_isdir()` takes exactly 1 argument (0 given). Affects only Windows platforms with Python 3.2.2+ or 2.7.3+)
    * Spyder was freezing when working with netCDF4 objects in the interactive console
    * Console: h5py was systematically imported to avoid crashes with the HDF5 plugin (Variable Explorer's I/O plugin). These ugly workarounds introduced with revision 3affc82ce081 were removed in this changeset to avoid side effects like DLL version conflict on Windows platforms. The main risk of this change is to break the HDF5 plugin on some configurations. But this is the best compromise.
* General:
    * Fixed regression: when no Qt library is installed (PyQt/PySide), warning the user with a Tkinter dialog box (if possible)
    * Fixed Preferences Dialog flickering issue introduced with revision a4e1565e93c5
    * Run configuration dialog: fixed Tab focus order behavior
    * Fixed "Run > Configure..." and "PYTHONPATH management" entry locations on MacOSX
    * Updated bootstrap script and Qt library selection logic to accommodate launch of Spyder using PySide while PyQt is also installed ([Issue 1013](../../issues/1013), see [Issue 975](../../issues/975) for additional background).
    * Fixed several encoding problems preventing Spyder from launching when the user's home directory contains non-ASCII characters ([Issue 812](../../issues/812), [Issue 1027](../../issues/2017)).
    * Debugging: [Issue 684](../../issues/684): Debug with winpdb will now use the command line options and working directory specified in the General Setting section of the Run Configuration dialog
* Console:
    * Changed "Clear shell" shortcut to "Ctrl+L" to avoid conflict with the Windows Task Manager shortcut on Windows platforms
    * Preferences/Advanced options: added option to start an IPython kernel at startup
* Editor:
    * When multiple files were open, close-clicking 1 file was closing 2 files on 64-bits OS
    * Conditional breakpoint could not be changed to regular breakpoint
    * Outline Explorer: removed obsolete decorated methods icon (a decorated method is now shown exactly as a regular method)
    * Top-left corner menu (file list): fixed common prefix removal feature
    * "Outline" item selection opened in incorrect split panel due to a lost signal when focus changed from an editor to another
    * when splitting window after changing a shortcut, old shortcut was still active
* Internal console/fixed an old regression: re-added help(), raw_input() support
* Profiler: tree was sometimes empty + fixed error when file path contained "&"
* File/Project explorer: fixed [by shchelokovskyy] Git commit/browse support
* Find in files: fixed crash due to a bug in the common prefix finder function

### Other changes

* Checked Spyder's `rope` patch compatibility with rope v0.9.4
* IPython plugin (experimental):
    * added support for "Execute in current interpreter"
    * added support for "Execute selection or block (F9)"
    * imports from local directory did not work
    * when a new kernel is started in Console, tabifying the frontend to the Console (for the first created frontend) and the next frontends to the previously created frontend
    * clients (frontends) may now really be closed (see context menu). The associated kernel and related clients may be closed as well (a message box dialog ask the user about this)
    * added support for the "Object Inspector to/from IPython kernel" link
    * improved reliability of the "Editor to/from IPython kernel" link
    * fixed focus management issue (link with variable explorer and object inspector)


----


## Version 2.1.9

### Bug fixes

* Run configuration/bugfix: command line options were not properly parsed
* Preferences dialog was not showing up with PySide installed *and* without PyQt4
* Editor:
    * Closing additional editor window produced traceback and primary editor breakdown
    * File/Open: embedded editor popped up even if there is one in a separate window
    * Selecting a part of a word raises an IndexError exception
    * Revert option was prompting for user input even on an unmodified buffer
    * Added missing .f77 file extensions for Fortran files filter
    * Occurrence highlighting was not working when cursor was at the left side of a word and if the next character was ':', ',' or '(' (or any other character not matching the "word regexp")
* Console:
    * Console was unusable (endless tracebacks) when monitor was disabled
    * File drag'n drop was not working (should execute dropped file)
* (Experimental) IPython plugin:
    * Fixed compatibility issues with PyQt4 and IPython 0.12
    * Fixed multiple instances issue (it was not possible to open more than one IPython frontend) and other issues
    * IPython kernel connections were unpredictable ([Issue 977](../../issues/977))
* Dictionary editor (Variable explorer): fixed UnboundLocalError when context menu is called on an empty table
* Object inspector failed to show an error message due to unicode error
* Project Explorer:
    * "Show all files" option was broken after restarting Spyder
    * It was impossible to create a project from an existing directory located outside the workspace


----


## Version 2.1.8

### Bug fixes

* Editor/Source code toolbar:
    * "Show task list" and "Go to the next task" actions: the "Show TODO/FIXME/XXX/HINT/TIP comments list" button was not working
    * "Show warning/error list" and "Go to the next warning/error" actions: the "Show code analysis warnings/errors" button was not working


----


## Version 2.1.7

### Bug fixes

* Main window:
    * Detached dockwidgets were not painted after restarting Spyder ([Issue 880](../../issues/880))
* Console:
    * Enhanced Python interpreter: %clear command was broken since v2.1.5
* Object inspector's rich text mode: fixed unexpected indent error
* IPython plugin: fixed compatibility issue with latest v0.12dev (thanks to Boris Gorelik)

### Other changes

* Variable explorer/Array editor: added support for masked arrays
* Showing Spyder's internal console automatically when there is a traceback
* Do not crash when a 3rd party plugin failed to import
* Editor:
    * Automatic insertion of single, double and triple quotes
    * Automatically colons insertion when pressing Enter after 'if', 'def', etc
    * Don't trigger code completion on comments if text ends with a dot
    * Added keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+Escape) to clear the console
    * Added keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+P) to print current file (thanks to fheday at gmail dot com for the contribution)
    * Code introspection features (code completion, calltips, go-to-definition) are now working even if script has syntax errors


----


## Version 2.1.6

### Bug fixes

* Critical bug on certain Windows platforms (not sure yet if it's related to a particular version of PyQt or something else): all plugins (dockwidgets) were shown detached (or hidden) from the mainwindow at startup (this is related to the attempt fixing [Issue 880](../../issues/880))


----


## Version 2.1.5

### Bug fixes

* Detached dockwidgets (Console, ...) were not painted after restarting Spyder
* Editor/Outline-bugfix: duplicate entries were shown when the editor was synchronizing file contents with disk
* File/Project explorer:
    * Fixed regression regarding [Issue 740](../../issues/740) (fixed in v2.1.0, re-introduced in v2.1.2): couldn't open files with non-ascii characters in their names
    * SCM support: commit/log actions were not working when right-clicking on a file instead of a folder
* Console:
    * Monitor/Introspection: fixed socket communication issue due to a MemoryError -- This error was mixing communication messages, causing various problems described in [Issue 857](../../issues/847) and [Issue 858](../../issues/858). This bug was reported by ruoyu0088, who also tried (and succeeded) to fix it and suggested a workaround which is implemented in this release
    * Fix critical console hang on OS X when using the "Run selection or current block feature" (see [Issue 502](../../issues/502))
    * Apply the right scheme color to the IPython console when there weren't any options provided by the user or when the only option was "-colors LightBG"
* Windows platforms:
    * "Preferences" dialog was not shown if account username contained non-ASCII characters
* Object Inspector:
    * Show signatures for docstrings sent from the Editor (see [Issue 690](../../issues/690))

### Other changes

* Debugging: when a non-empty SPYDER_DEBUG environment variable exists, Spyder switch to debug mode (log files are created in user's home directory and debug prints are available in the terminal)
* Variable explorer/Dictionary editor: added option to plot histogram from a 1-D array
* Console:
    * standard Python interpreter is now a real Python interactive session: the older implementation was running a startup script and tried to emulate a standard Python interactive session (changing attributes like __name__, running the PYTHONSTARTUP script, etc.). But this implementation was not close enough to the standard Python interactive session, i.e. when you execute `python` outside Spyder, without any argument. A recent bug report confirmed this: the PYTHONSTARTUP script was executed but not exactly the same way as it is outside Spyder: for example, doing `from __future__ import division` in the startup script had no effect whereas it did outside Spyder.
    * when running a standard Python interpreter, instead of running the startup script (spyderlib/widgets/externalshell/startup.py), the shell widget (ExternalPythonShell) simply runs the python executable with -u -i options, that's all. So now, the PYTHONSTARTUP script is executed as expected.
    * Scientific startup script (default PYTHONSTARTUP in Spyder): added floating point division (from __future__ import division)
    * PySide support:
        * Added new "Qt (PyQt/PySide)" settings group in "External modules" tab
        * It is now possible to select the Qt-Python bindings library: default (i.e. depends on the QT_API environment variable), PyQt or PySide
        * The PyQt input hook has been adapted for PySide, so it is now possible to do interactive (non-blocking) plotting with PySide
    * New options for standard Python interpreters (no effect on IPython):
        * "Merge process standard output/error channels": merging the output channels of the process means that the standard error won't be written in red anymore, but this has the effect of speeding up display
        * "Colorize standard error channel using ANSI escape codes": this method is the only way to have colorized standard error channel when the output channels have been merged
* Internal console ([Issue 868](../../issues/868)): output is now immediately available
* "Maximize current plugin" action: now automatically shows the "Outline" plugin when maximizing the "Editor" plugin
* Editor/Outline comment separators: allow space betwee hash and dash, e.g "# --- Outline Separator"


----


## Version 2.1.4

### Bug fixes

* Console:
    * *Critical bugfix* for IPython support: variable explorer link was broken (regression introduced with v2.1.3)

### Other changes

* Console:
    * option "Open an IPython interperter at startup" is now *explicitely* disabled for IPython v0.11+ (these versions of IPython are not fully supported through Spyder's console plugin)


----


## Version 2.1.3

### Enhancements

* Variable explorer performance were improved, especially when dealing with very long sequences -- See [this discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/spyderlib/browse_thread/thread/3a7ef892695e417a)
* Variable explorer / dictionary editor: added support for unknown objects -- this allows browsing any object attributes -- This is still experimental.

### Bug fixes

* General:
    * Spyder preferences/bugfix: comboboxes with keys other than strings (e.g. the PyQt API selection combo box) were not initialized properly
    * Fixed memory leaks (QThread objects) in the "Editor" and "Find in files" plugins. In those two plugins, QThread objects were created, then started but were never garbage-collected after they finished their execution
* Editor:
    * Supported file types: added missing C++ file extensions (.cc, .hh, .hxx)
* Variable explorer:
    * Debugging: added support for editing objects within functions
    * Debugging: when debugging, variable explorer link was broken after restarting program
    * handling errors when trying to enable/disable autorefresh (if one of the running console has no monitor enabled)
* Project explorer:
    * when the workspace has not yet been defined, creating a new project not only warns the user but also proposes to set it right away


----


## Version 2.1.2

### Bug fixes

* General:
    * Patched external path library to avoid a crash with a user HOME directory with non-ascii characters
    * Doc/README: warning the user about the fact that the 'python setup.py install' method does not uninstall a previous version
* Console:
    * Fixed "AccessInit: hash collision: 3 for both 1 and 1" error (see [Issue 595](../../issues/595))
* Project explorer:
    * empty workspace/critical bugfix: impossible to create/import projects from context menu (this bug was introduced with a recent revision and stayed unnoticed until then because one has to test this from an empty workspace)
    * it is now possible to rename projects (safely)
    * now handling the I/O errors (e.g. read-only configuration files) occuring when loading/saving projects or the workspace: warning the user when an IOError exception was raised and mention the projects which could not be saved properly
* File/Project explorer:
    * keyboard shortcut 'F2' (rename file/directory) was broken
    * the "Open" action (context menu) was failing silently for directories (expected behavior: open an external file explorer to browse the directory)
    * programs.start_file/bugfix: feature was not working on Windows 7
* Editor:
    * Fix empty username in new file template on OS X (patch by Christoph Gohle)
* Object inspector:
    * Rich text mode was not showing headings when invoked from editor ([Issue 690](../../issues/690))

### Enhancements

* File/Project explorer:
    * Added "Delete" keyboard shortcut to remove selected file(s)/folder(s)
    * SCM integration: added support for TortoiseHg v2 (only v1 was supported)
* Console/Matplotlib options: the backend may now be set separately from the Matplotlib patch

### Other changes

* Console:
    * The Matplotlib patch is only applied for Matplotlib <=v1.0
    * PyQt API version issues (error like "ValueError: API 'QString' has already been set to version 1"): the "ignore setapi errors" option is disabled by default, to avoid masking these errors and associated tracebacks


----


## Version 2.1.1

_Note:_ v2.1.1 is a minor update of v2.1.0 (licence issues and minor bug fixes)

Follow Spyder news on our official blog:
http://spyder-ide.blogspot.com/

### Compatibility/Requirements

Since version 2.1:
* Spyder is now compatible with:
    * PyQt's API v1 (i.e. compatible with PyQt 4.4 and 4.5), the default Python 2 API
    * *and* PyQt's API v2 (this is the future: default Python 3 API and PySide-compatible API)
    * *and* with PySide (PySide support is still experimental as this library is still young but its stability is evolving rapidly)
* Editor/code analysis: Spyder now requires *pyflakes v0.5.0* (included in Windows installers).

### New features since v2.0.12

* New *Profiler* plugin (thanks to Santiago Jaramillo)
* New experimental *IPython* plugin embedding IPython's Qt console: see [here](http://spyder-ide.blogspot.com/2011/08/preview-of-new-ipython-plugin-for.html)
* General:
    * Main window:
        * added "Custom window layouts" management (see menu "View")/handling 3 custom layouts: default shortcuts Shift+Alt+FX to switch to/from layout #X and Ctrl+Shift+Alt+FX to set layout #X
        * "General" preferences page: added option to set the Qt windows style, depending on platform (Plastique, Cleanlooks, CDE, Windows...)
        * Menu "?": added menu entry to report Spyder issues, filling automatically informations on your configuration
        * Reorganized "Run"/"Source" menu, added "Interpreters" menu
        * Fixed application name for Gnome 3/Fedora 15
* Command line options: added option "--defaults" to reset settings (stored in .spyder.ini) to defaults (a lot of settings are preserved: shortcuts, window layouts, ...) -- this is less brutal than "--reset" which reset all settings by removing all configuration files related to Spyder
* *Outline* (function/class browser) is now a plugin in itself, embedded in its own dockwidget: Spyder's window layout is even more customizable than before
* *Code completion*
    * (Editor/Console): entries starting with an underscore character are now placed to the end of the suggested list
    * (Editor/Console): Import statements are now completed correctly
* *Console*:
    * Major code cleaning: running Python applications in Spyder has never been cleaner and is very close to a simple Python interpreter
    * Added built-in function `open_in_spyder` to open a file in Spyder's source code editor from the console
    * Standard Python interpreter:
        * now refresh the variable explorer at each new prompt (even if auto-refresh is disabled -- actually, this is the typical use case)
        * added support for basic special commands (%pwd, %ls, %clear) and system commands (starting with '!', e.g. !dir or !ls)
        * added ["scientific" startup script](http://spyder-ide.blogspot.com/2011/09/new-enhanced-scientific-python.html) with support for numpy, scipy and matplotlib
    * Preferences (External modules tab):
        * added an option to set PyQt API to v1 or v2 -- this avoids issues with Enthought Tool Suite or any other library/program using PyQt API v2 which is *not* the default API for Python 2
        * changed matplotlib patch to fix compatiblity issue with PyQt API v2
    * Preferences (Advanced Settings tab): added option "Python executable" to customize path to Python interpreter executable binary
* *Variable explorer*:
    * New HDF5 plugin by [DavidAnthonyPowell](http://code.google.com/u/DavidAnthonyPowell/): import/export HDF5 files to/from the variable explorer
    * Dictionary editor/Variable explorer:
        * Added support for more NumPy data types
        * Added action "Resize rows to contents" (partially implements feature requested with [Issue 807](../../issues/807))
* *Editor*:
    * find/replace:
        * added support for *multiline* regular expression search pattern
        * added support for *multiline* regular expression text replacement
        * added button "Highlight matches" to highlight all found results
    * syntax highlighting: added support for OpenCL, gettext files, patch/diff files, CSS and HTML files
    * support for "2 spaces" and "tabs" indentation characters
    * new code analysis feature: added support for the [pep8](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8) style guide checker
    * "Comment" and "Uncomment" actions were replaced by a single "Comment/Uncommment" toggle action
    * (Fixes  [Issue 811](../../issues/811) ) "Run configuration": added "Run in an external system terminal" option
* *File explorer* and *Project explorer*:
    * great performance improvement (using a multithreaded file system model)
    * Added minimalist SCM support (Mercurial and git are currently supported)
* *File explorer*: added an option to "Show current directory only"
* *Project explorer*: this plugin was entirely rewritten to improve performances and usability
* *Pylint plugin*:
    * added option to save file before analyzing it
* Spyder's console embedded in your application (spyderlib.widgets.internalshell):
    * in traceback, a clickable link now opens the associated file in Spyder (if application was launched from Spyder with monitor enabled)
    * Application sample embedding Spyder's internal shell: upgraded to guidata v1.4+ (simplified build script a lot)
* Windows platforms specific changes:
    * (requires pywin32) Hiding the attached console window:
        * allow running Spyder with 'python.exe' without visible console (this avoid using 'pythonw.exe' which does not attach a console to the process, hence preventing standard I/O to be redirected in a subprocess executed within Spyder, e.g. in your own program)
        * the attached console may be shown/hidden from menu entry "View > Attached console window (debugging)"
* Major change for Windows/PyQt users: standard Python interpreter now supports interactive GUI manipulations thanks to a new Spyder-specific input hook (replacing PyQt's input hook which is not working within Spyder on Windows platforms) -- the input hook works even better than PyQt's builtin input hook (with a Python interpreter opened outside Spyder)
* Spyder's stand-alone version building process was improved. This version is now available on project's download page.

### Bug fixes (since v2.0.12)

* Spyder's main window:
    * QtDesigner and QtLinguist were not detected on Fedora
    * Console/Editor: code completion widget was partially hidden when working on two monitors and if Spyder's window was on the right screen
    * Fixed bugs due to too early/frequent calls to plugin refresh methods during startup
* Console:
    * IPython Interpreter: Turn off autoindent magic to avoid indentation errors with code with inline comments
* Editor:
    * Fortran syntax highlighter was made case insensitive
    * Fixed IndentationError when running first line of a file
    * Read only files allowed ".", "[", "(", etc. to be entered into the text editor
    * Fixed segmentation faults occuring after using the vertical-horizontal splitting feature
    * If a file name had non-ascii characters then code completion (and all other rope-based features) in the editor stopped working
    * Code analysis: fixed tasks pattern (for example, previous one was matching "TIP" in "MULTIPLICATION"... now it will match only single "TIP:" or "TIP ")
    * (Fixes  [Issue 704](../../issues/704)) Outline was showing the delimiters of block comments ('#------...-'), causing nesting inconsistencies because block comments are not indented properly with respect to the code around
    * Fixed several bugs with the "Run selection or current block" feature.
* Object inspector:
    * Rich text mode was failing for non-ascii docstrings
* Find/Replace widget:
    * Combo box history was populated only when pressing Enter (now pressing F3 to find next occurrence will add the current entry to history)


----

* Editor/fixed unexpected behavior: when some text was selected, "Ctrl+Left mouse click" was trying to "go to definition" instead of doing the standard drag n'drop feature
* Editor/bugfix: disabling code completion/calltips for non-Python source code (was not working -as expected- but was taking time to simply not work...)
* Editor/go to line: fixed unicode error
* Code editor/bugfix: cursor position was not restored when undoing an indent operation with "tab always indent" feature turned on *and* the cursor at the end of the line
* Tab behavior when "tab always indents" is turned off: inserting 4-(len(leading_text) % 4) spaces (instead of 4)

----


## Version 2.0.6

### Bug fixes

* Console: menu entries "Environment variables", "Current working directory" and "Show sys.path" were not disabled when the Monitor was turned off
* Preferences dialog box/Keyboard shortcuts:
    * conflicts are now ignored if shortcuts have different contexts *except* if one of this context is '`_`' (i.e. global context)
    * conflict warnings are now also shown when showing the preferences dialog box (not only when modifying shortcuts and applying changes)
* Drag/drop Python script to console: fixed TypeError (TypeError: start() got an unexpected keyword argument 'ask_for_arguments')

* Editor: code completion was sometimes very slow when editing files within a Spyder project
* Code editor: fixed "Delete line" feature (Ctrl+D) / was not working with multiline selection

### Other changes

* Editor/80-column vertical edge line: added options to show/hide this line and change the column number
* Editor: added "Comment"/"Uncomment" actions to context menu
* Source code and shell editor widgets: code refactoring/cleaning (this should help people using these widgets outside Spyder)
These are some instructions meant for maintainers of this repo.

* To avoid pushing to our main repo by accident, please use `https` for your `usptream` remote. That should make git to ask for your credentials (at least in Unix systems).
* After merging a PR against the stable branch (e.g. `5.x`), you need to immediately merge it against `master` and push your changes to Github.
  For that you need to perform the following steps in your local clone:

    - git checkout 5.x
    - git fetch upstream
    - git merge upstream/5.x
    - git checkout master
    - git merge 5.x
    - Commit with the following message:

          Merge from 5.x: PR #<pr-number>

          Fixes #<fixed-issue-number>

      If the PR doesn't fix any issue, the second line is unnecessary.
    - git push upstream master

* To merge against `master` a PR that involved updating our spyder-kernels subrepo in the stable branch (e.g. `5.x`), you need to perform the following actions:

    - git checkout master
    - git merge 5.x
    - git reset -- external-deps/spyder-kernels
    - git checkout -- external-deps/spyder-kernels
    - git commit with the files left and the same message format as above.
    - git subrepo pull external-deps/spyder-kernels

* If a PR in spyder-kernels solves an issue in Spyder but was not part of a PR that updated its subrepo, you need to open one that does precisely that, i.e. update its subrepo, in order to fix that issue.

    The same goes for the python-lsp-server subrepo.

* There's a bot that constantly monitors all issues in order to close duplicates or already solved issues and inform users what they can do about them (basically wait to be fixed or update).

    The patterns detected by the bot and the messages shown to users can be configured in `.github/workflows/duplicates.yml` (only avaiable in our `master` branch because there's no need to have it in `5.x`).

    Please open a PR to add new messages or update previous ones, so other members of the team can decide if the messages are appropriate.

## Help support Spyder, the community-developed scientific IDE!

Spyder development is made possible by contributions from our global user
community, along with organizations like [NumFOCUS](https://www.numfocus.org)
and [Quansight](https://www.quansight.com).
There are numerous [ways you can help](
https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Contributing-to-Spyder), many of
which don't require any programming. If you'd like to make a [donation](
https://opencollective.com/spyder/donate) to help fund further improvements,
we're on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/spyder).

Thanks for all you do to make the Spyder project thrive! [More details](
https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Current-Funding-and-Development-Status)



----

## Overview

Spyder is a powerful scientific environment written in Python, for Python,
and designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts. It offers a
unique combination of the advanced editing, analysis, debugging, and profiling
functionality of a comprehensive development tool with the data exploration,
interactive execution, deep inspection, and beautiful visualization
capabilities of a scientific package.

Beyond its many built-in features, its abilities can be extended even further
via its plugin system and API. Furthermore, Spyder can also be used as a PyQt5
extension library, allowing you to build upon its functionality and embed
its components, such as the interactive console, in your own software.

For more general information about Spyder and to stay up to date on the
latest Spyder news and information, please check out [our new website](
https://www.spyder-ide.org/).


## Core components

* **Editor**

    Work efficiently in a multi-language editor with a function/class browser,
    real-time code analysis tools (`pyflakes`, `pylint`, and `pycodestyle`),
    automatic code completion (`jedi` and `rope`),
    horizontal/vertical splitting, and go-to-definition.

* **Interactive console**

    Harness the power of as many IPython consoles as you like with full
    workspace and debugging support, all within the flexibility of a full
    GUI interface. Instantly run your code by line, cell, or file,
    and render plots right inline with the output or in interactive windows.

* **Documentation viewer**

    Render documentation in real-time with Sphinx for any class or function,
    whether external or user-created, from either the Editor or a Console.

* **Variable explorer**

    Inspect any variables, functions or objects created during your session.
    Editing and interaction is supported with many common types, including
    numeric/strings/bools, Python lists/tuples/dictionaries, dates/timedeltas,
    Numpy arrays, Pandas index/series/dataframes, PIL/Pillow images, and more.

* **Development tools**

    Examine your code with the static analyzer, trace its execution with the
    interactive debugger, and unleash its performance with the profiler.
    Keep things organized with project support and a built-in file explorer, and
    use find in files to search across entire projects with full regex support.


## Documentation

You can read the Spyder documentation online on [the Spyder Docs website](
https://docs.spyder-ide.org/).


## Installation

For a detailed guide to installing Spyder, please refer to our
[installation instructions](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/installation.html).

The easiest way to install Spyder on any of our supported platforms
is to download it as part of the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
distribution, and use the `conda` package and environment manager to keep it
and your other packages installed and up to date.

If in doubt, you should always install Spyder via this method to avoid
unexpected issues we are unable to help you with; it generally has the
least likelihood of potential pitfalls for non-experts, and we may be
able to provide limited assistance if you do run into trouble.

Other installation options exist, including:

* The [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/) distribution for Windows
* The [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) project for macOS
* Your distribution's package manager (i.e. `apt-get`, `yum`, etc) on Linux
* The `pip` package manager, included with most Python installations

**However**, we lack the resources to provide individual support for users who
install via these methods, and they may be out of date or contain bugs outside
our control, so we recommend the Anaconda version instead if you run into issues.


## Troubleshooting

Before posting a report, *please* carefully read our **[Troubleshooting Guide](
https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Troubleshooting-Guide-and-FAQ)**
and search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues)
for your error message and problem description, as the great majority of bugs
are either duplicates, or can be fixed on the user side with a few easy steps.
Thanks!

## Running from a git clone

Please see the instructions in our
[Contributing guide](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#setting-up-a-development-environment)
to learn how to do run Spyder after cloning its repo from Github.

## Dependencies

**Important Note**: Most or all of the dependencies listed below come
with *Anaconda* and other scientific Python distributions, so you don't need
to install them separately in those cases.

### Build dependencies

When installing Spyder from its source package, the only requirement is to have
a Python version equal or greater than 3.6.

### Runtime dependencies

The basic dependencies to run Spyder are:

* **Python** 3.6+: The core language Spyder is written in and for.
* **PyQt5** 5.6+: Python bindings for Qt, used for Spyder's GUI.

The rest our dependencies (both required and optional) are declared in
[this file](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/spyder/dependencies.py).

Accordingly, please read the [relevant section](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Troubleshooting-Guide-and-FAQ#calling-for-help-still-have-a-problem) of the Spyder Troubleshooting Guide, which describes in detail how to do just that.

Most importantly, aside from the error message/traceback and the requested environment/dependency information, *please* be sure you include a detailed, step by step description of exactly what triggered the problem. Otherwise, we likely won't be able to find and fix it, and your issue will have to be closed after a week (7 days). Thanks!


## Setting Up a Development Environment

### Forking and cloning the repo

First, navigate to the [Spyder repo](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder) in your web browser and press the ``Fork`` button to make a personal copy of the repository on your own Github account.
Then, click the ``Clone or Download`` button on your repository, copy the link and run the following on the command line to clone the repo:

```bash
$ git clone <LINK-TO-YOUR-REPO>
```

Finally, set the upstream remote to the official Spyder repo with:

```bash
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder.git
```

### Creating a conda environment or virtualenv

If you use Anaconda you can create a conda environment with the following commands:

```bash
$ conda create -n spyder-dev python=3
$ conda activate spyder-dev
```

You can also use `virtualenv` on Linux, but `conda` is **strongly** recommended:

```bash
$ mkvirtualenv spyder-dev
$ workon spyder-dev
```


### Installing dependencies

After you have created your development environment, you need to install Spyder's necessary dependencies. The easiest way to do so (with Anaconda) is

```bash
$ conda install -c conda-forge --file requirements/conda.txt
```

This installs all Spyder's dependencies into the environment.
If you are running on macOS, you will also need to install `python.app`.

```bash
$ conda install python.app
```

If using `pip` and `virtualenv` (not recommended), you need to `cd` to the directory where your git clone is stored and run:

```bash
$ pip install -e .
```

### Running Spyder

To start Spyder directly from your clone, i.e. without installing it into your environment, you need to run (from the directory you cloned it to e.g. `spyder`):

```bash
$ python bootstrap.py
```
Note that if you are running on macOS, you will need to call `pythonw` instead of `python`.

To start Spyder in debug mode, useful for tracking down an issue, you can run:

```bash
$ python bootstrap.py --debug
```

**Important Note**: To test any changes you've made to the Spyder source code, you need to restart Spyder or start a fresh instance (you can run multiple copies simultaneously by unchecking the Preferences option <kbd>Use a single instance</kbd> under <kbd>General</kbd> > <kbd>Advanced Settings</kbd> .


###  Running tests

To install our test dependencies under Anaconda:

```bash
$ conda install -c conda-forge --file requirements/tests.txt
```

If using `pip` (for experts only), run the following from the directory where your git clone is stored:

```bash
$ pip install -e .[test]
```

To run the Spyder test suite, please use (from the `spyder` root directory):

```bash
$ python runtests.py
```


## Spyder Branches

When you start to work on a new pull request (PR), you need to be sure that your work is done on top of the correct Spyder branch, and that you base your PR on Github against it.

To guide you, issues on Github are marked with a milestone that indicates the correct branch to use. If not, follow these guidelines:

* Use the `5.x` branch for bugfixes only (*e.g.* milestones `v5.0.1` or `v5.1.2`)
* Use `master` to introduce new features or break compatibility with previous Spyder versions (*e.g.* milestones `v6.0beta1` or `v6.0beta2`).

You should also submit bugfixes to `5.x` or `master` for errors that are only present in those respective branches.

To start working on a new PR, you need to execute these commands, filling in the branch names where appropriate:

```bash
$ git checkout <SPYDER-BASE-BRANCH>
$ git pull upstream <SPYDER-BASE-BRANCH>
$ git checkout -b <NAME-NEW-BRANCH>
```


### Changing the base branch

If you started your work in the wrong base branch, or want to backport it, you can change the base branch using `git rebase --onto`, like this:

```bash
$ git rebase --onto <NEW-BASE-BRANCH> <OLD-BASE-BRANCH> <YOUR-BRANCH>
```

For example, backporting `my_branch` from `master` to `5.x`:

```bash
$ git rebase --onto 5.x master my_branch
```


## Making contributions that depend on pull requests in spyder-kernels

Spyder and spyder-kernels are developed jointly because a lot of communication happens between them in order to run code written in the editor in the IPython console. The way the branches on their respective repos are linked appears in the table below:

| Spyder branch       | Associated spyder-kernels branch  |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 5.x                 | 2.x                               |
| master (future 6.x) | master (future 3.x)               |

For this reason, a clone of spyder-kernels is placed in the `external-deps` subfolder of the Spyder repository. The instructions on this section will help you in case you need to make changes that touch both repositories at the same time.

The first thing you need to do is cloning the [git-subrepo](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo) project and follow these instructions to install it (on Windows you need to use Git Bash in order to run them):

```
git clone https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo /path/to/git-subrepo
echo 'source /path/to/git-subrepo/.rc' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

As an example, let's assume that (i) your Github user name is `myuser`; (ii) you have two git repositories placed at `~/spyder` and `~/spyder-kernels` that link to `https://github.com/myuser/spyder` and `https://github.com/myuser/spyder-kernels` respectively; and (iii) you have two branches named `fix_in_spyder` and `fix_in_kernel` in each of these git repos respectively. If you want to open a joint PR in `spyder` and `spyder-kernels` that link these branches, here is how to do it:

* Go to the `~/spyder` folder, checkout your `fix_in_spyder` branch and replace the spyder-kernels clone in the `external-deps` subfolder by a clone of your `fix_in_kernel` branch:

    ```
    $ cd ~/spyder
    $ git checkout fix_in_spyder
    $ git subrepo clone https://github.com/myuser/spyder-kernels.git external-deps/spyder-kernels -b fix_in_kernel -f
    ```

* You can now open a PR on `https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder` and on `https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-kernels` for each of your branches.

* If you make additional changes to the `fix_in_kernel` branch in `spyder-kernels` (e.g. adding a new file, as in the example below), you need to sync them in your Spyder's `fix_in_spyder` branch like this:

    ```
    $ cd ~/spyder-kernels
    $ git checkout fix_in_kernel
    $ touch foo.py
    $ git add -A
    $ git commit -m "Adding foo.py to the repo"
    $ git push origin fix_in_kernel

    $ cd ~/spyder
    $ git checkout fix_in_spyder
    $ git subrepo clone https://github.com/myuser/spyder-kernels.git external-deps/spyder-kernels -b fix_in_kernel -f
    $ git push origin fix_in_spyder
    ```

* When your `fix_in_kernel` PR is merged, you need to update Spyder's `fix_in_spyder` branch because the clone in Spyder's repo must point out again to the spyder-kernel's repo and not to your own clone. For that, please run:

    ```
    $ git subrepo clone https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-kernels.git external-deps/spyder-kernels -b <branch> -f
    ```

where `<branch>` needs to be `2.x` if your `fix_in_spyder` branch was done against Spyder's `5.x` branch; and `master`, if you did it against our `master` branch here.


## Making contributions that depend on pull requests in python-lsp-server

As with spyder-kernels, Spyder is tightly integrated with the [python-lsp-server](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server) to provide code completion, linting and folding on its editor.

Due to that, a clone of that project is placed in the `external-deps` directory, which is managed with the `git subrepo` project. If you want to make a pull request in python-lsp-server that affects functionality in Spyder, please read carefully the instructions in the previous section because they are very similar for this case. A summary of those instructions applied to this project is the following:

* First you need to create a pull request in python-lsp-server with the changes you want to make there. Let's assume the branch from which that pull request is created is called `fix_in_pyls`.

* Then you need to create a branch in Spyder (let's call it `fix_in_spyder`) with the fixes that require that pull request and update the python-lsp-server subrepo. For that you need to execute the following commands:

    ```
    $ git checkout -b fix_in_spyder
    $ git subrepo clone https://github.com/myuser/python-lsp-server.git external-deps/python-lsp-server -b fix_in_pylsp -f
    ```

    and then commit the changes you need to make in Spyder.

* If you need to add more commits to `fix_in_pylsp`, you need to update `fix_in_spyder` with these commands:

    ```
    $ git checkout fix_in_spyder
    $ git subrepo clone https://github.com/myuser/python-lsp-server.git external-deps/python-lsp-server -b fix_in_pylsp -f
    $ git push origin fix_in_spyder
    ```

* After `fix_in_pylsp` is merged, you need to update the python-lsp-server subrepo in your `fix_in_spyder` branch with

    ```
    $ git checkout fix_in_spyder
    $ git subrepo clone https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server.git external-deps/python-lsp-server -b develop -f
    ```


## Adding Third-Party Content

All files or groups of files, including source code, images, icons, and other assets, that originate from projects outside of the Spyder organization (regardless of the license), must be first approved by the Spyder team. Always check with us (on Github, Gitter, Google Group, etc) before attempting to add content from an external project, and only do so when necessary.


### Licenses

Code considered for inclusion must be under a permissive (i.e. non-copyleft) license, particularly as the following (in order of preference):

* MIT (Expat)
* Public domain (preferably, CC0)
* ISC license
* BSD 2-clause ("Simplified BSD")
* BSD 3-clause ("New" or "Modified BSD")
* Apache License 2.0

Additionally, external assets (fonts, icons, images, sounds, animations) can generally be under one of the following weak-copyleft and content licenses:

* Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 or 4.0
* SIL Open Font License 1.1
* GNU LGPL 2.1 or 3.0

Additional licenses *may* qualify for these lists from time to time, but every effort should be made to avoid it. Regardless, all such licenses must be OSI, FSF, and DSFG approved as well as GPLv3-compatible to ensure maximum free distribution and use of Spyder with minimum ambiguity or fragmentation.


### Steps to take

1. Contact the Spyder team to ensure the usage is justified and compatible.

2. Add the files, preserving any original copyright/legal/attribution header

3. If making non-trivial modifications, copy the standard Spyder copyright header from ``.ciocopyright`` to just below the original headers; if the original headers are unformatted and just consist of a copyright statement and perhaps mention of the license, incorporate them verbatim within the Spyder header where appropriate. Always ensure copyright statements are in ascending chronological order, and replace the year in the Spyder copyright statement with the current one. Modify the license location to be the current directory, or NOTICE.txt.

4. Include the following line at the end of each module's docstring, separated by blank lines:

   ```rst
   Adapted from path/to/file/in/original/repo.py of the
   `Project Name <url-to-original-github-repo>`_.
   ```

   For example,

   ```rst
   Adapted from qcrash/_dialogs/gh_login.py of the
   `QCrash Project <https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QCrash>`_.
   ```

5. Convert the files to project standards where needed.

6. If the copied file(s) reside in a directory dedicated to them, place the source project's LICENSE.txt file there, and any other legal files. Also, mention the same in the __init__.py file in that directory.

7. Add an entry in NOTICE.txt with the instructions and template there.

8. If a non-code visible asset (icons, fonts, animations, etc) or otherwise under a Creative Commons license, include a mention in the appropriate section of the README, as well as Spyder's About dialog, in the same form as the others present there.

# Instructions to release a new Spyder version

To release a new version of Spyder you need to follow these steps:

## Update translation strings (at least one week before the release)

* Install [gettext-helpers](https://github.com/spyder-ide/gettext-helpers) from source.

* Create a new PR to update our `*.pot` and `*.po` files by running

      spyder-gettext scan spyder

* Check that no warnings are emitted by that command. If they are, then fix them in the same PR.

* Merge that PR.

* Close the current translation PR, i.e. the one with the title `New Crowdin updates`.

* Delete the `translate/<branch-name>` branch associated to that PR.

* Go to the integrations page on Crowdin:

  https://crowdin.com/project/spyder/apps/system/github

* Press `Sync now` there to open a new translation PR.

* Send a message to translators on Crowdin to update their translations:

  https://crowdin.com/messages

  An example of that message can be found in

  https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/14117

## Before starting the release

### Merge translations from Crowdin

* Checkout the translations branch with

      git checkout translate/<branch-name>

* Squash all commits in that branch to leave only one with the command

      git rebase --interactive HEAD~N

  where N is the number of commits on it.

* Change the commit message with

      git commit --amend

  to be `Update and compile translations [ci skip]`

* Generate the `mo` files by running

      spyder-gettext compile spyder

* Remove `mo` files that are still not part of version control.

* Add those files to the previous commit with

      git add .
      git commit --amend --no-edit

* Push your changes to the translation PR with

      git push -f upstream translate/<branch-name>

* Rename the PR title to be `PR: Update translations from Crowdin`.

* Merge the PR.

* Don't forget to remove your local checkout of `translate/<branch-name>` because that's going to be outdated for next time.

* Update the `master` branch with

      git checkout 5.x
      git fetch upstream
      git merge upstream/5.x
      git checkout master
      git merge 5.x
      Merge from 5.x: PR #xxxxx
      git push upstream master

### Update core dependencies

* Release a new version of `spyder-kernels`, if required.

* Release a new version of `python-lsp-server`, if required.

* Merge PRs on Conda-forge that update the `spyder-kernels` and `python-lsp-server` feedstocks (usually an automatic PR will appear that can be either merged as it is or be use as boilerplate):

  - `spyder-kernels`: https://github.com/conda-forge/spyder-kernels-feedstock

  - `python-lsp-server`: https://github.com/conda-forge/python-lsp-server-feedstock

  **Notes**:

  - Review carefully the release notes of those packages to see if it's necessary to add new dependencies or update the constraints on the current ones (e.g. `jedi >=0.17.2`).

* Create a new branch in your fork with the name `update-core-deps`

* Update the version of any packages required before the release in the following files:

  - `setup.py`
  - `spyder/dependencies.py`
  - `requirements/conda.txt`
  - `binder/environment.yml`
  - `spyder/plugins/ipythonconsole/widgets/main_widget.py` (look up for the constants `SPYDER_KERNELS_MIN_VERSION` and `SPYDER_KERNELS_MAX_VERSION`)

* Commit with

      git add .
      git commit -m "Update core dependencies"

* Update our subrepos with the following commands, but only if new versions are available!

      git subrepo pull external-deps/spyder-kernels
      git subrepo pull external-deps/python-lsp-server

* Merge this PR following the procedure mentioned on [`MAINTENANCE.md`](MAINTENANCE.md)

## To do the release

* Close the current milestone on Github

* git pull or git fetch/merge

* Update CHANGELOG.md with `loghub spyder-ide/spyder -m vX.X.X`

* Add sections for `New features`, `Important fixes` and `New API features` in CHANGELOG.md. For this take a look at closed issues and PRs for the current milestone.

* `git add .` and `git commit -m "Update Changelog"`

* Update Announcements.md (this goes to our Google group) removing the outdated announcement of the same kind (major, minor, or beta/release candidate)

* `git add .` and `git commit -m "Update Announcements"`

* `git clean -xfdi` and select option `1`.

* Update version in `__init__.py` (set release version, remove 'dev0')

* `git add .` and `git commit -m "Release X.X.X"`

* python setup.py sdist

* Activate environment with pip packages only

* pip install -U pip setuptools twine wheel

* python setup.py bdist_wheel

* twine check dist/*

* twine upload dist/*

* Check in PyPI that the new release was published correctly

* git tag -a vX.X.X -m 'Release X.X.X'

* Update version in `__init__.py` (add 'dev0' and increment minor)

* `git add .` and `git commit -m "Back to work [ci skip]"`

* git checkout master

* git merge 5.x

* git commit -m "Release X.X.X [ci skip]"

* git push upstream master

* git push upstream 5.x

* git push upstream --tags


## After the release

* Publish release in our Github Releases page:
  - Copy the contents of the previous release description (updating the relevant information and links to point to the new Spyder version and changelog entry).
  - Edit the previous release description to only have the changelog line.

* Publish release announcement to our [list](https://groups.google.com/group/spyderlib) (following [Announcements.md](Announcements.md)) after the installers have been built.

* Merge PR on Conda-forge for Spyder. For that you can go to

  https://github.com/conda-forge/spyder-feedstock

  and merge the corresponding PR for the new release (usually an automatic PR will appear that can be either merged as it is or be use as boilerplate).

  **Notes**:

  - Don't forget to add new dependencies and update constraints on the rest of them. For that, you need to compare line by line the contents of the `recipe/meta.yaml` file in the feedstock with

    https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/5.x/requirements/conda.txt
  - After merging, give a ping to `@anaconda-pkg-build` about the new release.

## How to build the Spyder MacOS X application

**Important note**: These instructions have only been tested on MacOS X 10.14 and above

To build the Spyder standalone Mac application you need:
* Python 3.x installed, *not* from Anaconda

Once you have the above requirements, you will create a virtual environment from which to build the application.

### Python 3.x installation

In principle, it doesn't matter where your Python installation comes from except that it cannot come from Anaconda.
I do not know exactly why an Anaconda installation does not work except that it has something to do with hardlinks.

I recommend using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv (if you plan to use these for virtual environment management).
If you plan to use pyenv, you don't even need to install Python from Homebrew, since pyenv will install whatever python version you request.
If you don't plan to use pyenv, then you will need to install Python from Homebrew or elsewhere.

After installing Homebrew, run:

```
$ brew install pyenv, pyenv-virtualenv, xz
```

`xz` is a package that provides compression algorithms that Python should be built with to satisfy some packages, namely `pandas`.

The Python frameworks must be copied to the stand-alone application, so if you use pyenv you must enable frameworks in any Python installation that you plan to use to build the Spyder app.

```
$ PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-framework pyenv install <python version>
```

### Create Virtual Environment

If you currently have any conda environment(s) activated, then deactivate them completely, i.e. you should not be in any conda environment, not even base.

Create the virtual environment and populate it with the necessary package requirements.
If you are using pyenv with pyenv-virtualenv, it will look like this:

```
$ pyenv virtualenv <python version> spy-build
$ pyenv activate spy-build
```

If you are using venv, creating the environment will look like this:

```
$ python -m venv --clear --copies spy-build
$ source spy-build/bin/activate
```

Now change your working directory to `installers/macOS` directory of your local Spyder repo and install the necessary packages.

```
(spy-build) $ cd <path>/<to>/spyder/installers/macOS
(spy-build) $ pip install -r req-build.txt -r req-extras.txt -c req-const.txt -e ../../
(spy-build) $ pip uninstall -q -y spyder
```

This will install the packages required for building Spyder and extra packages like matplotlib.
Spyder is installed from this repository for the sole purpose of getting all of its dependencies.
It must be uninstalled since py2app will use the repository when creating the application bundle.

`req-build.txt` contains only those packages required to build the stand-alone application.
`req-extras.txt` contains optional packages to include, if desired, for use in IPython consoles launched from the "Same as Spyder" environment.
If you use external environments, such as conda, for your IPython consoles, you don't need `req-extras.txt`.
The build command also provides an option to exclude these packages, so you may install them and still build the application without them.
`req-const.txt` contains package constraints that are known to cause problems with the build process if not satisfied.

### Create the Standalone Application

To create the standalone application and package it in a dmg disk image run:

```
(spy-build) $ python setup.py --dmg
```

Further usage documentation can be accessed via

```
(spy-build) $ python setup.py -h
```

After a whole lot of screen dump, and if everything went well, you should now have two files in the `installers/macOS/dist` directory of your local Spyder repository:
* Spyder.app
* Spyder.dmg

# Python LSP Server

[![image](https://github.com/python-ls/python-ls/workflows/Linux%20tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/python-ls/python-ls/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Linux+tests%22) [![image](https://github.com/python-ls/python-ls/workflows/Mac%20tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/python-ls/python-ls/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Mac+tests%22) [![image](https://github.com/python-ls/python-ls/workflows/Windows%20tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/python-ls/python-ls/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Windows+tests%22) [![image](https://img.shields.io/github/license/python-ls/python-ls.svg)](https://github.com/python-ls/python-ls/blob/master/LICENSE)

A Python 3.6+ implementation of the [Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol).

## Installation

The base language server requires [Jedi](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi) to provide Completions, Definitions, Hover, References, Signature Help, and Symbols:

```
pip install python-lsp-server
```

If the respective dependencies are found, the following optional providers will be enabled:
- [Rope](https://github.com/python-rope/rope) for Completions and renaming
- [Pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes) linter to detect various errors
- [McCabe](https://github.com/PyCQA/mccabe) linter for complexity checking
- [pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle) linter for style checking
- [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle) linter for docstring style checking (disabled by default)
- [autopep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8) for code formatting
- [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf) for code formatting (preferred over autopep8)

Optional providers can be installed using the `extras` syntax. To install [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf) formatting for example:

```
pip install 'python-lsp-server[yapf]'
```

All optional providers can be installed using:

```
pip install 'python-lsp-server[all]'
```

If you get an error similar to `'install_requires' must be a string or list of strings` then please upgrade setuptools before trying again.

```
pip install -U setuptools
```

### 3rd Party Plugins

Installing these plugins will add extra functionality to the language server:

- [pyls-flake8](https://github.com/emanspeaks/pyls-flake8/): Error checking using [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/).
- [pylsp-mypy](https://github.com/Richardk2n/pylsp-mypy): [MyPy](http://mypy-lang.org/) type checking for Python >=3.6.
- [pyls-isort](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/pyls-isort): code formatting using [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) (automatic import sorting).
- [python-lsp-black](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-black): code formatting using [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).
- [pyls-memestra](https://github.com/QuantStack/pyls-memestra): detecting the use of deprecated APIs.
- [pylsp-rope](https://github.com/python-rope/pylsp-rope): Extended refactoring capabilities using [Rope](https://github.com/python-rope/rope).

Please see the above repositories for examples on how to write plugins for the Python LSP Server.

[cookiecutter-pylsp-plugin](https://github.com/python-lsp/cookiecutter-pylsp-plugin) is a [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/) template for setting up a basic plugin project for python-lsp-server. It documents all the essentials you need to know to kick start your own plugin project.

Please file an issue if you require assistance writing a plugin.

## Configuration

Configuration is loaded from zero or more configuration sources.  Currently implemented are:

- pycodestyle: discovered in `~/.config/pycodestyle`, `setup.cfg`, `tox.ini` and `pycodestyle.cfg`.
- flake8: discovered in `~/.config/flake8`, `setup.cfg`, `tox.ini` and `flake8.cfg`

The default configuration source is pycodestyle. Change the `pylsp.configurationSources` setting to `['flake8']` in order to respect flake8 configuration instead.

Overall configuration is computed first from user configuration (in home directory), overridden by configuration passed in by the language client, and then overridden by configuration discovered in the workspace.

To enable pydocstyle for linting docstrings add the following setting in your LSP configuration:
`"pylsp.plugins.pydocstyle.enabled": true`

All configuration options are described in [`CONFIGURATION.md`](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server/blob/develop/CONFIGURATION.md).

## LSP Server Features

* Auto Completion
* Code Linting
* Signature Help
* Go to definition
* Hover
* Find References
* Document Symbols
* Document Formatting
* Code folding
* Multiple workspaces

## Development

To run the test suite:

```sh
pip install '.[test]' && pytest
```

After adding configuration options to `schema.json`, refresh the `CONFIGURATION.md` file with

```
python scripts/jsonschema2md.py pylsp/config/schema.json CONFIGURATION.md
```

# Spyder Logo Guidelines
These guidelines are meant to help keep the Spyder logo consistent and recognizable across all its uses. 
They also provide a common language for referring to the logos and their components.

The primary logo is the horizontal option (logomark and text next to each other).
You may also use the logomark on its own (meaning the logomark without text). 
When in doubt, it’s preferable to use the primary logo that includes text over the logomark alone. 

If you have a case where you do not know what background the logo will be on or it is a variable background (such as the application icon on a desktop), it is best to use a logo option with the light grey background.

## Color
Colors used in the various logos are as follows:
- Full color options are a combination of red (`#8c0000` or `rgb(140, 0, 0)`) and grey (`#303030` or `rgb(48,48,48)`).
- Full color options with a background have the same red and grey as other full color options and add a light grey (`#fafafa` or `rgb(250, 250, 250)`) rectangle behind it.
- Light options are white (`#ffffff` or `rgb(255, 255, 255)`). 
- Dark options are black (`#000000` or `rgb(0, 0, 0)`).

Whenever possible, use the full color logos. One color logos (light or dark) are to be used when full color will not have enough contrast or cannot be produced.

## Minimum Size
Please do not make the primary logo smaller than 75 px wide or the logomark smaller than 14 px wide.

## Logo Integrity
A few other notes to keep in mind when using the logo:
- Be sure to scale the logo proportionally.
- Maintain a good amount of space around the logo. Don’t let it overlap with text, images, or other elements without giving it a single color background.
- Do not try and recreate or modify the logo. For example, do not use the logomark and then try to write Spyder in another font.*Italic*

      git checkout -b feature-xyz

-  Hands on

   For tips on working with the code, see the Code Guide.

-  Test, test, test

   Testing is best done through ``tox``, which provides a number of
   targets and allows testing against multiple different Python
   environments:

-  Add you and your changes

   Please add a list item to `CHANGES <./CHANGES.rst>`__ if the fix or
   feature is not trivial (small doc updates, typo fixes). Please add
   you as an author to `AUTHORS <./AUTHORS.rst>`__.

-  Add files to commit

   Add files that are part of your changes, remember that each commit
   must represent a small but functional change. Remember to add
   CHANGES.rst and AUTHORS.rst too. To add all files changed do:

   .. code:: bash

      git add .

-  Committing changes.

   GitHub recognizes certain phrases that can be used to automatically
   update the issue tracker, so you can commit like this:

   .. code:: bash

      git commit -m "Add useful new feature that does this, close #42"

      git commit -m "Fix returning problem for get_style(), fix #78"

-  Push changes in the branch to your forked repository on GitHub.

   .. code:: bash

      git push origin feature-xyz

-  Submit a pull request (PR).

   Do it from your branch to the respective branch using the `GitHub
   PR <https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QDarkStyleSheet/pulls>`__
   interface.

-  Wait for a maintainer to review your changes.

Logging
-------

Inside modules we provided a logging that should be used to inform the
user. Please, follow the levels bellow.

-  debug: for debug information, high detailed one, directed to
   programmers;

-  info: something important for common user to know;

-  warning: something that should not be a big problem or a decision
   changed;

-  error: some error, but not capable of stop program;

-  critical: something that could stop the running program.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is the key to keep all information and necessary
instructions to others. We use the reStructured text format (rst) for
all docs.

All new functions, classes, files, must be documented with all
arguments, returns, exceptions. Without this it should not pass the
tests.

The better example is to see the current files to get the style. We are
using the Google Format and Sphinx for generating the docs.

Guide to QDarkStyle
-------------------

Structure of the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now you can use our example to work on the stylesheet. It has all
possible widget provided by Qt - common ones. Feel free to add more to
them.

To simplify the structure, there are separated files in
`qdarkstyle/example/ui <https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QDarkStyleSheet/tree/master/qdarkstyle/example/ui>`__
folder.

-  ``dw_buttons.ui``: all types of buttons;
-  ``dw_containers_no_tabs.ui``: all types of containers except for
   tabs;
-  ``dw_containers_tabs.ui``: all containers tabs;
-  ``dw_displays.ui``: all types of displays;
-  ``dw_inputs_fields.ui``: all types of inputs with fields;
-  ``dw_inputs_no_fields.ui``: all types of inputs without fields;
-  ``dw_views.ui``: all types of views;
-  ``dw_widgets.ui``: all types of widgets;
-  ``mw_menus.ui``: main window with all menus and toolbars.

*Note*: ``dw`` stands for dock widget and ``mw`` for main window.

The entire example is built at runtime, in
`qdarkstyle.example <https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QDarkStyleSheet/blob/master/qdarkstyle/example/__main__.py>`__.
To see more information about it, see its reference.

Feel free to modify UI files with Qt Designer.

Modifying QSS File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are changing the
`stylesheet <https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QDarkStyleSheet/blob/master/qdarkstyle/qss/_styles.scss>`__,
you will need to recompile the QRC files using
`qdarkstyle.utils <https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QDarkStyleSheet/blob/master/qdarkstyle/utils/__main__.py>`__.

This generates all resources files (images), ``style.qrc``,
``_variables.scss``, ``style.qss``, and finally ``style_rc.py``
for each palette.

Making It Easy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To simplify this process for the developer, if you are changing many
things, use the script
`run\_ui\_css\_edition.py <https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QDarkStyleSheet/blob/master/script/run_ui_css_edition.py>`__:

.. code:: bash

   python scripts/run_ui_css_edition.py

This creates a loop that restarts the application, process ui and css
files.

For more information about those scripts, see their documentation.

Qt, Stylesheets, Palettes and Icons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `Box model <http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/images/stylesheet-boxmodel.png>`__
-  `Box model with height and
   width <https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/lib/images/css-box-model.jpg>`__
-  `Customizing
   Widgets <http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet-customizing.html>`__
-  `Window
   structure <http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/images/mainwindowlayout.png>`__
-  `QMainWindow <http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmainwindow.html>`__
-  `References <http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet.html>`__

Create good palettes with these tools. For example, on paletton, choose
three colors from grayish light (foreground), grayish dark (background)
and three more colorful colors (selection). Grayish colors have a little
bit of the main color, so it is nice to change it if you change the main
color.

-  `Paletton.com <http://paletton.com/>`__
-  `Coolors.co <https://coolors.co/>`__

As a minimal guide to create new icons (svg) images, we list two main
sources.

-  `Material <https://material.io/design/iconography/product-icons.html#grid-keyline-shapes>`__
-  `KDE <https://hig.kde.org/style/icon.html>`__

Main characteristics of SVG images are:

-  Base size: 32px X 32px;
-  Border: 2px space, except continuous lines;
-  Corners and line end's: rounded;
-  Line: 2px minimum thickness. Complementary thickness using multiples
   of 2px;
-  Spacing: 4px when needed;
-  Color: #ff0000, red for all images - programmatically changed;
-  Keep only structural changes in images, not colors, e.g, states hover
   and disabled;
-  Lines and shapes should align with the grid centralized;
-  Names: from basic form to specific, so they keep grouped. Ex.:
   arrow\_left, arrow\_up.

Some example are given below for the horizontal Handle, Minimize, and
checked Checkbox.

.. raw:: html

   <table style="width:100%">

.. raw:: html

   <tr>

::

    <th colspan=3>Examples of icons</th>

    <td><img src="./images/icon_minimize.png"/></td>
    <td><img src="./images/move.png"/></td>

.. raw:: html

   </tr>

.. raw:: html

   </table>

Unit Testing and Fix Preview
----------------------------

It is a good practice, if you are writing functions to QDarkStyle or
fixing something related to those functions (not style), that you
provide a test for it.

If you are fixing something about style, please, at least, provide an
screenshot before and after the fix to comparison. This could be
inserted in the issue tracker, as a message. Better than that, use
modules provided in test folder to create a GUI test, creating a new
file for it.

Check `test <./test>`__ files to more details. Tests will keep our
application stable.

If You Are a Maintainer, Go Ahead to Production
----------------------------------------------

Of course, until you start these steps, make sure the package have
passed all tests and checkers before continue. You must have accounts to
both test and official PyPI website below along with be inserted as a
maintainer in both.

1. Install ``twine``

   ``pip install twine``

2. Generate a distribution (code package and wheel)

   ``python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel``

3. Check with ``twine``, which also tests README format for PyPI

   ``twine check dist/*``

4. Try upload in `PyPI test
   page <https://test.pypi.org/project/QDarkStyle>`__ platform before
   the oficial

   ``twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*``

5. Try to install from test

   ``pip install --no-deps --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ qdarkstyle``

6. Then, remove it

   ``pip uninstall qdarkstyle -y``

7. Upload to `PyPI official
   page <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/QDarkStyle>`__

   ``twine upload --repository-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*``

8. Try to install from oficial

   ``pip install qdarkstyle``

You can also use the tox environment to produce the release and upload
the distribution.

QDarkStyleSheet
===============

|Build Status| |Docs Status| |Latest PyPI version| |License: MIT|
|License: CC BY 4.0| |Conduct|

The most complete dark/light style sheet for Qt applications (Qt4*, Qt5,
PySide*, PySide2, PyQt4*, PyQt5, QtPy, PyQtGraph, Qt.Py) for Python
2*/3 and C++.

`Check out the complete documentation. <https://qdarkstylesheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/screenshots.html>`__


What is new?
------------


Version 3
~~~~~~~~~

In the current version 3, `qdarkstyle` is now working as a theme framework,
currently for dark/light themes, keeping styled widgets identical throughout
theme colors.

The palette has been redefined and improved (UI/UX) to accept more colors
and to be able to implement new themes thanks to the
`Spyder team <https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder>`__ collaboration.

The current stable version is using Python 3 (preferable 3.6+) and Qt5
(PyQt5 and PySide 2).

We still preparing the portability to Qt6 since we need changes in
`QtPy <https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtpy>`__ dependency project.

[*] Python 2, as well as Qt4 (PyQt4 and PySide), will not be supported anymore.
They still there as it is, but no back-compatibility, fixes, nor features
will be implemented.

Version 2
~~~~~~~~~

We moved to QtPy to simplify your code in v2.8, thus this is a required
dependency now. We included special patches in three main categories:
operating system, Qt/binding version, application.

Included in that, lots of widgets' styles were included/fixed. A Qt
application example (Python only) with almost all types of widgets and
combinations were included to serve as a portfolio and a checklist for
new styles.

We have added SCSS in v2.7, so the palette can be accessed programmatically.
Also, many scripts were added to give freedom to developers who want to
change the colors of our palette. All images and icons were revised, also
creating SVG files for all of them.

In version 2.6 and later, a restructure stylesheet is provided. The
palette has only 9 colors. Most widgets are revised and their styles
were improved. We also provide a command line (script) to get info that
could be used when opening issues. See the image below.


Version 1
~~~~~~~~~

First stable release of QDarkStyle.

    -  **qdarkstyle/theme/style.qss**
    -  **qdarkstyle/theme/style.qrc**
    -  **qdarkstyle/theme/rc/** (the whole directory)


-  Add **qdarkstyle/theme/style.qrc** to your **.pro file** as follows:

    .. code:: c++

        RESOURCES += qdarkstyle/theme/style.qrc


-  Load the stylesheet:

    .. code:: c++

        QFile f(":qdarkstyle/theme/style.qss");

        if (!f.exists())   {
            printf("Unable to set stylesheet, file not found\n");
        }
        else   {
            f.open(QFile::ReadOnly | QFile::Text);
            QTextStream ts(&f);
            qApp->setStyleSheet(ts.readAll());
        }


Note: The ":" in the file name is necessary to define that file as a
resource library. For more information see the discussion
`here <https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QDarkStyleSheet/pull/87>`__.


Usage in applications
---------------------


If your project already uses QtPy or you need to set it programmatically,
it is far more simple

.. code:: python

    import sys
    import qdarkstyle
    import os

    # set the environment variable to use a specific wrapper
    # it can be set to pyqt, pyqt5, pyside or pyside2 (not implemented yet)
    # you do not need to use QtPy to set this variable
    os.environ['QT_API'] = 'pyqt5'

    # import from QtPy instead of doing it directly
    # note that QtPy always uses PyQt5 API
    from qtpy import QtWidgets

    # create the application and the main window
    app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = QtWidgets.QMainWindow()

    # setup stylesheet
    # the default system in qdarkstyle uses qtpy environment variable
    app.setStyleSheet(qdarkstyle.load_stylesheet())

    # run
    window.show()
    app.exec_()


If you are using PyQt5 directly, see the complete example

.. code:: python

    import sys
    import qdarkstyle
    from PyQt5 import QtWidgets

    # create the application and the main window
    app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = QtWidgets.QMainWindow()

    # setup stylesheet
    app.setStyleSheet(qdarkstyle.load_stylesheet_pyqt5())
    # or in new API
    app.setStyleSheet(qdarkstyle.load_stylesheet(qt_api='pyqt5'))

    # run
    window.show()
    app.exec_()


Here is an example using PySide2

.. code:: python

    import sys
    import qdarkstyle
    from PySide2 import QtWidgets

    # create the application and the main window
    app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = QtWidgets.QMainWindow()

    # setup stylesheet
    app.setStyleSheet(qdarkstyle.load_stylesheet_pyside2())
    # or in new API
    app.setStyleSheet(qdarkstyle.load_stylesheet(qt_api='pyside2'))

    # run
    window.show()
    app.exec_()


If you use PyQtGraph, then the code is

.. code:: python

    import sys
    import qdarkstyle
    import os

    # set the environment variable to use a specific wrapper
    # it can be set to PyQt, PyQt5, PySide or PySide2 (not implemented yet)
    os.environ['PYQTGRAPH_QT_LIB'] = 'PyQt5'

    # import from pyqtgraph instead of doing it directly
    # note that PyQtGraph always uses PyQt4 API
    from pyqtgraph.Qt import QtGui

    # create the application and the main window
    app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = QtGui.QMainWindow()

    # setup stylesheet
    app.setStyleSheet(qdarkstyle.load_stylesheet(qt_api=os.environ['PYQTGRAPH_QT_LIB'])

    # run
    window.show()
    app.exec_()

If you are using Qt.py, which is different from qtpy, you should install
qtpy then set both to the same binding.


Usage of example/portfolio
--------------------------


There is an example included in the package. You only need to have PySide2 or
PyQt5 installed on your system.

.. code:: bash

    # dark theme example
    $ qdarkstyle.example --palette=dark

    # light theme example
    $ qdarkstyle.example --palette=light

    # no theme/style sheet applied
    $ qdarkstyle.example --palette=none

    # check all options included
    $ qdarkstyle.example --help

Known Issues
============

Dialog style
------------

Dialogs, e.g. file dialogs, could appear not styled since it inherits from OS
theme/style as described in the issue
`#172 <https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QDarkStyleSheet/issues/172>`__.
There are some options that can be exploited there.


System icons
------------

Similar to the Dialogs, default icons are inherited from OS but we
are planning to create our own set of icons to provide a more uniform UI. See
`#192 <https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QDarkStyleSheet/issues/192>`__.
Colors
======

Color System
------------

The color system is the source of the colors that themes draw from. Each
has a range of values from ``0`` (black ``#000000``) to ``150`` (white
``#ffffff``). Not all colors are or should be used in every theme, but
the scales provide a chance to see the colors in a larger context and
makes it easy to switch out colors as desired.

The number assigned to each estimates how light or dark that color is.
For parts of an interface that are interactive, have text, or have any
other important information, please use colors combinations that have at
least a difference of 20 where colors overlap. Depending on the colors,
you may need more contrast to create a theme that meets accessibility
standards about contrast or color blindness.

#####################################################
Spyder: The Scientific Python Development Environment
#####################################################

*Spyder* is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for scientific computing, written in and for the Python programming language.
It comes with an :guilabel:`Editor` to write code, a :guilabel:`Console` to evaluate it and view the results at any time, a :guilabel:`Variable Explorer` to examine the variables defined during evaluation, and several other facilities to help you effectively develop the programs you need as a scientist.


This tutorial was originally authored by `Hans Fangohr <https://fangohr.github.io/>`__ from the University of Southampton (UK), and subsequently updated for Spyder 3.3.x by the development team (see `Historical note`_ for more details).



=======================
First steps with Spyder
=======================

This section is aimed at Python and Spyder beginners.
If you find it too simple, please continue to the `next one <python-beginners-ref_>`__.


Execute a given program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are going to run this program as a first example:

.. code-block:: python

    # Demo file for Spyder Tutorial
    # Hans Fangohr, University of Southampton, UK

    def hello():
        """Print "Hello World" and return None."""
        print("Hello World")

    # Main program starts here
    hello()

#. Please create a new file in the Spyder :guilabel:`Editor` pane (with :menuselection:`File --> New file`, or :kbd:`Ctrl-N`/ :kbd:`Command-N`).
   Then copy and paste the code inside the box above into the file, and save it with the name :file:`hello.py`.

#. To execute the program, select :menuselection:`Run --> Run` from the menu (or press :kbd:`F5`), and confirm the ``Run settings`` if required.

#. If this is your first time running something, you should see an output like this:

   .. code-block:: python

        In [1]: runfile('/File/Path/hello.py', wdir=r'/File/Path')
        Hello World

        In [2]:

If so, then you have just run your first Python program -- well done.

.. note::

   The particular paths shown inside ``runfile()`` will depend on where you have saved the file, but this is inserted by Spyder automatically.


What happens when you execute a program?
----------------------------------------

#. Python reads the file line by line, ignoring comments (*i.e.* lines starting with the ``#`` symbol).

#. When it comes across the ``def`` keyword, it knows that a function is DEFined in this and the next (one or more) lines.
   All *indented* lines following ``def hello():`` belong to the function body.

   Note that the function object is created at this point in the file, but the function is not yet called (*i.e.* not executed).

#. When the Python interpreter encounters commands (other than ``def ...`` and a few other keywords) that are written in the left-most column, it will execute these immediately.

#. In the :file:`hello.py` file this is only the line reading ``hello()`` which will actually call (*i.e.* *execute*) the function with name ``hello``.

   If you comment or remove the line ``hello()`` from the program and run the whole file again (by pressing :kbd:`F5`, or selecting :menuselection:`Run --> Run`), nothing will be printed (because the function ``hello`` is defined but not called, *i.e.* not executed).

Now you should know how to execute a Python program that you have in the :guilabel:`Editor` pane in Spyder using the :guilabel:`IPython Console`.

If you are just starting to learn Python, this is probably a good point to return to your text book/course and look at further basic examples.

The next section gives more detailed information how you can execute *parts* of your code from the :guilabel:`Editor` in the :guilabel:`IPython Console`.
This is a more advanced technique but can be very useful.
You may also be interested in the option to execute "cells", `chunks of code that are separated by delimiters <cell-shortcut-ref_>`__.


Call existing functions in the Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _call-functions-console-ref:

Once you have executed the :file:`hello.py` program, the function object ``hello`` is defined and known to the :guilabel:`IPython Console`.
We can thus call the function from the :guilabel:`Console`.

Type ``hello()`` in the :guilabel:`Console` (next to ``In [?]`` prompt, where ``?`` is a count of the number of times you've executed something), and press the :kbd:`Enter` key.

You should find that the ``hello()`` function is executed again, *i.e.* printing ``Hello World`` a second time.
Your function call at the :guilabel:`Console` together with the output should look like this:

.. code-block:: python

    In [ ]: hello()
    Hello World

Can you see how this differs from executing the whole program again?

When we execute the whole program (by pressing :kbd:`F5`), Python goes through the file, creates the ``hello`` function object (overriding the previous object), reaches the ``hello()`` line and calls the function.

When we call ``hello()`` in the :guilabel:`Console`, we only call the function object ``hello`` that has been defined in the :guilabel:`IPython Console` when we executed the whole :file:`hello.py` file earlier (by pressing :kbd:`F5`).

This will become clearer over time, as we work with larger examples.
You may want to return to this tutorial at a slightly later stage.


Inspecting objects defined in the Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python provides a function that displays all known objects in the current namespace of the :guilabel:`Console`, called ``dir``.
Type ``dir()`` at the prompt, and ignore everything starting with an underscore (``_``) for now.
Can you see ``hello`` in the list?

.. note::

   If you get a long list of defined objects, then Spyder may have done some convenience imports for you already.
   To address this you may want to `reset the namespace <reset-namespace-ref_>`_, execute :file:`hello.py` again by pressing :kbd:`F5`, then run ``dir()`` as suggested above.

Once an object is visible in the current namespace (as is ``hello`` in this example), we can use the ``help`` function as follows to learn about it.
Typing ``help(hello)`` at the :guilabel:`Console` prompt, you should see an output like this:

.. code-block:: python

    In [ ]: help(hello)
    Help on function hello in module __main__:

    hello()
        Print "Hello World" and return None.

Where does Python get that information from?
Some of it (like the number of input arguments and names of those variables; here we have none) Python can find through inspecting its objects.
Additional information comes from the documentation string provided for the function object ``hello``.
The documentation string, or *docstring*, is the first string immediately below the line ``def hello():``.
By convention, and as they usually extend over multiple lines, they are enclosed by triple double quotes (``"""``).

The Spyder environment also provides a :guilabel:`Help` pane which by default is located in the top right corner.

While the cursor is on the name of an object, press :kbd:`Ctrl-I` (or :kbd:`Command-I` on macOS), and you should find that the same information as we obtained from ``help(hello)`` is provided automatically in the :guilabel:`Help` pane:

.. image:: images/spyder-hello-docstring.png
   :align: center

This works in the :guilabel:`Console` and in the :guilabel:`Editor`.


Updating objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's say you wanted to change how an existing function behaves -- how should you get Python to recognize your changes?


Simple strategy: Re-execute whole program
-----------------------------------------

#. In the :guilabel:`Editor` window, change the function ``hello`` so that it prints ``Good Bye World`` rather than ``Hello World``.

#. Press :kbd:`F5` (to execute the whole program)

#. Check that the output of the program is now:

   .. code-block:: python

        Good Bye World

What has happened when you pressed :kbd:`F5` is this: Python has gone through the :file:`hello.py` file and created a new function object ``hello`` (overriding the function object ``hello`` we had defined before) and then executed the function.


Looking at the details
----------------------

We'll now investigate this behavior in a little more depth:

#. We need to start with a clearly defined state.
   To do this, please change the function ``hello()`` back so that it prints ``Hello World``, then press :kbd:`F5` to run the whole program and check that it prints ``Hello World``.

#. Call the function ``hello()`` from the command prompt (as described `previously <call-functions-console-ref_>`__).
   You should see ``Hello World`` printed.

#. Now change the function definition so that it would print ``Later World``, and save the file (but do NOT execute the program, *i.e.* do NOT press :kbd:`F5` yet).

#. Call the function ``hello()`` in the :guilabel:`Console` again.
   You should find that the text printed reads ``Hello World``, like here:

   .. code-block:: python

        In [ ]: hello()
        Hello World

Why is this so?
Because the ``hello`` function object in the :guilabel:`Console` is the old one which prints ``Hello World``.
So far, we have changed the file :file:`hello.py` (and replaced ``Hello World`` in there with ``Later World``) in the :guilabel:`Editor` but this has not affected the objects that have previously been created in the :guilabel:`Console`.

To update the console's namespace with modified function, we have two options:

* Option 1: Execute the whole file :file:`hello.py` again by pressing :kbd:`F5`: this creates a new function object ``hello`` (and overrides the old one).
  You should find that if you press :kbd:`F5`, and then call ``hello()`` at the prompt, the new text ``Later World`` is printed.

* Option 2: Select the region you have changed (in this case the whole function ``hello``, starting from the line ``def hello():`` down to ``print("Later World")``, then click :menuselection:`Run --> Run selection or current line` or press :kbd:`F9`.

  This will update the ``hello`` object in the :guilabel:`Console` without having to execute the whole :file:`hello.py` file:

  .. code-block:: python

        In [ ]: def hello():
           ...:     """Print "Hello World" and return None."""
           ...:     print("Later world")
           ...:

  If we now type ``hello()``, we see the updated response:

  .. code-block:: python

        In [ ]: hello()
        Later world

The ability to execute *parts of the code* to update some objects in the :guilabel:`Console` (in the example above, we updated the function object ``hello``), is of great use when developing and debugging more complex programs, and when re-creating objects/data in the :guilabel:`Console` session takes time.
For example, by modifying only the functions (or classes/objects, etc). that we are actually developing or debugging, we can keep re-using the data and other objects created previously.



============================================
Recommended first steps for Python beginners
============================================

.. _python-beginners-ref:

Before we begin, make sure to have an :guilabel:`IPython Console` open (bottom-right by default).
This uses the `IPython <https://ipython.org>`__ interpreter, standard in the scientific community.
To open a new :guilabel:`Console` at any time, select :menuselection:`Consoles --> Open an IPython Console`.


Reset the namespace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _reset-namespace-ref:

The `namespace <https://bytebaker.com/2008/07/30/python-namespaces/>`__ (*i.e.* the collection of objects defined in the :guilabel:`Console` at any given time) can be cleared in IPython using the ``%reset`` command.
Type ``%reset`` and press :kbd:`Enter`, then confirm with ``y``:

.. code-block:: none

    In [1]: %reset

    Once deleted, variables cannot be recovered. Proceed (y/[n])? y

    In [2]:

You can also accomplish the same thing by selecting ``Remove all variables`` from the "Gear" option menu in the top right of the :guilabel:`IPython Console` pane.
We discuss this a little further, but you can skip the following if you are not interested.

After issuing the ``%reset`` command or selecting ``Remove all variables``, we should only have a few objects defined in the namespace of that session.
We can list all of them using the ``dir()`` command:

.. code-block:: python

    In [2]: dir()
    Out[2]:
    ['In',
    'Out',
    '__builtin__',
    '__builtins__',
    '__name__',
    '_dh',
    '_i',
    '_i2',
    '_ih',
    '_ii',
    '_iii',
    '_oh',
    '_sh',
    'exit',
    'get_ipython',
    'quit']

Finally, if you like to skip the confirmation step of the ``reset`` command, you can use ``%reset -f`` instead of ``%reset``; or, tick the ``Don't show again`` checkbox in the ``Remove all variables`` dialog.


Strive for PEP8 Compliance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the syntax that is enforced by the Python programming language, there are additional conventions regarding the layout of the source code, in particular the `Style Guide for Python source code <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__ known as "PEP 8".
By following this guide and writing code in the same style as almost all Python programmers do, it becomes easier to read, and thus easier to debug and re-use -- both for the original author and others.

To have Spyder check this for you automatically, see the `next section <pep8-enable-ref_>`__.



====================
Selected preferences
====================

Where are the preferences?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A lot of Spyder's behaviour can be configured through its Preferences.
Where this is located in the menu depends on your operating system:

* On Windows and Linux, go to :menuselection:`Tools --> Preferences`

* On macOS, navigate to :menuselection:`Python/Spyder --> Preferences`


Warn if PEP 8 code style guidelines are violated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _pep8-enable-ref:

Go to :menuselection:`Tools --> Preferences --> Completion and Linting --> Cody Style` and tick the checkbox next to ``Real-time code style analysis``.


Automatic Symbolic Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Through :menuselection:`Preferences --> IPython console --> Advanced Settings --> Use symbolic math` we can activate the console's SYMbolic PYthon (sympy) mode that is provided by the `SymPy <https://www.sympy.org/>`_ Python package.
This allows nicely rendered mathematical output (LaTeX style), imports some SymPy objects automatically when the :guilabel:`IPython Console` starts, and reports what it has done.
You'll need to have SymPy installed for it to work, and a LaTeX distribution on your system to see the formatted output (see the `Getting LaTeX <https://www.latex-project.org/get/>`__ page on the LaTeX site to acquire the latter, if you don't already have it).

.. code-block:: python

    These commands were executed:
    >>> from __future__ import division
    >>> from sympy import *
    >>> x, y, z, t = symbols('x y z t')
    >>> k, m, n = symbols('k m n', integer=True)
    >>> f, g, h = symbols('f g h', cls=Function)

We can now use the variables ``x`` and ``y``, for example like this:

.. image:: images/spyder-sympy-example.png
     :align: center



==============================
Shortcuts for useful functions
==============================

.. note::

   The following are the default shortcuts; however, those marked with ``*`` can be customized through the Keyboard shortcuts tab in the Preferences.
   Also, macOS users should substitute ``Command`` for ``Ctrl``, and ``Option`` for ``Alt``.

* :kbd:`F5`\* executes the current file.

* :kbd:`F9`\* executes the currently highlighted chunk of code; this is very useful to (say) update definitions of functions in the :guilabel:`Console` session without having to run the whole file again.
  If nothing is selected, :kbd:`F9`\* executes the current line.

* :kbd:`Tab`\* auto-completes commands, function names, variable names, and methods in the :guilabel:`Console` and the :guilabel:`Editor`.
  This feature is very useful, and should be employed routinely.
  Do try it now if auto-completion is new to you.
  Assume you have defined a variable::

    mylongvariablename = 42

  Suppose we need to write code that computes ``mylongvariablename + 100``.
  We can simply type ``my`` and then press the :kbd:`Tab` key.
  The full variable name will be completed and inserted at the cursor position if the name is unique, and then we can carry on and type `` + 100``.
  If the name is not uniquely identifiable given the letters ``my``, a list field will be displayed from which the desired variable can be chosen.
  Choosing from the list can be done with the :kbd:`Up` and :kbd:`Down` keys with the :kbd:`Enter` key to select, or by typing more letters of the name in question (the selection will update automatically) and confirming by pressing :kbd:`Enter` when the appropriate name is identified.

.. _cell-shortcut-ref:

* :kbd:`Ctrl-Enter`\* executes the current cell (menu entry :menuselection:`Run --> Run cell`).
  A cell is defined as the code between two lines which start with the characters ``#%%``, ``# %%`` or ``# <codecell>``.

* :kbd:`Shift-Enter`\* executes the current cell and advances the cursor to the next cell (menu entry :menuselection:`Run --> Run cell and advance`).

  Cells are useful for breaking large files or long blocks of code into more manageable chunks. Like those in an IPython notebook, each cell can be run independently.

* :kbd:`Alt-Up`\* moves the current line up.
  If multiple lines are highlighted, they are moved up together.
  :kbd:`Alt-Down`\* works correspondingly, moving line(s) down.

* :kbd:`Ctrl-LeftMouseButton` or :kbd:`Alt-G`\* on a function/method in the :guilabel:`Editor` opens a new :guilabel:`Editor` tab showing the definition of that function.

* :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-Alt-M`\* maximizes the current window (or changes the size back to normal if pressed in a maximized window).

* :kbd:`Ctrl-Shift-F`\* activates the Find in Files pane, allowing ``grep``-like searches across all files in a specified scope.

* :kbd:`Ctrl - =` will increase the font size in the :guilabel:`Editor` or the :guilabel:`Console`, whereas :kbd:`Ctrl - -` will decrease it.

  The font face and size for other parts of the UI can be set under :menuselection:`Preferences --> General --> Appearance --> Fonts`.

* :kbd:`Ctrl-S`\* *in the* :guilabel:`Editor` saves the file currently being edited.
  This also forces various warning triangles in the left column of the :guilabel:`Editor` to be updated (otherwise they update every 2.5 seconds by default, which is also configurable).

.. _save-shortcut-console-ref:

* :kbd:`Ctrl-S`\* *in the* :guilabel:`Console` saves the current IPython session as an HTML file, including any figures that may be displayed inline.
  This is useful as a quick way of recording what has been done in a session.

  (It is not currently possible to load this saved record back into the session -- if you need functionality like this, look for the IPython Notebook).

* :kbd:`Ctrl-I`\* when pressed while the cursor is on an object opens documentation for that object in the help pane.



=================
Run configuration
=================

These are the settings that define how the file in the :guilabel:`Editor` is executed if we select :menuselection:`Run --> Run` or press :kbd:`F5`.

By default, the settings box will appear the first time we try to run a file.
If we want to change the settings at any other time, they can be found under :menuselection:`Run --> Configure` or by pressing :kbd:`F6`.

There are three choices for the :guilabel:`Console` to use, of which I'll discuss the first two.
Let's assume we have a program :file:`hello.py` in the :guilabel:`Editor` which reads

.. code-block:: python

    def hello(name):
        """Given an object 'name', print 'Hello ' and the object."""
        print("Hello {}".format(name))


    i = 42
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        hello(i)


Execute in current console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the default option, and generally a good choice.


Persistence of objects after code execution
-------------------------------------------

Choosing the ``Execute in current console`` setting under :menuselection:`Run --> Configure` means that:

* When the execution of :file:`hello.py` is completed, we can interact with the :guilabel:`Console` in which the program ran.

* In particular, we can inspect and interact with objects that the execution of our program created, such as ``i`` and ``hello()``.

This is generally very useful for incremental coding, testing and debugging.
For example, we can call ``hello()`` directly from the :guilabel:`Console` prompt, and don't need to execute the whole :file:`hello.py` for this (although if we change the function ``hello()``, we need to execute the file, or at least the function definition, to make the new version of ``hello()`` visible at the :guilabel:`Console`; either by re-executing the whole script or via :menuselection:`Run --> Run Selection`).


Persistence of objects from before code execution
-------------------------------------------------

However, executing the code in the :guilabel:`Editor` in the current :guilabel:`Console` also entails a third effect:

* The code that executes can see other (global) objects that were defined in the :guilabel:`Console` session.

*This* persistence of objects is easily forgotten and usually not required when working on small programs (although it can be of great value occasionally).
These objects could come from previous execution of code, from interactive work in the :guilabel:`Console`, or from convenience imports such as ``from sympy import *`` (Spyder may do some of those convenience imports automatically).

This visibility of objects in the :guilabel:`Console` namespace to the code we execute may also result in coding mistakes if the code inadvertently relies on these objects.

Here is an example: Imagine that:

#. We run the code :file:`hello.py`.
   Subsequently, the variable ``i`` is known in the :guilabel:`Console` as a global variable.

#. We edit the :file:`hello.py` source and accidentally delete the line ``i = 42``.

#. We execute the file containing :file:`hello.py` again.
   At this point, the call of ``hello(i)`` will *not* fail because the :guilabel:`Console` has an object of name ``i`` defined, although this is not defined in the source of :file:`hello.py`.

At this point, we could save :file:`hello.py` and (falsely) think it would execute correctly.
However, running it in a new :guilabel:`IPython Console` session (or via ``python hello.py`` in a system shell, say) would result in an error, because ``i`` is not defined.

The problem arises because the code makes use of an object (here ``i``) without creating it first.
This also affects importing of modules: if we had imported ``sympy`` at the IPython prompt, then our program will see that when executed in this :guilabel:`IPython Console` session.

To learn how we can double check that our code does not depend on such existing objects, see `below <check-code-independent-ref_>`_ .


Execute in a dedicated console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Choosing ``Execute in a dedicated console`` under :menuselection:`Run --> Configure` will start *a new* :guilabel:`IPython Console` *every time* the :file:`hello.py` program is executed.
The major advantage of this mode over `Execute in current console`_ is that we can be certain that there are no global objects defined in this :guilabel:`Console` which originate from debugging and repeated execution of our code.
Every time we run the code in the :guilabel:`Editor`, the :guilabel:`IPython Console` in which the code runs is restarted.

This is a safe option, but provides less flexibility in interactive execution.


How to double check your code executes correctly "on its own"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _check-code-independent-ref:

Assuming you have selected the `Execute in current console`_ option, you have two methods to check that your code works on its own (*i.e.* it does not depend on undefined variables, unimported modules and commands etc):

* Switch from `Execute in current console`_ to `Execute in a dedicated console`_, and run the code from the :guilabel:`Editor`.

  Alternatively, if you want to stay with the current :guilabel:`Console`, you can

* First `reset the namespace <reset-namespace-ref_>`_ with IPython's magic ``%reset`` command or the ``Remove all variables`` menu option, which will clear all objects, such as ``i`` in the example above from the current namespace.
  Then, execute the code from the :guilabel:`Editor`.


Recommendation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My recommendation for beginners would be to `Execute in current console`_.

Once you have completed a piece of code, double check that it executes independently using one of the options explained `above <check-code-independent-ref_>`_.



==================
Other observations
==================

Multiple files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When multiple files are opened in the :guilabel:`Editor`, the corresponding tabs at the top of the window area are arranged in the order they are opened, but can be easily moved around if you wish.

On the left of the tabs, there is as icon that shows ``Browse tabs`` if the mouse hovers over it.
It is useful to jump to a particular file directly, if many files are open.
You can also summon the file switcher through tapping ``Ctrl-Tab`` or ``Ctrl-P``, which navigates your tabs in most-recently-used order.


Environment variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Environment variables can be displayed from the IPython Console window (bottom right window in default layout).
Click on the ``Options`` menu ("Gear" icon), then select ``Show environment variables``.


Reset all customization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All customization saved on disk can be reset by calling Spyder from the command line with the switch ``--reset``, *i.e.* running ``spyder --reset``.


Objects in the Variable Explorer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Right-clicking on objects in the :guilabel:`Variable Explorer` displays options to plot and analyze these further.

Double-clicking on simple variables allows them to be edited directly, and double-clicking on objects opens a new window that displays their contents and often allows them to be edited.

Python collections (lists, dictionaries, tuples...), Numpy arrays, Pandas ``Index``, ``Series`` and ``DataFrame``, ``Pillow`` images and more can each be displayed and edited in specialized GUI viewers, and most arbitrary Python objects can be viewed, browsed and edited like their ``dict()`` representation.



===============================
Documentation string formatting
===============================

If you want to document the code you are developing (and you certainly should!), we recommend you write documentation strings (or *docstrings*) for it, using a special format called `reStructuredText (reST) <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`__.
In the scientific Python world, a further set of conventions called the `Numpydoc standard <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`__ is typically followed (although other systems exist).
If you follow those guidelines, you can obtain beautifully formatted docstrings in Spyder.

For example, to get an ``average()`` function look like this in the Spyder :guilabel:`Help` pane:

.. image:: images/spyder-nice-docstring-rendering.png
     :align: center

you need to format the documentation string as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    def average(a, b):
        """
        Return the average value (arithmetic mean) of two numbers.

        Parameters
        ----------
        a : numeric
            A number to average.
        b : numeric
            Another number to average.

        Returns
        -------
        result : numeric
            The average of a and b, computed using ``0.5 * (a + b)``.

        Example
        -------
        >>> average(5, 10)
        7.5

        """

        return (a + b) * 0.5

What matters here is that the word ``Parameters`` is used, and underlined.
The line ``a : numeric`` shows us that the type of the parameter ``a`` is ``numeric``.
In the next line, which is indented, we can write a more extended explanation of what this variable represents, what conditions the allowed types have to fulfill, etc.

The same for all parameters, and also for the returned value.

Often it is a good idea to include an example too, as shown.



=========
Debugging
=========

Line by line step execution of code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start debug execution (with the :menuselection:`Debug --> Debug` menu option or :kbd:`Ctrl-F5`) to activate the IPython debugger, ``ipdb``.
The :guilabel:`Editor` pane will then highlight the line that is about to be executed, and the :guilabel:`Variable Explorer` will display variables in the current context of the point of program execution.

After entering debug mode, you can execute the code line by line using the ``Step`` button of the :guilabel:`Debug` toolbar:

.. image:: images/debug-step-over.png
     :align: center

or the shortcut :kbd:`Ctrl-F10`.
You can also inspect how a particular function is working by stepping into it with the ``Step Into`` button

.. image:: images/debug-step-in.png
     :align: center

or the shortcut :kbd:`Ctrl-F11`.
Finally, to get out of a function and continue with the next line you need to use the ``Step Return`` button

.. image:: images/debug-step-out.png
     :align: center

or the shortcut :kbd:`Ctrl-Shift-F12`.

If you prefer to inspect your program at a specific point, you need to insert a
*breakpoint* by pressing :kbd:`F12` on the line on which you want to stop, or double-clicking to the left of the line number.
A red dot in this position indicates a breakpoint; it can be removed by repeating the same procedure.

After entering the Debugger, you can press the ``Continue`` button

.. image:: images/debug-continue.png
     :align: center

to stop the execution at the first breakpoint.

.. note::

   You can also control the debugging process by issuing these commands at the :guilabel:`Console` prompt:

   * ``n`` to move to the Next statement.

   * ``s`` to Step into the current statement. If this is a function call, step into that function.

   * ``r`` to complete all statements in the current function and return from that function before returning control.

Inside the debugger, you can also interactively execute many of the statements you can normally, including assigning and modifying variables, defining and calling functions, setting new breakpoints, and more.

For example, enter the following code into a new or temporary file::

   def demo(x):
       for i in range(5):
           print("i = {}, x = {}".format(i, x))
           x = x + 1

   demo(0)

If we execute this (:menuselection:`Run --> Run`), we should see the output:

.. code-block:: python

	i = 0, x = 0
	i = 1, x = 1
	i = 2, x = 2
	i = 3, x = 3
	i = 4, x = 4

Now run this using the debugger (:menuselection:`Debug --> Debug`), press the ``Step`` button until the highlighted line reaches the ``demo(0)`` function call, then press the ``Step into`` to inspect this function.
Keep pressing the ``Step`` button to execute the next lines.
Then, modify ``x`` by typing ``x = 10`` in the debugger prompt.
You should see ``x`` changing in the :guilabel:`Variable Explorer` and when its value is printed as part of the ``demo()`` function.
(The printed output appears between your debugger commands and responses).

This debugging ability to execute code line by line, to inspect variables as they change, and to modify them manually is a powerful tool to understand what a piece of code is doing (and to correct it if desired).

To terminate the debugger, you can type ``exit``, select :menuselection:`Debug --> Stop` or press :kbd:`Ctrl-Shift-F12`.


Debugging once an exception has occurred in the Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the :guilabel:`IPython Console`, we can call ``%debug`` straight after an exception has been raised: this will start the IPython debug mode, which allows inspection of local variables at the point where the exception occurred as described above.
This is a lot more efficient than adding ``print`` statements to the code an running it again.

If you use this, you may also want to use the commands ``up`` (*i.e.* press ``u`` at the debugger) and ``down`` (*i.e.* press ``d``) which navigate the inspection point up and down the stack.
(Up the stack means to the functions that have called the current function; down is the opposite direction).
You can also enable (or disable) this debugger being triggered automatically when an exception occurs by typing ``pdb`` at any time.



========
Plotting
========

You can decide whether figures created with Matplotlib will show

* *Inline*, *i.e.* inside the :guilabel:`IPython Console`, or

* Inside a *new window*, with an options toolbar.

The first option is convenient to save a record of the interactive session (:kbd:`Ctrl-S` `in the console <save-shortcut-console-ref_>`_).

The second option allows you to interactively zoom into the figure, manipulate it, set various plot and display options, and save it to different file formats via a menu.

The command to get the figures to appear *inline* in the :guilabel:`IPython Console` is:

.. code-block:: python

    In [ ]: %matplotlib inline

The command to get figures appear in their own window (rendered by the Qt backend) is:

.. code-block:: python

    In [ ]: %matplotlib qt

The Spyder preferences can be used to customize the default behavior, under  :menuselection:`Preferences --> IPython Console --> Graphics --> Graphics Backend`.

Here are two lines you can use to quickly create a plot and test this:

.. code-block:: python

    In [ ]: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    In [ ]: plt.plot(range(10), 'o')
