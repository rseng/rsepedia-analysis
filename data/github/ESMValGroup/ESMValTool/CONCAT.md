# Introduction

ESMValTool is a community-developed climate model diagnostics and evaluation software package, driven
both by computational performance and scientific accuracy and reproducibility. ESMValTool is open to both
users and developers, encouraging open exchange of diagnostic source code and evaluation results from the
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project [CMIP](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip) ensemble. For a
comprehensive introduction to ESMValTool please visit our
[documentation](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/introduction.html) page.

# Running esmvaltool

Diagnostics from ESMValTool are run using [recipe](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/recipes/index.html)
files that contain pointers to the requested data types, directives for the preprocessing steps that data
will be subject to, and directives for the actual diagnostics that will be run with the now preprocessed data.
Data preprocessing is done via the [ESMValCore](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/ESMValCore/en/latest/quickstart/index.html) package, a pure Python, highly-optimized scientific library, developed by the ESMValTool core developers,
and that performs a number of common analysis tasks
such as regridding, masking, levels extraction etc. [Diagnostics](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/develop/diagnostic.html) are written in a variety of programming languages (Python, NCL, R, Julia) and are developed by the wider
scientific community, and included after a scientific and technical review process.

# Input data

ESMValTool can run with the following types of data as input:

- CMIP5
- CMIP6
- OBS, OBS6
- obs4MIPs
- ana4mips
- CORDEX

# Getting started

Please see [getting started](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/index.html) on readthedocs as well as [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/index.html). The tutorial is a set of lessons that together teach skills needed to work with ESMValTool in climate-related domains.

## Getting help

The easiest way to get help if you cannot find the answer in the documentation on [readthedocs](https://docs.esmvaltool.org), is to open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/issues).

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute a new diagnostic or feature, please have a look at our [contribution guidelines](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/community/index.html).

ESMVal python library
=====================

General structure
-----------------

This directory contains usefull scripts and tools for ESMVal which are to support the writing of diagnostics in a clean and short way.

In general you have two options to include code into this library.

A) you have some small code snippet that is needed somewhere else (e.g. a special function).
In this case you should put your code into either a new file in the 'python' directory or an already existing file.
Let's say that you have developed some statistics test functionality, then it would be good to put it in a file statistics.py

However, more importantly it is important to recognize that python is in general organized in modules (http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html#more-on-modules).
Modules shall ever been used if you are working with bigger projects or code which encapsulated some functionality in different code parts (e.g. a bigger statistical library, a plotting library ...)

B) Modules are simply organized in directories which and contain an additional __init__.py file which tells the python interpreter which files are part of the module.
Using modules allows you to load entire packages as a whole or parts of it into your code using e.g.

from scipy import stats

Thus the ESMVal python library is supposed to look like e.g.

/lib+
    |_python+
            |_my_cool_collection_of_snippets.py
            |_plots.py
            |_statlib+
                     |___init__.py
                     |_linear_regressions.py
                     |_pdf.py
                     |_stattests.py
