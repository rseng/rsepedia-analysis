# McSim-Cycle-accurate-NoC: Manycore platform Simulation tool for NoC-based platform at a Cycle-accurate level

This repository contains a simulator able to simulate embedded applications described using
the [AMALTHEA](http://www.amalthea-project.org/) application model on top of NoC-based manycore architectures in a cycle accurate way. This simulator is based on [NoCTweak](https://sourceforge.net/projects/noctweak/) and has been developed by the LIRMM laboratory of Montpellier.

To get the simulator you must clone this repository and its submodules. To clone the repository if you have a GitHub account with an SSH key registered use `git clone git@github.com:DreamCloud-Project/McSim-Cycle-accurate-NoC.git`. Else use `git clone https://github.com/DreamCloud-Project/McSim-Cycle-accurate-NoC.git`. Then do `cd McSim-Cycle-accurate-NoC` followed by `git submodule init` followed by `git submodule update` to clone submodules.

## Using the simulator

To ease the usage of the simulator, two python scripts are provided:  

- compile.py for compilation  
- simulate.py for launching the simulation  

The requirements for using these scripts are the following ones:  

- have a Linux system
- have a C++ compiler
- have CMake installed on your system ([https://cmake.org](https://cmake.org/))
- have SystemC 2.3.1
    * download SystemC (Core SystemC Language and Examples) from here http://accellera.org/downloads/standards/systemc/systemc-license-agreement
    * decompress the archive
    * run `configure` and then `make install` 
    * you should see a new `include` folder and a new `lib-linux64` folder in your root folder of SystemC 
    * define the `SYSTEMC_HOME` environment variable to the root folder of SystemC 
- have the xerces-c-dev library installed in standard includes and libs folders (using `apt-get install libxerces-c-dev` for example on Ubuntu)
  or have xerces-c-dev library in a custom folder and define `XERCES_HOME` environment variable

### Compiling the simulator

Compilation is done through the `compile.py` script which documentation is the following:  

```
>> ./compile.py --help
usage: compile.py [-h] [-v] {build,clean} ...

Cycle accurate simulator compiler script

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose  enable verbose output

valid subcommands:
  {build,clean}
```

### Running the simulator

To run a particular simulation, just run the `simulate.py` script. By
default this script runs one iteration of the Demo Car application on
a 4x4 NoC using ZigZag mapping, First Come First Serve (fcfs)
scheduling and without repeating periodic runnables.  You can play
with all these parameters which documentation is the following:

```
>>./simulate.py --help
usage: simulate.py [-h] [-d] [-bs {1,2,4,8,16}] [-da {DC}]
                   [-ca CUSTOM_APPLICATION] [-f FREQ] [-mf MODES_FILE]
                   [-m MAPPING_STRATEGY [MAPPING_STRATEGY ...]] [-mw]
                   [-mww MICRO_WORKLOAD_WIDTH] [-mwh MICRO_WORKLOAD_HEIGHT]
                   [-np] [-nvc {1,2,4,8,16}] [-o OUTPUT_FOLDER] [-r]
                   [-s {prio}] [-v] [-x ROWS] [-y COLS]

                        cores and labels on memories. Valide strategies are
