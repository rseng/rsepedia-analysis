# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at pynn-maintainers@protonmail.com. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

PyNN
====

PyNN (pronounced '*pine*') is a simulator-independent language for building
neuronal network models.

In other words, you can write the code for a model once, using the PyNN API and
the Python programming language, and then run it without modification on any
simulator that PyNN supports (currently NEURON, NEST and Brian 2) and
on a number of neuromorphic hardware systems.

The PyNN API aims to support modelling at a high-level of abstraction
(populations of neurons, layers, columns and the connections between them) while
still allowing access to the details of individual neurons and synapses when
required. PyNN provides a library of standard neuron, synapse and synaptic
plasticity models, which have been verified to work the same on the different
supported simulators. PyNN also provides a set of commonly-used connectivity
algorithms (e.g. all-to-all, random, distance-dependent, small-world) but makes
it easy to provide your own connectivity in a simulator-independent way.

Even if you don't wish to run simulations on multiple simulators, you may
benefit from writing your simulation code using PyNN's powerful, high-level
interface. In this case, you can use any neuron or synapse model supported by
your simulator, and are not restricted to the standard models.
