***Bi**osynthetic **G**ene clusters - **S**uper **Li**near **C**lustering **E**ngine*

Quick start
---------------------
1. Make sure you have [HMMer](http://hmmer.org/) (version 3.2b1 or later) installed.
2. Install **BiG-SLiCE** using pip:
- from PyPI (stable)
~~~console
user@local:~$ pip install bigslice
~~~
- from source (bleeding edge)
~~~console
user@local:~$ git clone git@github.com:medema-group/bigslice.git
user@local:~$ pip install ./bigslice/
~~~
3. Fetch the latest HMM models (Â± 470MB gzipped):
~~~console
user@local:~$ download_bigslice_hmmdb
~~~
4. Check your installation:
~~~console
user@local:~$ bigslice --version .
~~~
5. Run **BiG-SLiCE** clustering analysis: (see [wiki:Input folder](https://github.com/medema-group/bigslice/wiki/Input-folder) on how to prepare the input folder)
~~~console
user@local:~$ bigslice -i <input_folder> <output_folder>
~~~
For a "minimal" test run, you can use the [example input folder](https://github.com/medema-group/bigslice/tree/master/misc/input_folder_template) that we provided.

**!Important!** Please read [this note](https://github.com/medema-group/bigslice/issues/19) before taking results from **BiG-SLiCE** for your analysis.

Querying [antiSMASH](https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/) BGCs
---------------------
Using the `--query` mode, you can perform a blazing-fast query of a putative BGC against the pre-processed set of Gene Cluster Family (GCF) models that **BiG-SLiCE** outputs (for example, you can use our [pre-processed result on ~1.2M microbial BGCs from the NCBI database](http://bioinformatics.nl/~kauts001/ltr/bigslice/paper_data/data/full_run_result.zip) -- a 17GB zipped file download). You will get a ranked list of GCFs and BGCs similar to the BGC in question, which will help in determining the function and/or novelty of said BGC. To perform a GCF query, simply use:
~~~console
user@local:~$ bigslice --query <antismash_output_folder> --n_ranks <int> <output_folder>
~~~
Which will perform a query analysis on the latest clustering result contained inside the output folder (see [wiki: Program parameters](https://github.com/medema-group/bigslice/wiki/Program-parameters) for more advanced options). Top-(n_ranks) matching GCFs will be returned along with their similarity measurements. You can then view the query results using the user interactive output (see below).

Custom GenBank input
---------------------
To perform GCF analyses on BGCs not covered by antiSMASH/MIBiG (i.e., from tools like [ClusterFinder](https://github.com/petercim/ClusterFinder) and [DeepBGC](https://github.com/Merck/deepbgc), or BGCs with manually-refined cluster borders), you can use the [converter script](https://github.com/medema-group/bigslice/blob/master/misc/generate_antismash_gbk/generate_antismash_gbk.py) that we provided, which will take a (genome) GenBank file along with a comma-separated descriptor file for every BGCs to be generated (please see the example input files provided in the [script's folder](https://github.com/medema-group/bigslice/blob/master/misc/generate_antismash_gbk/generate_antismash_gbk.py)).

User Interactive output
---------------------
**BiG-SLiCE**'s output folder contains both the processed input data (in the form of an [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database file) and some scripts that power a mini web-app to visualize that data. To run this visualization engine, follow these steps:
1. Fulfill the web-app's package requirements:
~~~console
user@local:~$ pip install -r <output_folder>/requirements.txt
~~~
2. Run the [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) server:
~~~console
user@local:~$ bash <output_folder>/start_server.sh <port(optional)>
~~~
3. Open an internet browser, then go to the URL described by the previous step:
- e.g. `* Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)`
- then go to `http://0.0.0.0:5000` in your browser

Programmatic Access and Postprocessing
---------------------
To access **BiG-SLiCE**'s preprocessed data, (advanced) users need to be able to [run SQL(ite) queries](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-select/). Although the learning curve might be steeper compared to the conventional tabular-formatted output files, once familiarized, the SQL database can provide an easy-to-use yet very powerful data wrangling experience. Please refer to [our publication manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.17.240838) to get an idea of what kind of things are able to be done with the output data. Additionally, you can also [download and reuse some jupyter notebook scripts](https://bioinformatics.nl/~kauts001/ltr/bigslice/paper_data/scripts/) that we wrote to perform all analyses and generate figures for the manuscript.

What kind of software is this, anyway?
---------------------
![bgc_gcf_illustration](https://i.ibb.co/FmBfmHW/bgc-gcf-illustration.png)

Bacteria and fungi produce a vast array of bioactive compounds in nature, which can be useful for us as antibiotics (see [this list](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.mib.2009.07.002)), antivirals (see [this list](https://doi.org/10.1038/ja.2017.115)) and anticancer drugs (see [Salinisporamide](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2008.10.075)). To optimize and retain the production of those complex chemical agents, microbes organize the responsible genes into genomic 'clumps' colloquially termed as **"Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs)"** (above picture, left panel). Using bioinformatics tools such as [antiSMASH](https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/), we can now take a genome sequence to identify BGCs and predict the secondary metabolites that the organism may produce (see [this example analysis for the _S. coelicolor_ genome](https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/upload/example/index.html)). Furthermore, by doing a large scale comparative analysis of homologous BGCs sharing similar domain architectures (we call them **"Gene Cluster Families (GCFs)"**), we can practically chart an atlas of biosynthetic diversity among all sequenced microbes (above picture, right panel).

![figure_1](https://i.ibb.co/0twfQ81/figure-1.png)

To enable such a large scale analysis, **BiG-SLiCE** was specifically designed with **scalability** and **speed** as the #1 priority (Figure 1A), as opposed to our previous tool, [BiG-SCAPE](https://git.wageningenur.nl/medema-group/BiG-SCAPE), which was able to sensitively capture the slightest difference of both domain architecture and sequence similarity between pairs of BGCs (see [our paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-019-0400-9) for the details). As a result, **BiG-SLiCE** can reliably take an **input data of more than 1.2 million BGCs and process it in less than a week runtime using 36-cores machine with 128GB RAM** (Figure 1B) while keeping enough sensitivity to delineate the essential biosynthetic 'signals' among the input BGCs (Figure 1C). Moreover, to facilitate exploration and investigation of the analysis results, **BiG-SLiCE** also produce an **interactive, easy-to-use output visualization** that can be run with minimal software / hardware requirements.

This software was initially developed and is currently maintained by **Satria Kautsar** (twitter: [@satriaphd](https://twitter.com/satriaphd)) as part of a fully funded PhD project granted to **Dr. Marnix Medema** (website: [marnixmedema.nl](http://marnixmedema.nl), twitter: [@marnixmedema](https://twitter.com/marnixmedema)) by the [Graduate School of Experimental Plant Sciences, NL](https://www.graduateschool-eps.info/). Contributions and feedbacks are very welcomed. Feel free to drop us an e-mail if you have any question regarding or related to **BiG-SLiCE**. In the future, we aim to make **BiG-SLiCE** a comprehensive platform to do all sorts of downstream large scale BGC analysis, taking advantage of its portable and powerful [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)-based data storage combined with the flexible [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)-based web app architecture as the foundation.
