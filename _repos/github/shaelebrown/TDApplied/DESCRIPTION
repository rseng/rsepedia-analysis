Description: Topological data analysis is a powerful tool for finding non-linear global structure
    in whole datasets. The main tool of topological data analysis is persistent homology, which computes
    a topological shape descriptor of a dataset called a persistence diagram. 'TDApplied' provides 
    useful and efficient methods for analyzing groups of persistence diagrams with machine learning and statistical inference,
    and these functions can also interface with other data science packages to form flexible and integrated
    topological data analysis pipelines.
