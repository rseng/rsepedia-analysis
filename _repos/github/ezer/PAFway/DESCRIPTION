Description: Finds pairs of functional annotations or gene ontology (GO) 
    terms that are enriched within a directed network (such as a gene
    regulatory network).  This works with or without edge weights and
    includes visualizations (both as a network where the functions are
    nodes and as a heatmap).  PAFway is an acronym for Pairwise Associations of 
    Functional annotations in biological networks and pathWAYs.
