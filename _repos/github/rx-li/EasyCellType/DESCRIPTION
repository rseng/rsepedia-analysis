Description: We developed EasyCellType which can automatically examine the input marker lists obtained from existing software such as Seurat over the cell markerdatabases. Two quantification approaches to annotate cell types are provided: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and a modified versio of Fisher's exact test. The function presents annotation recommendations in graphical outcomes: bar plots for each cluster showing candidate cell types, as well as a dot plot summarizing the top 5 significant annotations for each cluster.
