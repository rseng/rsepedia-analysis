Description: The package aims to infer ncRNA synergistic competition from transcriptomics data and putative miRNA-target interactions.
    It provides several functions to study ncRNA synergistic competition, including a function for inferring ceRNA networks 
    , and a function to identify ncRNA synergistic competition networks, as well as several functions to conduct downstream
    analysis of the synergistic competition ncRNAs.
