Description: Some functions for performing ICA, MICA, Group ICA, and Multilinear ICA are implemented.
    ICA, MICA/Group ICA, and Multilinear ICA extract statistically independent components from single matrix, multiple matrices, and single tensor, respectively.
    For the details of these methods, see the reference section of GitHub README.md <https://github.com/rikenbit/iTensor>.
