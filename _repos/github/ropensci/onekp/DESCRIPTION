    The 1000 Plants Initiative (www.onekp.com) has sequenced the transcriptomes
    of over 1000 plant species. This package allows these sequences and
    metadata to be retrieved and filtered by code, species or recursively by
    clade.  Scientific names and NCBI taxonomy IDs are both supported.
