Title: Work with 'GitHub' 'Gists'
Description: Work with 'GitHub' 'gists' from 'R' (e.g., 
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Gist>, 
    <https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-gists/>). A 'gist'
    is simply one or more files with code/text/images/etc. This package allows
    the user to create new 'gists', update 'gists' with new files, rename files,
    delete files, get and delete 'gists', star and 'un-star' 'gists', fork 'gists',
    open a 'gist' in your default browser, get embed code for a 'gist', list
    'gist' 'commits', and get rate limit information when 'authenticated'. Some
    requests require authentication and some do not. 'Gists' website: 
    <https://gist.github.com/>.
