Description: Tools to help download, process and analyse the UK road collision data collected using the
  'STATS19' form. The data are provided as 'CSV' files with detailed road safety data about the
  circumstances of car crashes and other incidents on the roads resulting in 
  casualties in Great Britain from 1979, the types
  (including make and model) of vehicles involved and the consequential casualties.  The
  statistics relate only to personal casualties on public roads that are reported
  to the police, and subsequently recorded, using the 'STATS19' accident reporting form. See
  the Department for Transport website 
  <https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data> for more
  information on these data.
