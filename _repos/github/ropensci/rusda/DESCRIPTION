Description: An interface to the web service methods provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) provides a large set of databases. The current version of the package holds interfaces to the Systematic Mycology and Microbiology Laboratory (SMML), which consists of four databases: Fungus-Host Distributions, Specimens, Literature and the Nomenclature database. It provides functions for querying these databases. The main function is \code{associations}, which allows searching for fungus-host combinations.
