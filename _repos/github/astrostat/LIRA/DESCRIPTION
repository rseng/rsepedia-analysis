Description: This package is designed for multi-scale non-parametric image analysis for use in high-energy astrophysics. The code implements an MCMC sampler that simultaneously fits the image and the necessary tuning/smoothing parameters in the model. The model-based approach allows for quantification of the standard error of the fitted image and can be used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of a proposed model.
