pyarrow  # to read parquet, which is very handy for big datasets
seaborn  # for nice plots
astropy  # for reading .fits (not yet implemented, but likely to be added)
wandb  # optional, for saving metrics to weights&biases (cloud service, free within limits)

# and for pytorch, optionally (assuming linux, cuda 11.3, pytorch 10.2):

# conda install pytorch==1.10.1 torchvision==0.11.2 torchaudio==0.10.1 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch -c conda-forge
# python -m pip install detectron2 -f \
#   https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detectron2/wheels/cu113/torch1.10/index.html
# pip install pytorch-lightning simplejpeg albumentations pyro-ppl==1.8.0

# (latest pyro currently forces pytorch 1.11.0, which is not yet released for detectron2 (1.10 only), probably causing cuda errors)

# and for the datamodule code, including various galaxy datasets dataset:
