Description: We propose DENDRO, a statistical framework takes scRNA-seq data 
  for a tumor and accurately reconstructs its phylogeny, assigning each single 
  cell from the scRNA-seq data to a subclone. Our approach allows us to (1) 
  cluster cells based on genomic profiles while accounting for transcriptional 
  bursting, technical dropout and sequencing error, as benchmarked on in silico 
  mixture and a spike-in analysis, (2) make robust mutation profile inference 
  in subclonal resolution, and (3) perform DNA-RNA joint analysis with same set 
  of cells and examine the relationship between transcriptomic variation and 
  mutation profile. In addition,
