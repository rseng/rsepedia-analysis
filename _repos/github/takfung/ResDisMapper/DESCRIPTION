Title: Calculates and maps environmental resistance to dispersal over a landscape
Version: 1.1
Description: Provides functions to (1) Read in genetic data and geographic coordinates for individuals over a landscape, model Isolation by Distance (IBD) and calculate IBD residuals; (2) Plot IBD residuals for pairs of individuals in a population, as represented by line segments over the defined landscape; (3) Calculate environmental resistance to dispersal over the landscape using the IBD residuals and a novel method; and (4) Create a map of the resistance values over the landscape. The novel method of calculating resistance is detailed in Tang et al. (2020).
