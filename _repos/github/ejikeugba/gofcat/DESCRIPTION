Description: A post-estimation method for categorical response models (CRM). 
    Inputs from objects of class serp(), clm(), polr(), multinom(), mlogit(), 
    vglm() and glm() are currently supported. Available tests include the 
    Hosmer-Lemeshow tests for the binary, multinomial and ordinal logistic 
    regression; the Lipsitz and the Pulkstenis-Robinson tests for the ordinal 
    models. The proportional odds, adjacent-category, and constrained continuation-ratio 
    models are particularly supported at ordinal level. Tests for the proportional 
    odds assumptions in ordinal models are also possible with the Brant and the 
    Likelihood-Ratio tests. Moreover, several summary measures of predictive strength 
    (Pseudo R-squared), and some useful error metrics, including, the brier 
    score, misclassification rate and logloss are also available for the 
    binary, multinomial and ordinal models. Ugba, E. R. and Gertheiss, J. (2018)
