Description: scLINE is a R package for dimension reduction 
    of single-cell RNA-seq data. scLINE integrates the
    single-cell data and multiple gene networks collated from
    public databases, supplementing inter-gene interactions
    to solve the problem of missing information caused by
    drop-out events.
