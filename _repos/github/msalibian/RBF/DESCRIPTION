Description: A robust backfitting algorithm for additive models based on (robust) local polynomial 
             kernel smoothers. It includes both bounded and re-descending (kernel) M-estimators, and
             it computes predictions for points outside the training set if desired. See
             Boente, Martinez and Salibian-Barrera (2017) <doi:10.1080/10485252.2017.1369077> and 
             Martinez and Salibian-Barrera (2021) <doi:10.21105/joss.02992> for details.
